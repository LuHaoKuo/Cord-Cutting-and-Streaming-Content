He fought against financial and media interests to make ST and ST:TNG what it was; idealized, intelligent, thoughtful, full of ethical dilemmas and social commentaries. It was supposed to be a glimpse at what we could become, if we wanted to. Now that he's gone and they've cashed in I feel they've lost their way. It's now an action movie/show franchise.

For College football you will have less options of games if you have only local channels but if you must watch every game on the weekends there are apps for that...usually $10/month or so.

This is where the Ultra benefits by letting you add a small microSD card to boost app storage (both models have 512MB onboard, but none of the Sticks or Express have microSD).  Roku sells a 2GB card for $5, others need to be tried (I've had many 4-8GB cards work, but some didn't).

Overall your TVFool report has much better Noise Margins than mine, so you’d likely do great with a smaller ClearStream 2v.  There’s a seller from Niagara Falls on that world famous auction site that commonly has open box 2v models for $25-$30.  I don’t sweat going open box for antennas, as I figure someone tried it out but realized they didn’t have the right option for their location.

Another poster mentioned the possibility of having to sacrifice VHF reception (Real channels 2 through 13).  I like how the 2v &amp; 4v models offer the alternate mounting of the dipole as shown in these instructions, so as to better point toward your weakest desired VHF tower:  https://www.antennasdirect.com/cmss_files/attachmentlibrary/2016%20PDF%20QuickStart%20Guides/C4-V-CJM_QS_FINAL_20140723.pdf

DTVN Pros: The best channel lineup of all the streaming services, arguably the best picture quality of all the services, reasonably priced for what you get, and

&amp;#x200B;

DTVN Cons: Reliability (I've been fortunate enough to not really have any issues, but a lot of people do), DVR functionality can be hit or miss (again, I haven't had any problems thankfully) and is only 20 hrs, customer service sucks, only two streams unless you pony up more cash, you can't rewind live tv, and the UI isn't the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Hulu Live Pros: Probably the best bang for your buck considering it's on the cheaper end of all of the services PLUS the rest of Hulu is available to you as well as part of your sub, you can rewind live tv, and the DVR is serviceable.

&amp;#x200B;

Hulu Live Cons: Reliability (People complain often about hitches in the streams, again I haven't experienced these issues myself), UI is so-so, only two streams unless you pay for more, DVR is only 50 hrs, to make the channel lineup comparable to DTVN you'll have to sub to Philo for $16.

* Netflix is worldwide, but Hulu is limited to the USA.
* Netflix has lots more original content.
* Netflix has all the shows from CW, which is the network I watch the most shows on, and Hulu doesn't air CW shows anymore.
* Netflix has been commercial-free from the beginning, while Hulu has only recently offered a commercial free package.
* Netflix is cheaper than commercial-free Hulu.
* Hulu competes directly with TV, because it focuses on streaming the latest episodes of current TV shows, whereas Netflix supplements TV by letting you binge past seasons of shows that you can no longer find on TV.

BTW, Netflix does inform you of when shows are leaving ahead of time. Whenever I resubscribe to Netflix, I check my list to see which shows on it are leaving soon. Also, when I recently watched an episode of InuYasha, it showed me a notice that it was leaving soon. Since it looks like that show has now been renewed and is not leaving, I put Batman Begins in my list, which is scheduled to leave tomorrow. My list says ""Available Until 9/1/2018"", but when I started the movie, it did not give me any further notice that it will be leaving. However, it doesn't inform you when you are browsing through recommended content. I tried this again with Iris, a Korean drama that is scheduled to leave on September 24, but it didn't inform me of it leaving.

Heck, I even find the original campy Batman movie with Adam West and his “shark repellant” spray can more entertaining and artistically redeeming than recent big-budget superhero movies.

If it was me, and I wasn’t able to move, and I worked from home, I’d find a way to keep the 60MBS internet. It’s way more than enough. I’d probably buy a Roku streaming stick for $40-50 and try out various streaming options. I’d start with the free ones. Roku has apps for a ton of free content. I personally really like Pluto TV, which would get you lots of news choices, comedy, sci-fi, cooking shows, etc for free. The Roku channel is pretty good too. Lots of shows and movies for free with commercials. If none of the free channels do it for you, start experimenting with the for pay options. Netflix, Hulu, Philo, PS Vue, Youtube tV, whatever. They all offer free trials, usually for a week to a month. Just bounce around until you find something you like and can afford. 

The other option is to buy a cheap inside TV antenna ($25 or less) to get all of your local channels for free. Since you’re in a city, that might work out well. You’d be surprised how many channels and how much content is free over the air. 

Lots of options to get free or inexpensive content other than having to get continually screwed over by the big cable companies. ",1534548435

cordcutters,"I hate hate and hate posts like this. First of all, they never ever factor in that either way, the OP is paying for internet. Nor do they factor in the taxes, rental fees especially for multiple tvs, broadcast and sports fees and other miscellaneous charges. 

They also don't factor in many cable tv subscribers still subscribe to Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime. They don't count those in but they do count them on the cordcutter side. 

Secondly they assume that people want live tv and that they want to recreate cable tv. They also assume people would sign up for everything and also never cancel any service. Especially for channels like HBO, many people only subscribe for less than 6 months a year. 

They never consider the non-promotional rates. I have been with Comcast a long time, I don't qualify for promo rates. But I don't have a contract and I don't have any ETF to worry about. 

I cut the cord about seven years ago. I did not have any new subscriber promo pricing at the time - just double internet+tv package. When I cut, I had Performance + basic limited cable tv packages and rented a cable box for a then standard definition tv. It was about $79 to $87 approximately counting fees and taxes. I had no DVR, no on demand, and about eight to 10 channels. 

Basically I cut the cord because every time Comcast, pushed a group of favorite channels up to a more expensive tier, I had no reason to pay for the existing tier and dropped to a lower one. The first group to go was the then Sci-fi channel (now SyFy). Basic cable tv was frustrating and limited. I got more shopping, Spanish, and religion channels than anything else. I had to pay a fee for sports even though I didn't have ESPN. I had to pay to rent a box. I had taxes. To supplement it, I had to get the Netflix DVD and then later the Netflix streaming service and Hulu. These were each about $8 a piece then. (I have had Prime but I don't think I did before i cut the cord.)  I found I was using these more than the TV. I eventually ran out of tv tiers to cut and the fees were jacked up about another $15 so I cut the cord and dropped down to Performance Starter which was 6/1 then. I still have Performance Starter which is now 15/2. (Not upgrading since they don't sell 25/5 here). The price has gone up a bit I think in seven years but all internet plans have.

I value on demand more than live tv. I have absolutely no interest in recreating the cable tv I had. If I were to, it would consist of an antenna, some roku channels for shopping and religion and the CSPAN website because literally that is what I had. And I am more interested in shows not channels so recreating something others had doesn't really make sense to me. 

Currently:

* Internet: I pay $49.99 (non promo rate) for Performance Starter and $0 for taxes. I own my own modem so no rental fees.
(I would still pay for internet but I wouldn't be allowed to keep this plan, i would have to pay for a more expensive faster plan). I have no data cap but even if I did, I use nowhere near most data caps. 

* Hulu: My plan is $7.99 but my $5.99 promo rate was just renewed. No taxes. 

* CBS All Access: I currently am not subscribed but when I do sign up again for the winter it will be $5.99. I rotate between services because some like CBS don't have new episodes in the summer. This is something I cannot do with cable tv. 


* Antenna. Free to watch. i paid about $35 for the Winegard Flatwave antenna about 5 or so years ago. I currently get over 25 channels or sub-channels although I probably only watch about 6 or 7 regularly. I don't use a DVR.

* Hoopla Digital, Vudu Movies on Us, TubiTV, Roku Channel, NewsON, PBS, CBS News, YouTube, etc. Tons of movies and shows and videos. The DVD collection at my public library. All free $0. 


So my current monthly cost, assuming I am actually subscribed to CBS All Access is: $49.99 + $5.99 + $5.99 = **$61.97.** So this is actually still less than what I paid for cable tv and I still have more shows and movies than I did then.

cordcutters,It's become this weird...I don't want to say addiction because that's probably not the word...but like an obsession with saving money cord cutting that it's gotten to the point that I spend more time researching new ways to watch tv than I do actually watching tv.,1534172739
cordcutters,"Most of those restrictions have been lifted. There are still some restrictions in place for devices you can use before you have to reconnect them to your home network, but that's mainly to prevent folks from being cheap and sharing their subscription with others. ",1533143857
cordcutters,"Same as the less ads/non ads version of CBS All Access. However you sign in for the less ads/non ad version, you would do the same thing for this version. (I have only signed up via CBS.com). It is basically the $5.99 All Access plan but available through Amazon. ",1534799408
cordcutters,"Same on my end. Live in Washington D.C. and pay $89 for 150 Mbps or $93 for 250 Mbps so went with the 250... Still ungodly high cost for just internet I feel like...   


Also just cut the cord finally to internet only! Wondering if I should get an antenna to use!",1534261417
cordcutters,"The last time I had a Comcast tech out, he spent most of his time trying to up-sell me, or bad-mouth streaming etc. I had to be less than polite to get him to stop it, and fix what he was there for. Probably not his fault, I'd wager they're under pressure to sell.",1534176535
cordcutters,"Why stay away from directv now? Just curious.  Hulu live sounds more appealing to me but directv customer service mentioned they may not make me pay to cancel my contract if I sign up for their streaming.  For that reason only I may consider it for a few months.  ",1534895285
cordcutters,"YoutubeTV has every major channel I want. Yes, it would be nice to have Comedy Central and NHL Network but I can live without them. I've yet to have any technical issues in 6+ months of having it. Unless a missing channel is a dealbreaker to you, I'd go with YTTV.",1534962538
cordcutters,"would be strange for the RSN, Fox Sports North here to be all of a sudden Youtube Sports North or Amazon Sports North, saying they'd go that route, who knows though they could end up buying all the RSN's one of them and end up shaking up all the regional stuff too",1534332757
cordcutters,"Thanks for the review.  You are the first person I've found who is actually using them.  

I'm also looking at the  AT&amp;T unlimited plans, but one prohibits mobile hotspots and the other limits them to 10GB/month.  Is there a different plan you are looking at?

I saw this link on reddit this morning [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/at-t-prepaid-sim-kit/6235500.p?skuId=6235500](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/at-t-prepaid-sim-kit/6235500.p?skuId=6235500), but that doesn't tell me anything about the details of the plan.",1533937250
cordcutters,"You can but it involves getting rid of technology. If you use less than 22GB per month, it is cheaper. Unfortunately most of us have all kinds of other devices that also need an internet connection for advanced functions to work so an always on service is needed.

Supposedly, 5G cellular is going to change things but living in a rural area all of my life; I doubt it changes much for me. We have always been in that hard to reach last mile that is always promised but rarely delivered and never at a reasonable price. ",1535133007
cordcutters,"I'm not sure if it still a viable option, however, I was able to set my parents up with this device on the ATT Unlimted Plus One Plan:

https://www.att.com/cellphones/att/att-wireless-internet.html#sku=sku8550279

They live in a semi-rural area and get a strong 3 bars of LTE. I also set them up with DTVnow, which comes with HBO since they have the One Plus Plan. They use Roku's for streaming a lot of content, and use way over 500GB/month and never complain about slow speeds or buffering. So with this you would get a ""home"" phone, unlimited data and discount on DTVnow (possibly HBO, not sure if it is still a deal). I remote in sometimes to help them, and every time I check the internet speeds, which never goes below 10Mbps (I would say average is around 15Mbps). YMMV. I wouldn't hesitate to tell people to at least give this a try based on their experience, and would be the first thing I looked into if I found myself moving to a similar situation.

FYI, their monthly ""phone"" bill from ATT is about $108. The DTVNow is $20 (I think) with the discount from the One Plus Plan.

During my research for them, I also came across places like this:

I don't know anything about what they provide or how they provide, just that it may be an option.",1533832400

cordcutters,"I contacted them last week and was disappointed to find out that they just use AT&amp;T’s equipment and you can’t put it into bridge mode to bypass their NAT limitations. Most users will not run into this problem but AT&amp;T’s equipment can only handle about 2400 sessions at a time before crapping out. Tons of stories on the web about small businesses hitting the session limit and their internet just stops working until old sessions expire. 

Sticking with Comcast for now as they let me use my own equipment. ",1533180882

I'm saying maybe, just maybe, that was an exaggeration and seeing the internet continue to improve even after the repeal suggests that maybe, just maybe, we'll be ok.

If it ends up that in 6 months or a year I can't log in to the internet anymore or that it has changed substantially, I'll say NN was needed and needs to be brought back. But I go on evidence. ",1534886216
cordcutters,"Looks like you'll be filing a credit card dispute.  You need to show the Card company your original payment was December 22, along with the email describing the service, and that it was advertised as ""30-to-31 movies per month"" but now it's changed to ""just 3 movies"", and therefore you want a complete refund.  (Also include the email from MoviePass saying you're entitled to a refund.)

- You might have to settle for just 50% refund from the credit card, but that's still better than MoviePass's offer of zero refund.

https://forum.silicondust.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=92&amp;t=69229

""Why are shows playing at the wrong time? And why are shows not matched up to the channel guide?
Premium TV has two airing regions: East coast and West coast. The majority of America will receive the East coast feed. The west coast will receive the West coast feed. For everyone in the west coast, your feed should behave exactly like every other west coast cable provider. The people on the east coast will mostly see the same as other east coast providers, however, USA, FX, SYFY, Paramount Network, TruTV, Comedy Central, Discovery, TLC, Bravo, Animal Planet, MTV, VH1, CMT, Disney, Nickelodeon, and Freeform will all air at at their west coast time slots. 

If you are grabbing your own guide data for use with a 3rd party, you will need to choose west coast slots for these channels. Guide data should be correct on the official HDHomeRun apps and any apps that have provided official updates with their own supplied guide data. """,1534781137
cordcutters,"I have a lot of thoughts on this.  Plex is awesome because of the lifetime Plex Pass...but I feel like the offering is short since it won't do a direct pass through to the AppleTVs.  Channels decodes the signal right there on the AppleTV which is what allows it to direct tune a channel much faster.

I too am in a similar situation.  Though right now I am using a TiVo for my DVR purposes, I'm testing out Plex DVR and Channels DVR.  I think the only thing keeping me back from Channels DVR full time is the commercial skip.  TiVos version is flawless...so I've been spoiled.  But itis unrealistic for a crew of 2 developers to tag every episode like TiVo does.

I've also found that my guide info has been incorrect for my recordings in Plex.  I recorded Dateline for my wife to try out Plex, and none of the recordings had the proper description to them.

I'm not a big fan of removing commercials like Plex DVR does.  I would much rather it tag it and let me do skipping if i want.

Just a few thoughts from a long time lurker...",1534870003
cordcutters,"Yeah, roughly $30/month. For a huge selection of on demand, ad-free content (you could save $4/month with Hulu and watch a few ads, but I think the $4 is a fucking steal and worth every penny. How much did your old cable company charge you to remove commercials?).

And since you don't like some of it, you're not paying for it. By my estimates, since you don't like Netflix and you used premium channel upgrades in the hypothetical, you're paying no more than $25 a month (and that's assuming you're not sharing an account with friends/family... Because if you're not, you should be). Is that anywhere near your old cable prices? Hell, even if you're paying $50/month, is the service not vastly superior? Higher definition, more portable, ad-free, etc..  

What is your ideal cord-cutting scenerio? What about the current offerings and competing services would make you happier? I'm genuinely curious, because over the last 10 to 15  years I've watched my cable/dish bills drop from $100-$200/month for shit service with ever increasing commercials to about $20 for streaming services with the ability to watch just about whatever I want, whenever I want.

cordcutters,"Here is my take: wireless may be fine, but if something is stationary I'm going to wire it to Ethernet. I just don't want excess wireless data being transmitted if I can help it -- and as much as possible save that wireless bandwidth for devices that need it like tablets and phones. 

My Insignia Roku TV had integrated Roku Express, and I purchased a USB 2.0 Ethernet adapter for that TV so I didn't have to use WiFi. Where it is noticeable is when playing back from my Tablo DVR which is also wired to Ethernet. Shows load faster, and scrolling (ff or rw) is quite a bit more responsive compared to when the TV is on wireless. I don't really notice any difference when streaming over the Internet, because my wireless is quite a bit faster than my Internet connection.

My area (like a lot of areas) is super crowded with WiFi routers. I see a list of 20 or more when I scan. No doubt, the 2.4 GHz and likely the 5 GHz bands are super crowded anywhere you go. Adding to it may be a drop in the bucket, but I still would rather not.",1534438552

We don’t use home phones often.. and mainly use it for a throw away number, but it comes out to about 2 or 3 bucks a month.

Also, there is no chance that in 2016 Disney was not already considering their own streaming service. It was definitely a concept behind closed doors at that point.

That means Disney should have either negotiated for a high enough price to not have Star Wars on their streaming platform or just walked away.

But of course if you want ALL sports, you have to get all of them.  There's the rub.  If I like a wide variety of college football.

Another issue many people run into is that their locals aren't on whatever streaming service they are interested in.   I solved this by purchasing a Tablo TV OTA DVR.  The LITE version is $140 at Best Buy.  I pay $50 a year for guide data from them.   That lets me get all my locals from an Antenna and still have a whole house DVR that can record 2 shows at a time (plenty when there are really only about 5 channels on OTA).

Now you pick whatever your favorite streaming service is.  We went with Sling blue because I could add Hallmark channel for my wife but I'm not sure we will keep it.

Maybe they'll start recycling the older 4G gear in as they replace it with 5G in other areas, which wouldn't be terrible. A lot of the cell towers we serve see maybe 10Mbps - 20Mbps of usage.

I imagine it is simply the result of lazy developers who didn't want to put a system in place to determine which feed to use based on a subscriber's location, like all the other OTTs do.

cordcutters,"Wow. I pay $111 for just Internet and phone (and the phone is only like $15 or $20). I have a different cable company though.

Do you have a monthly data cap? If so, you'll want to pay more to increase or eliminate it because streaming several hours of video per day eats up a lot of data.

As for antennas, buy one from a store that allows easy returns. Amplified antennas help reception in some cases... it depends on many factors and you won't know until you try. If you don't receive the channels you expect, return the antenna and try another one.

Any modern router should work with Comcast. Older/worse routers will be limited in their top wifi speed (something like 50Mbps) or not have the newer frequency (5GHz) that newer devices can handle. If your router does both, you stick your older devices on the 2.4Ghz connection. Think of them as multiple pipes, and dividing the traffic makes everything move better. I'd buy anything recommended by [Tom's Hardware](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-wifi-routers,review-2498.html).

Advertisers care and take notice if your viewership is older than 49, let alone 60. My guess is that viewership skews Male; not a prime demo. Add to that the general controversy surrounding cable news in general and potential boycotts and customer complaints, I'd throw my advertsinign money at lifetime and WE if I was an advertiser.

cordcutters,"Using all of them, PSVue stands out.  Hulu is fine, but I tried it before they redid the UI and the live TV access sucked before that but I understand the UI is supposed to be better now.  Hulu was a bit more expensive because DVR with ability to skip commercials is $15, but it includes HULU VOD library.
So if you use Hulu a lot already, the try them out as it’s nice to have it all in one service and live TV is very stable.  But my other choice is Vue as a stand-alone service.
That being said, they all have different channel availability so first figure out what channels you want, then see who offers them, then compare pricing.
DirecTV Now has eastern feeds of “cable” channels and Vue has western (at least in California) which is one detail that affected me (program schedules.)  DTV NOW also has one of the most comprehensive channels offerings for the package price IMO.  But DTV Now is also probably one of the most problematic.

No one is a clear winner.  Compare based on channel offerings and go from there.

YoutubeTV is great but the DVR is usually just VOD (with ads) and they don’t have the channels I want.  Philo is fine with great DVR/VOD but very limited channel selection.  Still if DVR isn’t important and they have your channels, YTTV might be a good choice.",1534962049

N300 is a pretty old router, I have the same modem with 70Mbps Comcast service and have no issues.

Most interference can be overcome by adjusting the channels used for WiFi, out of the box most use channel 6 and most people don't take the time to change it. If you try channel 1 or 11, it should help reduce interference.

This is not true. You cannot skip commercials on Hulu for things on the DVR, only VOD is commercial free if you upgrade. For example, we recorded a baseball game yesterday, tried to watch it today and were forced to watch all commercials. I spoke with a rep and there is no way around this.

I just signed up for a YTTV trial, but now I'm reading they remove your DVR recordings in a day or so and force you to watch VOD with commercials. Although I'm not sure this also applies to sporting events (which are intolerable with commercials). I will test and find out.

These streaming services are shooting themselves in the foot. I'm seriously considering going back to cable to skip all their forced commercial watching baloney.",1535228896

As far as Netflix is concerned, I just got that for my elderly father. The way Netflix bubbles people, and never gives them an actual list of EVERYTHING available has made me stay away from it.

I usually only watch Documentaries anyway. YouTube has provided me with something new to watch on a daily basis for the last few years. Even then I only watch them to help me go to sleep at night.

Video games have taking this 48 year old away from the curse of television. I highly recommend trying some immersive video-games.

cordcutters,"If you really want to go for the minimum, AT&amp;T doesn't count the data you use when watching DirecTV Now on phones and tablets (including tethered). They also give you steep discounts when you add it to certain phone plans. 

So what you can do is tether a Chromecast and an otherwise unused phone to your primary cell phone. Then cast the entire spare phone to the TV and pull up DirecTV Now. You don't even have to pay for service on the tethered phone.

Don't use the cast feature within the app -- that counts against your data. Cast the entire phone and pull up the app. The endpoint as far as DirecTV Now is concerned is the phone not the TV. 

Turn on your hotspot when you come home and you've got a great TV lineup for about $10 a month. 

Samsung Smart TVs can also detect HDHomeRun devices, so if you feed your WiFi with a wireless bridge grabbing WiFi off your phone, you can also watch your local channels without using your phone's Internet connection.

cordcutters,"I said they couldn't pull the copper until recently and had to show the copper network wasn't maintainable.  The FCC changed the rules within the last few years and all telcos now have 'copper retirement' programs.  So the story you recently read aligns exactly with what I wrote.  The wire centers they replaced copper in with fiber were flooded in Sandy.  Verizon has a schedule in place now where they are starting to replace copper completely with fiber in areas they installed FIOS.  Customers can complain all they want and Verizon just has to say we can now do this.  Verizon will save money by doing this - lots of it so it's always been in their favor to do so and now they can.

https://www.lightreading.com/ethernet-ip/new-ip/verizon-saves-60--swapping-copper-for-fiber/d/d-id/715826

What I'm writing is well documented on Fiercetelecom - literally dozens of stories and stories on Ars Technica and DSL Reports complaining that they aren't maintaining their copper networks so they can replace them with copper. The complaint being there is no way to back up fiber power wise to diesel generators that can run forever.  

In order to replace the copper networks telcos have to re engineer all the circuits that won't work on fiber - still plenty of alarms and fax machines require a copper dial tone - along with ancient but still used specialty data circuits which some customers don't want to upgrade because of equipment costs.   The Central Office swicthes installed by Bell in the 70's and 80's were designed to be used for the most part with copper.  All sorts of ancillary equipment has to be installed to make them work with 100% fiber.    So the concept that it is 'simple' to just replace copper with fiber just isn't true.

cordcutters,"If you're watching a live channel, the ads are pretty much the same on every service. The channel itself puts the ad breaks in and the streaming services just pass along the live feed. If you're watching a NFL game on CBS for example, the ad breaks will be the same whether you're watching over an antenna, through a cable/satellite provider or through a streaming service like YoutubeTV/PSVue.

The people who complain about ads on YoutubeTV are talking about the DVR/VOD content. With YTTV you have unlimited space in your cloud DVR, but everything expires 9 months after airing. When you watch a DVR'ed program, you can fast forward through commercial breaks. The catch is that if the channel you recorded a show from uploads a VOD version of the same show/episode, they will usually lock you out of watching the DVR'ed copy and force you to watch the VOD version of the same episode instead. The VOD version has commercials inserted with fast forwarding disabled, so that's what people complain about.

I have YTTV and I don't mind the ads (I used to watch most my stuff on Hulu with ads so its not much different when I'm watching VOD stuff on YTTV).

cordcutters,"Philo has Viacom (and discovery) and 3 streams for $16, and WatchTV has imo the best cheap lineup including Viacom and Turner for $15 but it’s only one stream.

Sling is good for cheap sports and RSSN’s, I think that’s their niche now.  Back when I signed up they were the only option, but they’ve fallen far behind now.

cordcutters,"I think a big part of cord-cutting is about watching less TV. Because let's be honest, we're generally not cutting the internet cord. 

First, I'd do whatever you can to use that business internet connection for personal use. I'm sure you can plug your router into that modem and they will not know or care. It doesn't cost your company anything.

2nd, ditch the cable TV and land-line. Most of your cost is in the TV service. You probably have multiple cell-phones in your house and the land-line is no longer necessary. Just let it go.

3rd, Use your cell phones and something like a chomecast on any TV that's not as 'smart'. Really though, my suggestion is to get used to watching less TV and try to raise your kids that way. Most young kids just want to watch youtube these days anyway.",1534791950
cordcutters,"I'm currently considering the opposite switch. I have YTTV and am considering switching to Hulu Live bc Hulu carries A&amp;E, HGTV, and Lifetime in addition to my local channels which YTTV also has. I know I can get those through Philo (which I have for MTV and a few other channels currently). 

I also think having access to Hulu's programming and catalog of other programs is a huge bonus. 

YTTV's on demand is still depending on what the networks choose to provide. From my trial of Hulu Live for some shows I think they are better as far as sheer amount of on demand content. 

YTTV as a whole has a better DVR (since unlimited is included) and is in generally more reliable as a service as far as buffering goes. Hulu is on pretty much any device though  where YTTV isn't on as many. ",1533834631
cordcutters,"Yep. It just depends on whether or not the teams/leagues/competitions broadcast on ESPN+ are things you *need* to see. As for me, I initially subscribed to watch one pre-World Cup friendly because it was my team playing and I don't miss a match, so $5 for one match was fine. The next month I needed to see the U-19 Euros (I watched about seven matches). This month I need to to watch a few college basketball summer exhibitions, and then it's college football/UEFA Nations League/Serie A followed by college basketball/FA Cup, and so on...

Without knowing what a specific sports fan is interested in watching, I can't sell ESPN+ to them. For me, there's going to be at least one game almost every month that I don't mind paying $5 to see, and anything I want to watch beyond that is gravy.",1534202438
cordcutters,"To add to this... If you're watching from a library of video files with Plex, you probably want a newer / faster computer. Especially if you're downloading stuff.

Basically, not all TV's play nicely with all digital video formats. Video codec and container can be a big deal. What this means practically, is that you either have to figure out exactly what your TV prefers, and then get only vids in that format (difficult, depending on format) or you have to *transcode* them to a useable format.

If you're transcoding, the speed of the process is directly linked to PC speed. You can either convert the entire file ahead of time, which can be annoying, and take the entire length of the file (or more!) on a slow machine....

Or you can try to transcode ""on the fly"" aka ""as you watch."" And that's where comp speed *really* starts to matter! 

On my old ass machine, I can not live transcode anything higher than about 720p / 1mbps, without all kinds of lag and buffering issues. 

 (For the record, my TV is hard wired to PC, and I stream HD online with no prob, so I'm pretty sure it's not the connection speed. A full movie file takes anywhere from 100% to 200% of runtime to pre-order convert, depending on settings. So YMMV)

*EDIT:* For the brand new folks I feel I should add... Some TV brands / models can handle multiple vid formats better than others. For example LG TVs have a good rep for this. I own a Vizio, which I like in many regards... But some video formats it just does not like. And finding solid info online can be a bit confusing...)",1534797855

This is what I do.  HDHR Prime into a Plex server.

No black outs or buffering or ""we're having a problem with this channel please choose another.""  Plus a huge DVR that's limited by the size of the hard drive I want to buy.

Yes, it's ~$60/month instead of $17-35 but I figure that's not a bad price to pay for the flexibility.  It's not for everyone but it is for me...

The commercials can't be skipped and if you change the channel/input while they're on (fire tv stick here), the stream pauses the commercial for you until you return. How considerate.

None of which is guaranteed. 

If you want to cancel, you have to get the equipment returned, then you have to also convince your now former provider that you did actually return the equipment and they can stop charging you for the lease now....

Switching TV providers used to be like a bad breakup. You wouldn't switch to save money just because you didn't want to have to go through all that hell again.

Big Cable refuses to budge on price. If they let customers cherry-pick individual channels (at a reasonable price per channel), then they wouldn't be experiencing an exodus.

If you are so certain that you’re getting rid of cable, just get a better streaming box. Personally I’d recommend a Roku or Apple TV.

150MBPS is $15 more than 60 and we have a couple of PS4’s. I’m OK with that. ",1534081191
cordcutters,"Gotcha, well I understand every market has its quirks.  Cutting is all about customizing to what you want.  I would think that in a city like Philadelphia you should have a lot of good OTA options.  In my household we use a combination of Sling ($25 / month), Netflix, Amazon, and OTA for a grand total of less than $50 / month in addition to the cable service.  We have also used the $15 / month HBO streaming service but once we watched GOT 3 times through there was no use in keeping it.
Part of the appeal of cutting comes from the sense of pride from finding your own way as well as a certain satisfaction from cutting into cable companies' revenues.  If I had been paying Comcast over $200 / month I would love the opportunity to hit them in the pocket while giving them a symbolic finger.",1534098055
cordcutters,"No worries. I liked YouTube TV, Vue, and Hulu with Live TV, but I ended up choosing Fubo for my Rangers. Fubo offers many sports and entertainment channels (news too). You get 30 hours of DVR space, which you can expand to 500 hours for an extra $9.99. You can use your account to sign into TV Everywhere apps like Fox Sports Go and MSG Go. Some network apps have a lot of tv shows and movies on demand (A&amp;E, History, FX Now, etc.). Fubo has on demand content within their app too. The only thing is that they don't have ESPN, which I don't care for anyway. Some people use Philo as a supplemental service to their live tv. You probably won't need it, but it's there ($16). Me and my cousin go half and half on it because Philo allows up to three streams at one time. I have an Apple TV 4K. ",1535731171
cordcutters,"Well sports then are the only thing truly ""live"" in your definition.  And services like Sling, Vue, DirecTV Now, and YouTube TV do provide live sports.  Technically it may be delayed a minute or so compared to if you are actually in the stadium watching the game just because the physical transmission does take time but it's as close as we can get. 

But for produced dramas/comedies and such produced by ABC or the like.  There is a time before they can be ""first aired"" before they would be available on-demand and such.  And advertisers still pay for time.  The advertisers pay more for 8 pm on a Wednesday night than perhaps some other times.  You may watch the show on demand at midnight but certainly if ABC aired the show at midnight, advertisers wouldn't pay as much for that time slot.",1533235221
cordcutters,"RCA VHF/UHF yagi.

Chimney mounted using a compass based on magnetic north as listed in TV Fool.

If you overlay with a topo map, I could move three blocks to the west and that would take me off the geographic region called the Grand Prairie into the foothills of the Ozark Plateau. If I moved roughly that distance to the east, it would get me out of the shadow of a hill that is taller than my antenna which is at roughly 25 ft.

Counting subs, I can pull 10 channels crystal clear and another 11 in and out depending on weather and time of day, friend a half mile to the north a slightly farther away from the transmitters can pull 40+ with an indoor antenna.

The TV Fool maps and all are a useful tool but they don't account for buying a house in what is basically a hole. :)

My father lives 50 miles from the same transmitters and can pull 17 of the channels I get plus 7 more from another city on the back end of an attic antenna because the transmitter is almost exactly 180 degrees from where his antenna is aimed.

A large number of NJ TV stations also broadcast from the WTC.

My guess is that most all stations are now in the WTC.  But apparently WABC, WNET, and WPIX have chosen lower power transmitters (on their lower, similar frequencies).

The guy wires alone would extend to the neighbors and they're already not my biggest fans.  Suffice to say, it's an RF wasteland at my house.

I've tried a bunch of different antennas, from flat ""leaf"" styles to full on ChannelMaster yagis pointed directly at one cluster of towers.  They'll work great...until the wind rustles the leaves a bit and everything turns to hash.  Never mind that Seattle has three different clusters of towers (Queen Anne Hill, East Madison, and Way Over In Issaquah) and I'm physically behind a hill for two of the three so my reception of them is shown on TV Fool as ""2Edge.""

So, earlier this year, I gave it up.  Comcast has a prepaid cable option that's still available if you know how to go find it for $60/month.  Yeah, it's not the cheapest, but I get *all* of the OTA channels--including the myriad subchannels and a bunch of OTAs from cities I'd never hit by antenna, like Bellingham, and CBUT from Vancouver--plus I can finally watch ROOT Sports again and log in to basically every channel with my TV provider creds.

I can see some time in near future it happening and being offered for people to opt for it instead of purchasing 3rd party streaming boxes and going through the grueling effort of deciding which box to get - Apple, Android, Roku, Fire, or just rely on a built in TV smart function. 

If we’d all be honest and get out off our pro user high horses (not personal) we’d reacquaint ourselves with the epiphany that the majority consumer doesn’t know which one to pick or want to pick and unlike a phone it can’t really be explained to them in short (point of sale). Keeping in mind that everybody’s going to be different on which box they’ll enjoy using and it’s experience over another and no one wants to choose wrong for that and the experience can’t be known till usage. Point is for us we know individually what we want and we understand, but for the lame (majority) not so much. 

Traditional cable will be around though till at least this last generation of senior citizens are around. Between now and then I can’t see where traditional cable doesn’t have to go the way of Sling with a App centric box with catered Apps that runs via Ethernet even WiFi. ",1533532303
cordcutters,"The month I did a trial for DTVN, i had the highest data usage I have ever had even compared to extensive binge-watching on Netflix and Hulu. I am sure it is worse with multiple users.  Here are some suggestions. YMMV.

1. Make sure that you completely log out of any apps/channels on any streaming device. (Note that they will update whenever they are on too so you may want to unplug them. Don't shut off the tv while in the app or channel, exit it to the home screen for the device. 

2. Don't watch 4K video. Don't download large files or large game purchases. Not sure if gaming uses alot of data, but my guess is that it probably uses more than you think.

3. Live streaming services use more data than Netflix and probably Hulu. Avoid using them for the rest of the month. Use an antenna, watch DVDs from the library.

4. Don't leave streaming services on if you aren't actually watching them. Don't fall asleep to them. Antenna is a better choice. Remember that streaming music also uses data.

5. Try QoS on your router.

6. Some services do allow you to set the video quality especially on mobile devices. Live streaming services typically don't.

7. Adjust settings for your OS updates, phone updates and for facebook, twitter updates. Anything you can do to minimize how often these happen may help. 

8. If you have TMobile or any service that zero rates a streaming service, now is the time to use them. (Disable wifi first).

9. Use one of the [on demand services with off line viewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/index#wiki_on-demand_services_with_offline_viewing). Use the wifi at your local library or cafe to download onto your tablet or phone. Then watch at home. It is only part of a month...

10. If you watch a lot of YouTube videos, you can adjust the video quality settings for that.

The streaming apps on TVs are flaky and may not offer all the latest features.  Example: Hulu Live on our 2016 Samsung crashes frequently, and Samsung does not have the new Hulu client on TVs that are more than a couple of years old.   I recommend getting a streaming media device, like a Roku, AppleTV, or FireStick.

We also have Amazon Prime (student version, $60/year) but would have that for the 2 day shipping anyway.

Many call it the spiritual successor. Many of the episodes focus on ethical dilemmas that are very relevant today.

We continued with DTVN and it just got worse.  Back to Hulu live again, the guide came out (for the Roku) shortly after.  We also found TitanTV and their guide.

Now we have Hulu Live, Prime (which we would have anyway for the shipping), and Philo.  That combination gives us everything we were looking for.  It'd be nice to have all the channels in one package, but it's not a big deal.  We're saving a little bit over out DTV bill, but now we have much more freedom in what we watch and when we watch it.

Most of the appeal for the Hulu Live for us is the addition of the traditional streaming package and the additional streaming that comes with the live pack.  When we downgraded from the live back to the regular package we noticed LOTS of the shows we had marked to watch were no longer available.  The amount we lost was a good chunk of the deciding factor to reactivate the live package again.  Now that we've gotten used to the weird interface (compared to the others) we're pretty happy with it.

cordcutters,"My general recommendation is to get your home wired for both Comcast and Verizon FiOS, if possible, and learn how to switch between them. You can then switch to whatever service you're not currently on and have the new customer standalone internet promo price for a year or so. Once that promo runs out, switch back to the other provider and get their promo price and just keep following that routine over and over and over. As long as you don't rent any equipment, you'll never have to send anything back. I'm in the greater Philly area as well, and because of this approach, I've only had to pay between $30 and $40ish for standalone internet for the last several years.

The nice thing about using only streaming services as well is that you can easily turn your subscriptions on and off in any given month, depending on what you want to watch that month. For example, if you don't feel like watching the Phillies in the summer, you can turn off whatever subscription that includes NBC Sports Philly and go with something cheaper that doesn't have NBC Sports Philly for a few months. Also, just in case it hasn't already been mentioned, NBC Sports Philly is currently available on Sony Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu Live, and Fubo TV.

I hope this will pressure Tablo to up their game a bit. Tablo is 80 to 90% there for me now.

I love my Tablo but a few improvements are needed:

* Ability to quickly select multiple recordings easily for deletion or protection.

* Zippier interface: Get rid of the lag or offer a faster text only program list.

* My Tablo occasionally glitches on programs, separating them into two recordings. (I think that might just be my network and not necessarily a universal Tablo issue.) 

Bottom line is that I'm getting about 90% of the entertainment happiness I got from Cable and am paying less that $20 a month (Tablo guide plus Netflix) when I was paying $100 a month.

cordcutters,"It is the only way to really tell if you don't need an amplifier and to tell whether the channels are VHF-Hi or not. (I find rabbit ear antennas or winegard flatwave best for most indoor antennas situations because they are better at getting VHF signals.) We can't really give you good advice on what works or doesn't work. We can't tell if you should using an attic or rooftop antenna. Looking at the report would probably help eliminate some of the issues. Knowing which floor the antenna was on is also helpful. 

You said you are in NJ which probably has some hills and valleys and if so, many of your signals may not be line of sight. Tvfool.com will tell you if the signals are two-edge signals or line of sight. A one or two edge signal means that the signals aren't getting to you directly - they are bouncing off something. (Hills, buildings, etc) 

Secondly, it possible that your house has a radiant barrier, metal roof, metal siding, or some other interference. in addition, metal screens, rebar, electronics and some older led bulbs can also cause interference. Sometimes a shielded coax cable can help. Old coax cables should not be used. 

Also note that you need to completely remove (not just unplug) the amplifier  and then re-scan for channels. Each time you move an antenna, you need to rescan for channels. 

In a few cases, as much as I dislike Mohu, sometimes it is not the antenna's fault. Some tuners are just plain awful.  The only way to test that is to use another tv or buy a converter box/tuner from a store with easy returns and use that tuner. ",1534905605

* Avoiding hardware rental fees (typically $10+/month per unit)
* Avoiding commercials (Netflix, ad-free Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO, Showtime, etc)

&gt;Also, routers ""compatible"" with Comcast listed on their website, are not among the ""best routers"" on Cnet, PC Mag, etc.
&gt;
&gt;What's a good router to use with Comcast service? I  plan to rent their router until I can purchase my own.


Be aware that the box you are currently renting from Comcast that you are calling a ""router"" is actually a cablemodem + router all-in-one device.


It's important to know the difference. You can't get Comcast internet service with a standalone router. You'll need either an all-in-one cablemodem+router or to buy each piece separately.


I think most cordcutters prefer to purchase their (cable)modem and router separately, for a few reasons.


If a newer DOCSIS standard is adopted by the cable provider, and the modem you're currently running goes on the list of Legacy devices, then you can change out the modem without having to redo your whole network. Conveniently, there's a secondary market for old-but-not-dead DOCSIS devices.


Maybe the router that you're running doesn't have all of the features you're looking for. Maybe there's a newer wireless standard baked into your laptop that you'd like to take advantage of. You can swap out the router without having to play fuck-fuck games with Comcast.

cordcutters,"The separate internet connection for work seems a bit excessive, but I suppose that depends on the industry you're in and if not using that connection for personal use is a security risk. Most people I know who have employer funded internet use it as their primary personal internet as well.

For TV, are there channels other than Disney Junior that you NEED? There are several streaming live TV options that will save you money over the cost of Spectrum TV, but the channel selection does vary, so if you have must-have channels it'll be easy to weed out ones that don't have those channels. Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, YouTubeTV, Sling TV, and Hulu w/ Live TV are some to look at. 

All of these services work using an app that you will install on a streaming box, so look into what your Smart TV supports. You might need to invest in a Roku/Apple TV/Fire TV. DirecTV now offers a promo where pre-paying for 3-months of service gets you a free Apple TV 4K, which retails for more than the 3 months of service costs.

and mount it to the side of the house for stability. The rings you see have holes for guy wires if there is an issue with sway, and at 40' that would not be a shock. But definitely go with something tall and stable.

I will say this, I worked in the Texas oil fields for some time installing LTE on oil rigs. We used these 10""x10"" flat directional antennas pointed toward our towers. The telescoping pole I linked to you is exactly what we used when the rig site was in a hole (lower elevation than the surrounding terrain) and they worked great.

cordcutters,"We're a family of 4 w/ a 1TB data cap and were on PSVue for years.  It's pretty tricky to avoid hitting a cap with that many people all online and it's not just PSVue.  Netflix and software updates and gaming all take their toll. That said, I think you two will be just fine. It gets a little trickier as the size of the household increases, though. 

If you're still concerned, then there are some things that will help manage your data limit:

1. If you have a wireless phone plan that includes unlimited data, then USE IT! You're paying for it. This takes some of the burden off your home internet.  Only 3 of us are old enough to have phones, but we got on the TMobile One Plus plan back when they had a crazy promotion going on and we have 3 lines of ""unlimited"" (throttled after 50GB/user each month) for a combined total of only $80/mo., taxes included.  We have a rule that there is no connecting to wi-fi in the house.  I estimate we probably conserve about 100GB/mo of our home internet data limit by making sure our phones do everything over LTE.
2. I just installed Windows 10 last night so I thought I'd point out that by default it is set up to use your internet connection as a P2P server to help others download windows updates.  That is a big no-no if you're on a data cap so be sure to turn it off.  We have 4 computers in the home I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10 so that could easily kill our 1TB data cap.  In fact, I also recommend changing the auto-update settings so that it doesn't automatically check/download any updates without you doing it manually. There are a ton of settings in Windows 10 you should probably also turn off if you want to conserve bandwidth.
3. I haven't tried it yet, but there is an open-source router firmware you can flash to certain compatible routers called *Gargoyle* that will allow you to set data quotas for devices.  You can make them daily quotas, you can set times when they just can't connect at all, you can set monthly quotas, etc... If you have a device you're worried about eating up too much data, you can limit it through the router.  Maybe you don't want your Roku/FireTV streaming box to use up more than 400GB in a month -- you can make sure it gets cut off when that happens. Or, you can even set the router to limit the max throughput to the device which will force Youtube/Netflix/Etc... to stream at a lower resolution which will conserve more bandwidth. You could maybe also set up another rule that limits your gaming device to 400GB and then give each of your computers a 75GB/mo limit which will leave 50GB available for emergencies and other less demanding devices to access.  I've heard that you can also upload a custom hosts file to the router that will block, at the router, advertising sites so that when you are on the web you aren't wasting precious bandwidth.",1535738693

Although I must admit YouTube TV's ability to arrange the guide in any order you want is great.   You can even hide channels you know you won't use.   I wish all the services did that.   I don't even currently subscribe to YTTV but I'll give props where it is due and they got that part right!

I don't miss the once per year phone call to renegotiate a lower rate.   I don't miss all the junk fees, taxes, and other below the line fees that caused the price to be far more than quoted.   

We're nearing two and a half years without cable and I truly cannot think of one thing I miss.   I sure love having more money in the bank!   ",1534203972
cordcutters,"IMHO, their biggest mistake was rolling this out with half their channels in one time zone and half in the other. That is just stupid IMHO and seems like just a purely lazy implementation.

The second biggest mistake, or maybe tied for first, is lack of third party support. Sure, I know it is coming (hopefully), but outside of hacks that still don't deliver 100% functionality due to the above timezone issue, the only way to use the service right now officially is live through the native, and kind of crappy, app, which of course requires direct LAN connectivity to the HDHR. They should have worked with these third party companies from the get go so things were ready for release. And maybe actually beta test with customers so they wouldn't have to redo all their website info/FAQ when people started complaining about the issues they found within minutes of release.

And in third place for bad decisions -- the price. At $25, this would be amazing. $30 is probably still fair for all the sports stuff. But $35? That is what most people pay YTTV for and they get many more channels, out of the box functionality across basically everything, and 9-month DVR (yes, I know VOD sucks). Now granted, rumor has it Google is losing money on YTTV even at the $40 price point, so maybe HDHR's $35 is what the minimum sustainable rate is, with some profit, for what they deliver. But competition is getting fierce and while they do offer something no one else does, and I love the idea of roll your own DVR, they are limiting themselves to a niche demographic already, so pricing people out isn't the best idea. And while I know many people love ESPN and sports, I think that they would have been much better to do a Philo-like roll out initially ($20 or so) without the sports stuff and then offered the rest as add-ons.

* Content restrictions that have to be fought out in court. How quickly will some group claim the city is ""sponsoring"" porn, or hate speech, or not punching Nazis, and sue. How often will those groups win? More often than you think ... look at the fights libraries have over books like Huckleberry Finn.
* The same limitations on competition you have now, with the city prohibiting others from providing services because they have to recoup the investment. That leads to lack of innovation and decaying infrastructure. 

There's probably a solution by having the municipality create the infrastructure and then lease access to providers. I understand that is a model used by some European countries, where the ""pipes"" are public and the services coming through the pipes are from private companies.",1535377451

While I'm a fan of many of those shows, many of them significantly differ from each other. I like Mindhunter but not Ozarks. I found End of the F@#*3%R#* World infuriating (*wait was the punctuation intentional or were they scared to swear?*) but Stranger Things enthralling.

It does toss into the Netflix dilemma: There's so much stuff that, without knowing the viewer's tastes, there's a good chance you throw him a show he may not like two or three times and they ""learn"" the algorithm is crap and none of the Netflix shows are worth watching.

cordcutters,"&gt;The lifetime subscription is account based so you can transfer it if you replace/upgrade your Tablo in the future.

That is definitely a nice thing to keep in mind. With Tivo, for example, it's tied to the device.

&gt;There are programs for ripping your recordings from the Tablo, so you can at least archive those onto a Plex/Emby server if you wanted to.

Good to know.  Is there currently a way to easily remove or skip over commercials on your recorded content?  I know Tivo is a piece of cake, and with several HDHR solutions (both free and paid) there are easy ways to get past commercials.

&gt;Image quality is fine, especially if you choose a higher quality option in the settings and 5.1 audio support was recently added, although there are compatibility issues that need to be taken into account if you want to use it.

I read something recently that the high-quality setting is a little wonky.  Especially so w/ a 4-tuner Tablo where one tuner won't record at the same quality as the other 3 if they're all recording simultaneously.  Are you running the Tablo at the highest-quality setting and if so, have you been able to notice any issues at that setting?

&gt;I haven't had any regular network issues. A few minor hiccups but nothing major or repeated.

This is encouraging.  Are you running it over ethernet or wifi?

&gt;They cache all the guide data locally, so if you have a ton of channels like I do, it takes forever for them to sync for the first time. And if you don't open the apps for a week or so, you'll probably be stuck waiting a while for it to load as well.

If that's your biggest gripe, that's really pretty good overall. I doubt I would use the Tablo over my phone all that much anyway.  I barely ever used the Dish Anywhere app the whole time I was with Dish and it was really fast and well-made.

* https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps

What are you using to combine the two antennas? If it is not something like a UHF/VHF combiner you would expect that some channels might cancel out particularly since the antennas are not the same.

WQED is a VHF-high band channel and neither of your antennas have a lot of performance in that band. Also, it is going to relocate to a VHF-low channel in the next few years.

cordcutters,"1. Yes, the length of the cable can affect reception in a situation where reception is an issue. I had two Mofu leaf antennas. The newer one had a much longer cord and pulled in only a couple channels reliably. The older model, with a much shorter cord, pulled in about 10 channels. The two cord lengths couldn't have been much different than 6 and 12 feet because they were both indoor antennas (I don't remember how long they were). 

2.  The phrase 'digital antenna' is just a marketing term. All antennas pull analog and digital signals from the air. What matters is whether you have an old TV that only accepts analog signals, and thus needs a digital converter box to make a digital signal usable on your old TV.

Edit: going by Mohu antennas sold right now, the longer cable may have been as long as 16 feet.

cordcutters,"&gt; But how do I actually install the rooftop antenna?

Most popular choices are:

* if you have an old DirecTV or Dish Network mount, use that
* strap it to your chimney
* mount it on your roof, using an antenna tripod from Amazon, some nails, and some caulk and guy wires
* mount it on your roof using a weighted roof mount for either flat roof or angled (peak) roofs

&gt; Furthermore, how do u get the cables down to the TV? 

Most popular choices are:

* use the existing coaxial from previous satellite dish install
* use the existing coaxial cable from previous cable TV dish install (assuming you're not still using cable Internet)
* look for an extra, unused coaxial run from the side of the house (demarc point) to your wiring panel/basement
* lay down an extra run of coaxial from the antenna to the wiring panel /basement

&gt; Should I just get it professionally installed?

Your call

&amp;nbsp;

And remember to ground both your antenna mast and your coaxial line just before it enters the house. You can find a grounding clamp for the mast at Home Depot/Lowes. For grounding the coaxial, I suggest a TII-212 from Amazon. You can buy the 10 AWG copper ground wires at Home Depot / Lowes or Amazon. For the other end of the grounds, I suggest a Thomas &amp; Betts SC51-CF or SC51-1 on your electric service panel.",1534010944
cordcutters,"It was well over a decade ago that I decided I was through paying for a bunch of crap I didn't watch.  I had always used ReplayTV and Tivo to record my cable shows but I decided to use Tivo and an antenna. Then in 2007 Apple released the first streaming device and I used iTunes to buy the cable show that I was missing.and Tivo for network shows. I then bought a device that hit the market a year later called the Netflix Box by Roku and had all of the entertainment I needed.  I have since gone a little crazy trying every service and device that comes along but to me it is fun to try new things.

My friends and family didn't see it that way at first. Early on they would ask about my finances. They would question my sanity. As if cutting cable was one step away from moving to a cabin and writing a manifesto. But the funny thing is every single one of them has come to me in the past year asking for help cutting the cord.  I help them find a device that fits their needs (Apple, Amazon, Nvidia or Roku), Antennas for OTA if they intend to go that route and streaming services based on their wants and needs.

They are amazed not only by the money they save but by the massive amounts of options available to tailor their own entertainment experience and the sheer amount of entertainment.  I went from shunned to Sherpa.",1533644022
cordcutters,"I live out in the sticks too.  I used [4GAS](https://4gantennashop.com/) for the past year.  Initial outlay was $380.  $85 for the first month of service and $295 for the 4 GAS branded modem/router and 2 YAGI antennas.  Service is $85/month and it is month to month, no contract.    I'm about 6.5 miles from the T-Mobile tower.  We averaged about 500 GB a month (3 kids, in-laws live with us, all our TV is streamed via Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube).  I would average 10-12 MBps down / 8 Mbps up.  I recently switched though for a few reasons.

The biggest issue was that the speed would drop occasionally (1-2 Mbps down) which was alleviated by a modem reboot.  This started to happen more frequently.  You can't port forward using LTE service.  Chrome Remote Desktop though somehow magically worked which would allow me to remote into my home server to reboot the modem as needed to keep the wife and kids happy.  You also can't put their modem/router into bridge mode although I was able to set my Orbi router as the DMZ which it could then handle the firewall and routing fine.

Depending on how impacted the LTE tower is will determine if you get throttled.

ESPN Insider is going away after 20 years: The Disney-owned sports media giant is switching Insider subscribers over to ESPN+, its recently launched premium streaming service.
ESPN has begun notifying Insider subscribers about the change, which takes effect next Tuesday (Aug. 28). With the latest update to the ESPN App (version 6.2), premium digital subscription content will all simply be ESPN+, which will include what has heretofore been ESPN Insider content.
The ESPN+ branding within the app and espn.com will replace ESPN Insider and all content and features will be available in the same subscription. The goal, according to ESPN, is to simplify its digital direct-to-consumer subscription offerings to fans with a single service — while offering even more value in their subscription.

Or try CBS All Access if there is a local CBS affiliate in your area. $5.99 per month. This has a live stream of your local affiliate (just like cable tv). Also includes live streams of CBS News and sports. On demand too.



Otherwise options are live streaming services that include local affiliates: PS Vue (don't need a PS), Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV, DirecTV Now, and Fubo TV. Check each to see what locals are in your area. Each will be different. Prices vary. Some have DVRs too.

I don't know exactly what kind of resolution I'm getting with Directv Now except that it's either on par with, or better than the picture I was getting with Comcast cable. From what I remember during my time with Vue it was similar. I watch a lot of hockey and basketball so we're talking about a lot of fast paced play and I've never noticed any hitches or pixelation during the action.

cordcutters,"No, I think they'll keep selling the movies, but I'm betting they'll make it harder by limiting the retailers who sell them, and/or more expensive to purchase them outright. I mean The Lion King is 24 years old and they still want $19.99+ for it. I love that movie, but not $19.99+ worth. I'm thinking that cost is just going to go up over time.

And then thinking about all the VHS copies, DVD copies and now Blu-Ray and digital copies they've probably sold of that movie... sheer profit. So no, I don't think they'll stop selling them.

But they will probably make it sound much more affordable to just subscribe. By my calculations there's 20 MCU movies already, multiply by $19.99 each = $399.80. I can't remember if they've teased any pricing, but I'm assuming they're going to go somewhere between Netflix and HBO in cost because they know they can milk parents like they have for generations. If they price their service on the higher side, around $10/month, you'd pay for all those movies in just over 3 years. If they start at $15/month, that's 2 years and change. ",1534294649

I live in a great town, where every penny of my tax money is spent well, with an amazing school system, well-maintained roads, and (at least as far as I can tell) very little overhead/waste.  We (residents) pretty much unanimously vote through every tax levy if it makes even the slightest amount of sense, because we can SEE that the money is being spent properly.  

We went to city-managed electric service a number of years ago, and a city-negotiated trash collection rate.  For electrical, we pay the city, and they pay whichever service provider they've negotiated with (short-term contracts), and we all can reap the benefits of any solar/wind power buy-back from anything set up on the school campuses or public land.  

We also already had a contractor come in and run fiber for the downtown strip of businesses, and they've been happy with it over the past year.  I'm not sure what their costs/plans look like though.

&gt; Santa Clara Fire paid Verizon for &amp;quot;Unlimited&amp;quot; data but suffered from heavy throttling until the department paid Verizon more, according to Bowden&amp;#039;s declaration and emails between the fire department and Verizon that were submitted as evidence.

&gt; &amp;quot;In the midst of our response to the Mendocino Complex Fire, County Fire discovered the data connection for OES 5262 was being throttled by Verizon, and data rates had been reduced to 1/200, or less, than the previous speeds,&amp;quot; Bowden wrote.

&gt; &amp;quot;Verizon representatives confirmed the throttling, but rather than restoring us to an essential data transfer speed, they indicated that County Fire would have to switch to a new data plan at more than twice the cost, and they would only remove throttling after we contacted the Department that handles billing and switched to the new data plan,&amp;quot; Bowden wrote.

I preferred and stuck to the HDHR since I also wanted to build my own PVR, but that's a different more complicated story. The HDHR requires a hardline connected to your router, which is a limitation for some.

Looking at the TVfool report, if you are getting the 6 channels from the south using an indoor antenna, it's not likely that adding an amplifier will do anything for any other channels.

I went back and forth between getting an amplifier or not, and I finally bit the bullet and put in an amplified splitter which significantly improved the signal to the TV directly but did filter out a few from the HDHR.

It should have an on demand section, a live events section, and a ppv section. After the live event airs, it would be accessible to watch in the on demand library. It would eliminate the need for recording which eventually will be considered old tech. As for ads... fuck em let me pay for a premium experience. Maybe have different tiers (a lower price for ads in your content, a higher price for no ads.) I know it will never happen because it's too perfect, but damn, I would pay so much for a service like this.",1535037036
cordcutters,"if your antenna can't pick up the signal an amplifier won't do anything.  Think of it as any number multiplied times zero.  It doesn't matter how big that any number is, the out come will always be zero. 

That being said, when an antenna has a built in amplifier it gets much worse signal then an antenna without an amplifier until the amplifier is turned on, as the amplifier itself causes signal loss when not on.

I wouldn't buy the antenna you linked to with the built in amplifier.  as there is not much you can do with it if it does not work well. 

I would buy an amplifier that plugs into your current antenna, and try that first.  Those can be had for less then $10.  

If that's not satisfactory, I would get another type of antenna with a different design, maybe directional pointed toward the weak area, and using a spliter as a combiner, combine the two antennas, and then if that's not satisfactory add in the amplifier after the spliter/combiner so it amplifys both antennas together equally.  What i'm suggesting is almost a beefier modern day type rabbit ears with the loop antenna from the 80's, as that was actually two different antennas a VHF (rabbit ears) and a UHF (loop) combined into one for picking up both signals.  Make sure the length of the wires going to the splitter/combiner are the same length.

Basically, If you have a little bit of patience slow internet is fine, and most of today’s websites are designed to adapt to varying internet speeds, like being able to choose what quality/resolution you want your YouTube video to play at. Big files, like high quality/resolution (hd/4K) video and pictures take more time to download. So choosing what speed works for you depends on your interests/habits ie what sites you visit. If all you do is browse reddit, slow internet like 1-10mbps would be good enough albeit pictures might load slower, and video from sites like YouTube and Netflix will be played at lower quality for longer as it buffers. But if you watch live hd video from sites like slingtv or twitch you will want 25+mbps so you can watch 720/1080/4K, or if you download huge files like digital video games for Xbox/ps4/Steam you will want as much mbps you can get to be able to play asap.",1535440721

cordcutters,"I recently bought the Roku Stick+ and have been very satisfied with it. I don't have an Ultra, so I can't really compare the two directly, but I can say the Stick+ is as good as any Roku I've had (and I've long been satisfied with Roku hardware).

At this point I have a Roku 3 (2015) downstairs attached to my modem via ethernet and, while it works perfectly well, it is not faster than the Stick+ that I recently purchased and have upstairs from the same modem in a bedroom. I was hesitant to get the Stick+ because when I had the original Roku Stick (2014, I think), it was a huge disappointment that simply wasn't good enough to rely on instead of one of the boxes. However, I took the plunge on the Stick+ recently when all Rokus were on sale and it was a good call.

Regarding load times, the only difference between the Stick+ and the Roku 3 is that when I first turn the TV on the Stick+ has to essentially restart since it draws power from my TV via the USB port, but that takes a matter of seconds (\~10, I'm guessing). At that point there's no difference between load times between it and the box when it comes to opening a channel/app or starting a show. This includes when I'm watching live YouTube TV or a live sporting event via various apps.

If the Stick+ is plugged into an outlet then it should stay on like a box does, which would prevent the initial restart load each time the TV is powered on. Also, my Stick+ didn't fit into the space next to my HDMI ports and the Stick+ doesn't come with the HDMI extender that Roku used to include with its previous Sticks. Fortunately, I still had the HDMI extender that came with my older, disappointing Stick and Roku will send you one for free if you fill out a form on the website (serial number required).

cordcutters,"You have a handful of choices for getting TV programming:

- Antenna: Unless you live in a very remote area or are unable to mount an exterior antenna (apartment, etc) you will probably get dozens of broadcast channels including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CW, etc.  All it costs is one-time purchase of an antenna for $100 or less.

- OTT streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime. A single service runs about $10-15 per month. Hulu is best for getting many programs the day after they air “live”. Shows may take a year to reach Netflix or Prime.

- Buy season passes to specific shows on iTunes, Amazon, etc. Buying a single show will cost around $20-30 and you won’t get the episodes until the morning after the “live” airing. But with this approach you permanently own the shows and can re-play them at will.  It’s tends to only be cost-effective if there are just a small number of programs you would buy. 

- Network apps: Each network has its own apps that run on Apple TV, Roku and other streaming boxes. But they all have different philosophies on what they offer for free. Services like Crackle and Comet TV provide a lot of older, ad-supported content free. Some broadcast apps will give you a couple recent episodes (with commercials) free. But you typically need an active cable/sat/streaming subscription to unlock most content.

- Live TV streaming providers like YouTube TV, PlayStation Vue, Directv Now, Hulu Live, etc. This is like traditional cable, but streamed over the internet. It’s where things get complicated for you because there are a number of live services, all with different channel lineups (pay attention to local networks carried by each if that’s important to you), prices, interfaces, etc. If you want to watch a lot of sports or cable news, this is really the only option. The most entry level package from Sling will cost $25 per month with no DVR while most others are in the $40-45 range. 

Make a list of your must-have channels and programs and start working thru these options to see if there is a most cost effective way of getting it. ",1534082306

I realize it is anecdotal, but that is some 50+ friends I have personally asked over the last couple of years because I am really boring person with boring conversation.

cordcutters,"A first question is what set ups you are willing to use. Do you want to stay with an indoor antenna, is an attic antenna an option, and would you be willing to work with an outside or rooftop setup? Your TV fool report looks good in terms of range for the local channels, though the aspect of the report covering VHF stations would be helpful in analyzing it. It may be that if you have dense tree coverage a roof mounted antenna to gain some height would be advantageous. 

The second would be what exactly do you mean by ""doesn't work"" in regards to the current window antenna? Does it get any reception for any channels, or does it fail to receive any signals? Do times of day make a difference (any slight improvements in the evenings per chance)? If you have the model of the indoor antenna that would also be helpful",1535229405

ESPN+ (added 4/11/2018), PS Vue,  Sling TV and You Tube TV are all available.  The streaming services that are still NOT available are Amazon Prime (can be sideloaded), DirectTV (can be sideloaded), Netflix (can be sideloaded) and Philo.

My thread at https://www.avsforum.com/forum/39-networking-media-servers-content-streaming/2965042-channel-master-stream-ota-streaming-channels.html has details on side loading these channels and the updates they have had. 

The DVR+ did not have any of the streaming services (they had CMTV Internet streams but they were horrible), but did have SlingTV for a while (it is deprecated but may still be active; I don't have it). 

Still, it's not a ""single box"" solution for people until they get Prime and Netflix. CM is waiting for validation from those providers, but I don't know what the hold up is. If you're going to use it with a Roku then yeah, it's a good buy.

cordcutters,"Some people assume they need an omni-directional antenna when they don't. First, you can always mount more than 1 directional antenna. Second, you may be surprised what signals you can pick up from a high-quality directional antenna that isn't even pointed in the right direction to get those signals.

The thing about omnidirectional antennas is that they collect a lot of signals, but not very strongly and they're also going to pick up a lot of signals you don't want.  They are more prone to several issues that cause ghosting. So, they're really not an ideal type of antenna. That may be why you're already assuming you might need a pre-amp b/c you already realize you're going to have weaker signals feeding your coax. Omnis can work and they're common in RV applications, but they're not as good as a quality directional antenna.

Personally, I would first try a directional high-gain antenna pointed at the majority of the stations and I wouldn't even think about a pre-amp until everything else failed and you don't have to buy an antenna that has one already in it you can always ad one in-line later if needed. You may be surprised at what you'll pick up with a good directional antenna. I was shocked to run a channel scan and find out I was getting ALL of the channels that were behind and to the side of my roof-mounted directional antenna at nearly full-strength! [I got the RCA Yagi](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Compact-Outdoor-Antenna-Range/dp/B0024R4B5C).

Once you've tried a directional antenna, then, if there are still a few more off in another direction that you need to grab, just buy another directional antenna and mount it to the same mast, but point it the other direction toward the other stations.  Then all you have to do is take a bi-directional 2-way splitter (also called a combiner) and install it backwards so that the coax from each antenna is going into each of the ""out"" ports and the main trunk to your home is going out of the ""in"" port.  When you install the antennas on the mast, just try to keep about 4' between them so that one is 4ft higher than the other.",1535505465

I read a lot on Reddit about frequent outtages but so far it's been really good*  There's also PSVUE as well and I don't think it's worth it at all. Out of all the services this one had the worst UI so I did not continue with my trial.,1533305157
cordcutters,"Hmm. With the streaming service, the occasional movie as well - Amazon usually has a better selection of movies than Netflix and Hulu imo. It has a few good shows too (The Expanse, Man in the High Castle, Vikings, etc.).

I like shopping on Amazon too, as long as the price for what I'm buying is similar to brick and mortar store prices. Need to buy a birthday gift? Instead of physically browsing the store, you can browse from the comfort of your own home and get that task done so you don't forget later. Need a Halloween costume or some niche item like small car part? Easily find it and throw it in your cart, you'll get it in 2-days.

And instead of having to find something physically, you can easily search and find it on Amazon, but that applies to anything online really. It's just more convenient than going to the store, looking for it, and risking the store not even having the item. Additionally, as far as general online shopping goes, I love the fact that there are customer reviews. Plain and simple. Customers will tell you whether an item is great or shitty and they'll even post helpful pictures in the reviews. 

Finally, I was 100% getting more than my money's worth with the 20% pre-order discount for video games. Sadly this discount changed yesterday, but it was a great perk while it lasted.

I think Amazon Prime members get some music benefit from Amazon too or something, but I use Spotify so that's irrelevant to me. There are other benefits that I don't use (like Amazon drive) and some that I probably don't even know about, but others might find them useful.",1535599307
cordcutters,"I can't speak to Locast and how they are doing this, but I serve on the board of a government affiliated television translator district in a rural area.

While we don't have to have agreements with the broadcasters we retransmit, in most cases we do.  We are in a unique position of kinda being on the border between 3 DMAs (markets), and the DMA we are located in is in a neighboring state (UT), but we also carry channels from in state DMAs (NV) as well.

The agreements really arn't that involved, it's mostly so the stations can a. inform us when they may have planned maintinece (happening a bit right now due to TV repack) or if they get a call from someone in our area complaining about their tv signal so we can investigate and b. so they can count our viewers in their viewership numbers for ad sales.  We carry in market feeds for CBS, ABC, and NBC, then carry out of market (but in state) feeds for CBS, ABC, Fox, and PBS.  The in market stations have the right to require us to stop broadcasting a duplicate feed (the in market CBS station could ask us not to broadcast the out of market in state CBS station), but except with the case of our in market NBC affiliate, none of them care.  The \[url=[https://elkodaily.com/news/local/nbc-to-pull-kenv-affiliation/article\_db64225d-d9c7-5119-bc93-d55dae621890.html](https://elkodaily.com/news/local/nbc-to-pull-kenv-affiliation/article_db64225d-d9c7-5119-bc93-d55dae621890.html)\]neighboring county in the same DMA recently had issues\[/url\] with the in market NBC affiliate because they didn't carry them, but had an agreement with a out of market NBC affiliate to provide programming and they added a local news segment and had a class A license.  

&amp;#x200B;

The translator statue they refferenced refers to licensed over the air translator stations, and doesn't specify anything about internet rebroadcasts.  My guess it this is going to go to court.  If Locast can win the case, it could be game changing, but going up against the big broadcast corps odds are they will get bled dry and be out of business before it ever goes to court.",1535140988

cordcutters,"Of these three, I only have Hulu. I do sometimes subscribe to CBS All Access and I use Hoopla Digital etc.

Regarding why:

1. I didn't use Amazon Prime video much because frequently only one or two seasons of a tv show was available. I rarely watch movies. The price increase and the extra unwanted stuff (NFL and Twitch) made it less affordable. I typically didn't get Amazon Prime shipping in two days after an item shipped. (And the minimum is currently $25 so not too bad.)

2. Hulu has a single stream HD plan for $7.99 (currently $5.99 for me) and I don't really care that much about ads or not since I already have ads on OTA anyway. It is nice when no ads is available but I don't feel like spending extra on it. I really didn't want to pay for an extra stream just to get HD and Netflix had dropped the shows I had been watching on catch up half way through the shows so then I had to turn to Hulu or Amazon to watch the end of the series. Secondly with Hulu, I generally don't have to wait a year. 

I strongly prefer on demand to Live Tv so even when i use CBS All Access, I don't watch live. So for me, cable tv with its equipment rental, horrible remotes, guides with ads, lousy closed captioning, lack of decent on demand, pricey plans, taxes and other fees is simply that similar to the streaming services that i use.

cordcutters,"I'm on my 3rd atenna. I initially bought the largest they make, it's like 12 feet long, 100 mile and picked up 12 stations. I then tried out a really small 150 mile antenna, it's only like 12 inches long and picked up 21 stations. It also had a built in rotator however there is only 1 specific direction where I can pick up anything which is SW and is where most of the stations are from so I don't need a rotator as I know where the sweet spot is. My new antenna is the 8 bowtie DBE or something like that. It picks up 22 stations. The height from ground to antenna is around 25 feet, i can't go any higher. Going bigger doesn't seem to do any justice and the bow tie is one of the larger modern antennas anyone makes. 

The bottom line issue is the fact that the stations are 49 and 68 miles away. The path facing the stations is also blocked by a power sub station and an entire University with many 6 story buildings all within a mile of my house in that direction....not to mention all trees, houses and whatever else is along that 69 mile pathway.

So the stations are going to be weak no matter what. Using 2 amplifiers has so far been the only real success I've had in getting these stations to come in. I just need to stabilize them and so if things like Thermal fading, etc that others have mentioned are a factor then all I can really do further is boost the signals more. I tried using 2 antennas using the windguard UHF/VHF separator but didn't work at all. The only thing that seems to work at this point has been amplification. So I might try a 3rd one just to see how it does.",1533161490

Some of the cloud DVR’s that steaming services offer are OK.  But none offer the reliability or freedom to record whatever I want and keep it for as long as want (hard drive capacity being the only limiting factor, but even then external drives can solve that problem to an extent)",1534267884
cordcutters,"AT&amp;T pulls this bs alot!!! My opinion is to go to contact your local news stations and explain your situation to them. Most major news networks like NBC,ABC, etc. have consumer instigations and deal with these huge companies frequently. They usually get things resolved for you, think of them as a lawyer but instead of requesting money for their services they want to interview you for their consumer reports segment or whatever they call it which they air on live tv. 
I live in the Chicago, Illinois and I see these news story's all of the time. 

https://www.nbcchicago.com/consumer-form/

That is a link to one of chicago's news station's complaint forms. I know it is unlikely that you live in this area but it can give you something to lookout for on their websites, but you can always call them too!!!

cordcutters,"Just saw your edit. I like DTVN moreso than other services because of the stream quality. UI isn't as bad as Hulu and I haven't experienced that many issues with the DVR. Yes, Vue has some problems as well. 

No I do not prefer cable boxes. They're antiquated pieces of garbage. I use an Apple TV, and Chromecast that's built into my TV for streaming purposes. Hulu for what they offer is pretty pricey despite being a beta still. I experienced constant buffering and made numerous calls to support. They told me my internet speeds were causing the issues. I have the gigabit plan through xfinity. Use an Ethernet connection for my ATV. For the amount I was spending monthly on Hulu I didn't buy what they had to say and decided to look elsewhere. They even offered two months of service for free just to keep me satisfied. 

YTTV for me is the best out there. We may not agree on which services are good and bad, but having more options and competition doesn't hurt anyone. That's why I always recommend giving the free trials a go. You have to come to your own conclusions. ��",1534783162
cordcutters,"Get an antenna for sports and local affiliates. 

Tv and sports rights are not cheap and so most content is available by a subscription or ad supported service. You can also buy episodes from Google Play and Amazon and thus get only what you want to watch. 

Try these legal [free services](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/index#wiki_2._streaming_content) in our Starter Guide. They are either ad supported or in the case of Hoopla Digital or Kanopy, provided by your local library. (A few also have Acorn TV too). 

You can also borrow DVDs from your public library for free. Use inter-library loan to get the best selection.  

MLB offers free games of the week. [See schedule here](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/2018/08/27). They also have [free games on Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/978351710820220929) and [Facebook if you have a Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/MLBLiveGames/). I believe hockey does too. 

You will be able to watch the Superbowl and the playoffs for free on CBS's website or sports app. Otherwise, except for an antenna, NFL won't be free. Some college football is on either Twitter, Facebook or I think PlutoTV and is free. Some college football teams provide live streams on their websites but usually not the top teams. However, typically they do offer a free audio stream. ",1535384217

Originally looked into an antenna for the local networks, discovered there were a bunch of sub-channels which put that project into high-gear (getting about 30 channels not counting shopping and religious).  Plex comes out with DVR, get a HDHomerun tuner so we can record shows off of OTA.

Only thing is having to store the discs, I have boxes and boxes on shelves in the garage.

Perhaps. If you are at all handy you should be able to do it. There is some discussion here:

* http://otadtv.com/installation/index.html

Some comments about the stuff at the proceeding link:

1. You don't need quad shield cable for OTA.
2. If you use tie-wraps don't pull them tight as that will deform the soft cable. Multiple wraps of black electrical tape are often used to attach cables to a mast.
3. There is no point in doing the ""Common Installation"" (Fig 1) these days.

cordcutters,"Generally you will save over the course of 1-2 years if you buy your own. Your Time Capsule is still viable, provided it will cover the living space. So, you could buy a DOCSIS 3.0 modem and keep the savings.

Chances are a few things will change in the next few years, in which case you might want to go as cheap as possible now and upgrade later. These changes are 5G Fixed wireless, 802.11ax, and DOCSIS 3.1. 5G Fixed Wireless is likely to offer 1Gbps + service at costs less than most services today, why? Because it is relatively inexpensive to put up a radio for every 10-20 homes than to run Fibre or copper to each. 802.11ax WiFi will be faster, avoid conflicts (with neighboring networks), and should start to appear this year or early next. And cable companies are likely to answer competition from wireless carriers 5G service with faster copper connections (DOCSIS 3.1).

DOCSIS 3.1 modems are in the market already, but are a bit expensive and perhaps overkill given current service levels. If you decide to go 5GFW, a new modem\\router would be needed, but if you think Comcast service for 5+ years is in the cards, might be worth it to buy DOCSIS 3.1 for the future.

If your Time Capsule is the tall cylinder model, it offers 802.11ac which is still among the fastest WiFi on the market. If it is an older model, maybe consider an AC model, but again, consider limiting the spend given the next wave looming.

Comcast has lists of compatible modems on the website, they will even list ones that will meet the service level you are paying for. Generally, Motorola\\Arris, or Netgear are the most common modems, and some units have WiFi routers built in. Separate is nice in that if one unit fails, replacing is less costly, but comes with the price of having to maintain 2 devices. Again, if the Apple router is viable, save the money now.",1533654514

If you'd want to future proof for speed I'd recommend going this way, but if not then you can get whatever.

The only reason I might recommend getting your own separate router is full control and less chance of potential infiltration. I'm not saying Verizon ever *would*, but they have backdoors into their own hardware for diagnostics and what not. With your own router you at least control everything once it's in your own house.

For your last question: It depends on your Fios ONT- it should have both coax and ethernet lines and it can be your choice for which one is plugged in. I think up to 100 or 150Mb it can use the coax line but anything higher than 150Mb requires ethernet. If you have an ONT inside the house this is easy, but if yours is outside then they might have to run a new ethernet cable from the outside ONT into your house if you want to just use that. **BUT, if you have to use the coax line you will have to use the Verizon router as a ""modem"", and set it to gateway mode and setup your own router behind that.** I'd skip that and just use the ethernet line if I were you and you have the option.",1534185531

cordcutters,"This feels like satellite all over again. What age groups are these plans targeting? Is this mostly the generation x and older crowd? I don't know anyone younger than 35 paying for any tv package, whether through cable, satellite, or the internet, that is $50 / month or more. I don't even know anyone younger than 35 that is willing to pay for commercials.

I guess it is nice to have more choices but at best this seems to be shifting cable via coax to cable via the internet. Is it just a convenience thing? Is it just ""well paying $70 / mo is better than paying $140 / mo""?",1535552842
cordcutters,"Here is my response to that, with an addendum.

I'm not sure you're taking into account the fact that the bulk of the world's population exists within a certain band of latitudes, so the satellites could be clustered in those latitudes, increasing available bandwidth within that region. I also wonder if they might be able to cluster satellites longitudinally, since demand for internet service naturally waxes and wanes throughout the day cycle.

SpaceX's service would also not be the only ISP. There are other satellite systems planned, and all the existing terrestrial infrastructure would still exist. So, I don't think it's safe to assume that the entire population would be using SpaceX's service. Simply having it available as an option would create competition and drive down the prices of terrestrial services accordingly.",1534268434
cordcutters,"Many people will incorrectly tell you that your modem supports higher bandwidth than that. What they've failed to look into is how most American cable broadband providers provision the channel usage. 

It doesn't matter what these modems claim to support, if your ISP doesn't support those speeds via whatever number download /upload channels the modem has. The SB6121 and SB6141 were great recommendations for years. However if you want to get 150Mbps, 200Mbps or 300Mbps service in the US via cable, you need something newer. 

For a new modem, you should upgrade to the [SB6183](https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-SURFboard-SB6183-Docsis-Packaging/dp/B00MA5U1FW). With this you'll be set for many more years. 

For routers or access points... That's much more complicated and depends on your home. How much are you willing to spend too?",1535216439
cordcutters,"Sling is 720p30fps or 720p60 depending on the channel. The quality is about on the level of most cable systems as most cable systems send out a compressed signal and not the raw video they receive from the channel initially. I've never used Cox, so I couldn't tell you what their video quality is like.

If you're more towards the videophile end, and you want the best quality, DirecTV Now and YouTube TV are better options. I feel like the post below from /r/slingtv is a good comparison. As you'll see in the screenshot, DTVN is using more than double the bandwidth that Sling uses. Keep in mind, though, that a good chunk of that data is because DTVN is doing the upscaling to 1080p that your TV would normally do as no cable channels are broadcast higher than 720p/1080i. That alone accounts for a huge chunk of the extra bandwidth used.

Personally, I'm fine with the video quality. The thing that annoys me about all of these services is that none of them offer 5.1 sound on their channels.

cordcutters,"All the ""WiFi is plenty fast you'll never see a difference"" answers are driving me nuts.  There's inherent flaws to this thinking.  


Yes, the speeds are fine for streaming ....... assuming that  that is the only device you have operating on the network at the time.  


Remember that the bandwidth is shared among all devices.  How many of us only have one device on our wifi?  Sure some of us are single bachelors living on our own, but the majority probably have families and/or roommates.    


Here's where it gets fun.  Due to the nature of TCP, EVERY packet needs an ACK return.  There will be tens of thousands of these ACK's during a 90 minute movie.  If you have two people streaming over you wifi at once, you're going to get transmission collisions which results in... packet collisions, during the ACK.  When this happens, each device has to send the ACK again.  If they take too long sending the ACK, the packet will get re-transmitted from the source again with the assumption the packet was lost in transmission.  The more devices you have running at once, the more often this will happen, the more bandwidth is taken in just maintaining data integrity.  Therefore, four devices running on 5Ghz (600 Mb/s) 802.11n don't get 150MB/s each, chances are they will get less than 100 Mb/s each even if they're all close to the router.  Add in a few people playing video games, neighbors close by with their own Wifi,  and you have a recipe for tons of lag.  


If you want your wifi network to work well, the best thing you can do for it, is make sure anything that doesn't absolutely require wifi, is hard wired instead.  A large TV is the epitome of something that should be hard wired.  Save your WiFi bandwidth, hardwire that son of a gun, let the wife and kid happily stream away on their tablets as you soak up some HBO Go on the big screen.",1533143802

cordcutters,"Only item that does surge protection is not mentioned - earth ground.  Wall receptacle safety grounds do nothing to protect hardware.  An in-line coax protector does nothing for protection if not connected low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point earth ground.  Plug-in protectors can make surge damage easier.

Damage from a surge is directly traceable to human mistakes.  Apparently plenty were made.  Some are listed above.

Lightning is not capricious as so many only assume - because so many did not even know of the so many mistakes listed in that first paragraph.

Lightning blew right through a protector?  That classic fable is promoted by the naive to the uneducated.  Nothing 'blocks' a surge.  Anyone (anything) that tries to is drinking the kool-aid.  Do you really think an in-line protector will block what three miles of sky cannot? Do you really believe hundreds or thousand (near zero) joules in a magic plug-in strip does anything useful for surges (that can be hundreds of thousands of joules)? Protection from direct lightning strikes is routine in every town.  Your telco CO suffers about 100 surges with each storm.  Ecery town still has phone service during and four days after every storm.  Simple protection is that effective.  They don't foolishly try to block a surge.  They do not waste money on adjacent, plug-in magic boxes.  And do not listen to the so many manipulated naive who claim nothing can avert lightning damage.

A cited cordcutter.com text only introduces ""why it is important to ground an outdoor  antenna"".  Apparently the installation even violated those simple concepts.

Effective protection always answers this question.  Where do hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate.  Once a surge is anywhere inside a structure, then what only remains is is robust protection already inside appliances.  And that can be compromised is a plug-in protector is anywhere nearby.  If a surge is so massive as to even blow through best protection inside appliances, then a human has made some serious mistakes (some already listed).  

A protector is only as effective as its low impedance, hardwire (ie not inside metallic conduit, no sharp wire bends, etc) connection to and quality of single point earth ground.  All other grounds (wall receptacle, digital, virtual, chassis, analog, floating, anti-static, etc) are irrelevant.  But myths often educate the scammed to increase profits.

Not listed is single point earth ground, each dedicated and low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) hardwire connection to that ground, and an always essential 'whole house' protector.

Hulu Live has the same sports content, but you can save some money with Hulu Live (which includes all Hulu content) if you'd subscribe separately to Hulu in addition to a live service.

PS Vue has NFL Network and Redzone, but many areas seem to lack local channels. You'll need to see what it has in your area. While the big carrot for many sports fans is NFL Network/Redzone, with Redzone your package will be about $55/mo. There's too much NFL content on sports TV to begin with, so I can do without them. Vue also has NHL Network, but I get my local team via my regional channels.

FuboTV is pretty good, but I only recommend it for someone who doesn't need the ESPN channels. It's good for soccer and has local regional sports channels.

Sling and DirecTV Now I didn't like much at all. Sling was clunky and unreliable for me over a trial period.

FYI, the current implementation of the guide on the Roku is due to a Roku/dev limitation of BrightScript (even though many prefer that orientation). If Sony was going that direction universally, the PS4 / website would already reflect that as well.

The above makes my initial point, that objectively, the UI for apps on Roku are usually limited and missing features compared to other boxes, and are just plain different in many cases. Again, this is due to a limitation of the Roku dev language, and while you happen to prefer the Vue UI due to this limitation, it is still a limitation nonetheless.

cordcutters,"When I was a bachelor (back in 2004), I was subscribed to Comcast internet.  I have them again now, but that is because I am married and living in a different place.  Anyway, back then, my connection constantly dropped and any calls to them resulted in a ""it must be a problem at your end"".  

At the time, my phone provider, Verizon, was offering DSL for much cheaper than Comcast's internet.  For a month, I kept paying Comcast for internet, while I tried out the DSL.  The DSL service had no dropped connections and noticeably faster speed than Comcast.  So, after a month, I called Comcast to cancel their internet.

Like many others, the response I received from Comcast when I tried to cancel their internet was horrendous.  It was like trying to break up with someone.  Even after explaining that I had already switched to DSL and was happy with it, they insisted that their internet was better and I should switch back.  When I told the guy (on the phone) that I would not switch back and I wanted the internet service cancelled, he asked me why.  I (again) told him that I had switched to DSL and no longer required their internet.  He told me (exact quote), ""that is not a good reason.""

His statement, ""that is not a good reason"" stunned me, so I asked him to please repeat what he said.    At that point, I had many years of working in Customer Service under my belt.  So, I always try to be cordial and usually up-beat when talking to others in Customer Service.  When he replied, ""that is not a good reason to cancel your service with us,"" I could feel the anger start to boil up.  I told him, ""that is the only reason I am giving you.  Either you cancel now, or let me speak to your manager.""  He cancelled it after that and I made him give me a confirmation number, so I could confirm that it was cancelled.

So no, they don't always meet your needs.",1533655766
cordcutters,"I've been a Hulu+ subscriber since long before I cut the cord.  I have never used their Live TV service since the overlap between the content they offer vs the content that I wanted allowed me to immediately eliminate them from consideration when I was making my plans.  (I do have HBO through Hulu which allows me to watch live channels so I don't know if that's different than the standard Live TV interface.  I'm betting it's the same)  I have to say though, unless the interface for Live TV is drastically different from regular Hulu Plus, it's the worst I've ever seen by far.  YTTV is also the my favorite by far so that's an easy win for YTTV.  

My recommendation is to start a trial for each to see which you like better.  When I first cut the cord I did trials of DTVNOW, SlingTV, and YTTV as they best met my needs.  Didn't take long to choose YTTV as my favorite and then when Philo came around it made the perfect compliment.  

For reference on the YTTV VOD debacle:  YTTV has always had a policy where the networks could force VOD over DVR when it was available.  You can skip commercials during your DVR recordings but not VOD (pretty standard).  A few months ago it seemed to get much worse, sometimes happening within a day (or hours) where before it usually seemed to take several.  This became especially obvious when they allowed the option to choose a recording and more often than not you could see your DVR recording but not actually play it (complete with disclaimer that the network had disallowed it). This seems to have softened up some recently, most noticeably with Fox, but is still present.  This forced VOD also seems to expire as I've played catch up at times and only had to watch the VOD versions of some episodes.  Personally I find it an annoyance but only a minor one.  I've complained to them about it, as has everyone else I'm sure, but for me the service has so many other advantages over the others that it's barely a blip on my radar.  They are constantly evolving the service and at this point have implemented pretty much all of the most requested features as far as I know.  ",1535138628

If you are within 30-40 miles of the broadcast towers and can mount an antenna high outside your home, you will probably get a couple dozen channels for less than $100. If you want to RECORD programming for later viewing, that’s where things get complicated.

Next cheapest is fuboTV at $45/mo, gets you everything but HBO, though Univision and Telemundo availability might vary by region. Includes a 30 hour Cloud DVR ~~with no ad skipping~~. Extra $10/mo gets you their ""Advanced DVR"" with 500 hours of storage. Recordings will always be the whole show even if you press record half-way through the broadcast.

For both of the above, you can get HBO Now separately for $15/mo, which will get you all HBO content via the HBO Now app.

Also note that max resolution depends on the source channel, which sometimes maxes out at 720p, and your internet connection(fuboTV recommends 20Mbps for their best quality). [fuboTV is doing some testing of 4K](https://support.fubo.tv/hc/en-us/articles/360011479911-Does-fuboTV-offer-any-content-in-4K-HDR-) but its device and channel support is currently limited.",1535549471

Some features are limited, but for the most part the DVR works just fine with manually scheduled and reoccuring recordings.

&gt; I read that the Tablo Dual 2-tuner version can stream to 6 devices at the same time. Does this mean that each device could watch a different show, or is it the same show to each device? Does the # of tuners only matter for recording? I thought you basically needed 1 / TV.

It can probably stream to 6 devices just fine on Ethernet, but you may have issues over WiFi streaming to that many devices simultaneously. Since there are only 2 tuners, you are limited to streaming only 2 live channels. Other TVs/devices can access the shows on the DVR, which does not use any of the tuners. The only exception to that is if you are streaming over the Internet, I believe it will use one of the tuners to re-encode the video for Internet broadcast (make it a bit smaller). I'm not sure why it uses a tuner, but I think it is because they have individual hardware encoders per tuner and broadcasting over the Internet requires the use of one of the hardware encoders (only guessing).

cordcutters,Not yet I don’t think.  Plus currently plex only allows for one EPG so you pick antenna or cable which frustratingly may have you missing some obscure antenna channels on your cable EPG selection.  ChargeTV for example.  I use cable EPG for local cable provider to dial in Silicon dusts channels they offer. But that excludes me from getting all antenna channels I can get since local cable company doesn’t offer them all.  And you can’t just add the ones you want.  Probably not explaining it perfectly.  Plex needs to allow for two EPG selections or add Silicon Dust premium channels as an option when selecting antenna as an EPG.  Thus getting all local channels and the premiums in the guide.  Even using two HDHomeRun doesn’t work because you are locked into one EPG source even with two different boxes through plex.  Only solution is to run two plex servers which has complications as well.  Seems this should be easy to address but being in this in the early stages is frustrating!

cordcutters,"&gt;so the satellites could be clustered in those latitudes

You can compress the constellation down so you can avoid the poles, but 1) now you lose arctic customers, who would probably be willing to pay a premium for your service simply because there is literally no other option for them, and 2) it doesn't change the math very much. Even if you triple the percentage to 9%, you still fall short of serving a significant fraction of US customers.

&gt;I also wonder if they might be able to cluster satellites longitudinally

Up to a point, but now you're putting satellites over the poles again, which is what you just wanted to avoid.

&gt;Simply having it available as an option would create competition and drive down the prices of terrestrial services accordingly.

I disagree. You can get 25Mbps+ broadband satellite internet today with a datacap. I don't see that making any significant impact on broadband today. Launching and maintaining satellite constellations and ground infrastructure is *really* expensive. It costs $750M/year just to maintain ~24 GPS satellites. It's almost always cheaper to install ground broadband infrastructure to a home than the satellite infrastructure.

I'll reiterate that I think there's a good business case for LEO satellite broadband but it's going to be for airplanes/cruise ships/business travelers/journalists/etc that are willing to pay a premium for it. But someone of moderate income in a rural area? Not a chance. There's simply too many people fighting over too little bandwidth for it to work.

As I understand it, YTTV lets networks force you to watch the VOD version instead of the DVR version if they wish, and you can't skip commercials on the VOD version.

cordcutters,"Fire Stick is likely your issue with Vue.  The hardware on the stick is pretty lacking especially if it's an older version.  Live sports requires a lot more than something more static like Netflix.  If I watch on my regular Fire TV, Apple TV, or PS4 the picture is very good.  Also how is your wifi?  If you can a wired connection is always better.  But i'm wireless on my 2017 version Fire TV ""dongle"" on a 100/100 connection and it's been fine.

In general if you go with the cheaper ""sticks"" (be it Roku, Fire etc.) you kind of get what you pay for.  You don't have to go all the way up to an $180 Apple TV necessarily, but at the same time spending more than $25-$30 on very basic stick would likely benefit you. 

From the other devices you mention.  I hear the Fire TV Cube runs well.  I see LOTS of people love the Nvidia Shield though I've never had experience with it.  I got my Apple TV off that 3 month Apple TV deal in the summer when sports wasn't as much of a concern, and now that the 3 months is over I moved back to Vue and it's nice.  And no matter what service you choose, Apple TV is one of the devices that pretty much ALL the services work on (Vue, Sling, Hulu Live, YTTV, and DirecTV Now).  I think Shield works with everything too.  But for example because  Google and Amazon won't play together,  YTTV doesn't work on Fire TV devices.",1535380268
cordcutters,"What does the TVFool report say the signal strength should be hitting you with at your location?

First make sure you don't have anything interfering on your line that's blocking the signals.  If you are repurposing the coax that was last touched by a Satellite or Cable installer be sure to open up your coax junction box and take a look to see what's in there. Dish Network has a ""hub"" that looks just like a regular splitter, but it's actually a switch and it will block most of the OTA signals that hit it. Anything that looks like a splitter you need to double-check or just assume it isn't and replace it to be sure. A 1000mhz splitter at Home Depot is only $3.80 and works perfectly. A real easy way to check your line in general is to run a short length of coax to the antenna and plug it into a TV and run a scan. If you get reception there, but not farther inside your home then there's too much attenuation happening.  Maybe there's a switch installed, maybe you have too many couplers or connections, but that'll point you in the right direction.

If your line checks out, then it's also possible the 150m antenna was working as intended but your signal was too close to you for it to be effective. Sometimes a signal that's closer than an antenna was designed for can be missed by the antenna.  A 150m antenna is optimized for signals that are much further away than 70m.  If that's the case, then the Yagi may work better.

However, if the terrain between you and the towers is filled with too many obstructions then it could just be that the signal is even too weak for a 150m antenna to pick up. Every building a signal hits, every tree, every obstruction between you and the tower is going to shave something off the signal. I have a couple channels coming in weak on my 70m rated Yagi because those towers are located on the other side of a couple of big hills that are covered in old growth forests.  Even though they're only 20 miles from me and my antenna is mounted on my roof and pointed directly towards them, the obstructions have widdled the signals down to a fraction of what they would be otherwise.",1535510750

cordcutters,"&gt; we're constantly told that socialism is bad.

I live in California.  We were promised a high-speed train from San Diego  to San Francisco for $33 billion.  NOW the legislature is saying it will cost $90 billion (three times the burden on us taxpayers).... and it will only cover LA to SF (sorry San Diegans... you're left out).  

- YES socialism is bad, because it spends a TON of money and gives minimal results.      By the time this high-speed train is built in 2040, we'll all be riding around in Self-Driving cars, most of them pollution-free EVs doing 100 mph down the I-5.  (Nobody will want to use a train in that environment.  They'll just use their cars.)

",1535335315
cordcutters,"False equivalence. Though I shop second-hand pretty much exclusively these days, so nice try anyway. 

An acquaintance of my mom's was a mushroom farmer in Ventura, CA. Family farm, living wages, union shop. One year, Walmart asked to buy 20% of his harvest, for a modest discount. But, hey, moving that much product at once saves him time/money too, right? 

The next harvest, same, but a little more product. Soon, they were buying almost his entire harvest; the rest of his client base dried up.

That's when Walmart told him what they would pay, and it was *far* below what it cost him to operate his farm. It would mean slashing pay, laying off dozens of workers, cutting corners.

And they waited until he was dependent on them.

So he sold the farm he'd worked to build. All those people with good jobs farming lost them. And make no mistake-- it's Walmart that killed those jobs.

That's how they do. Come into a community, sell at prices lower than any of the existing businesses can possibly compete with, even if they lose money for a while. Once the other businesses are closed, then the store can operate at a profit. (But not so much of a profit that they can actually pay their employees anything close to a living wage, of course.)

cordcutters,"I'd like to try and help you out!. Without writing a book and giving you a bigger headache:), I'll try to condense it and if you have more questions, just reply and I'll do what I can.

For your antenna: I think you'd be better with an omni-directional antenna, they do make flat ones with 2 horizontal wings that is for vhf. Also, make sure that the antenna has an amplifier. Disregard the distance claims on antennas, they are notoriously over rated for distance. Price also doesn't translate into better reception. Distance from transmitter, strength of signal that the network is sending. antenna height, terrain and most important DIRECTION TO THE TRANSMITTERS. Looks like your closest Fox station is Southwest, your NBC is Northwest and the others are North. Trying to pick those up without having to constantly re orient the antenna is going to be close to impossible. The omni directional aimed WEST would be halfway between everything but that's a very wide area. Some of the outdoor antennas do have a remote that controls a motor that will allow you to move the antenna remotely.

FYI: All of my transmitters are within 10 degrees of each other facing northwest, all are 19-25 miles away, I'm using a $35 RCA omni directional, rated for 55 miles but I think with my terrain, etc it's more like 30, with an amp and it is placed in my window sill at about 3 feet from the floor and I get great reception.

Make sure that your coax cable is RG6, try not to use a splitter but if have to, make sure to put a terminator on the unused connection(s).

FYI: I use an hd homerun with the antenna connected to the homerun and the homerun connected to my router via ethernet and stream it all to my tv's, I'm extremely satisfied with it, but won't get into all these details, just thought you may be interested. Good luck and if I can be of further assistance, just reply.",1535173450

It's not about deserving money either.  It's what the collective aggregate of individuals decide is more valuable, which they vote on with their dollars.

However, the return value the airline company manager gives the market is lower than the value the Hollywood producer gives the market.  This isn't my opinion, this is fact, as demonstrated by their take home pay.  

What you or I determine is somehow ""more worthy"" of being paid more is inconsequential.  The only thing that matters is what all of us want put together.

I currently subscribe to DirectTV Now, HBO, Prime, Hulu, Netflix, and Kanopy.  That plus Plex and a few OTA tuners = so much TV.

Verizon barely even argued with me when I canceled.  The rep went into the retention spiel but I shut her down and calmly explained ""I'm cutting the cable, period, not interested"" and got processed with little pushback.

They sent me postpaid boxes to return the equipment.  Make sure you save your proof of mailing until they acknowledge receipt.

Also, if you are paying a rental fee on your router it's in your best interest to just buy the $150 thing outright.  You have to tell Verizon this what you want to do and they typically will split this into three $50 payments so it doesn't kill your bill too badly.",1533225175

There could be some other explanation, but it was my assumption that they are just reselling the iPad unlimited plan and charging a premium for providing a valid iPad IMEI to AT&amp;T and doing the activation. You could try contacting them to find out for sure. 

Netbuddy.co may be a different story, but I have no firsthand experience with them.

cordcutters,"There are a lot of solutions if you just want to put some TV on as background noise.

Pluto TV also gives you a lot of live streaming channels for free; none of the major networks or anything like that, but a lot of channels of basic stuff you can use for background noise.  

On the paid end, yes, Hulu Live would give you what you're looking for.  So would any other live streaming service (Sling, Vue, Fubo, Youtube TV, Philo, etc.)

One other thing you might find of interest: search on Netflix for ""Slow TV"".  Each ""episode"" of that is several hours of low-energy content, like a train ride or watching a river.  It's the perfect thing to fall asleep to or use as background noise.",1535387600
cordcutters,"You could certainly try an omnidirectional antenna but such antennas have a poor reputation. One trick would be finding an actual omnidirectional antenna, most are not really.

Your signals are pretty much at right angles. That is somewhat optimal for combining 2 antennas with actual gain. You could try combining a couple of appropriate antennas with a high quality splitter/combiner. The bands in use for each area are the same so you could use the same antenna, twice. Examples:

* Winegard HD7694P
* Channel Master CM-2018

If you don't have the room for those antennas you would have to use something with less performance:

* Winegard HD7000R (without extensions)
* RCA ANT751

I have DirecTV w/ 4k channels (the only 3 that they have) and they look great... started a Hulu TV free trail to see how the image looks and performs vs satellite Directv and it looks a lot better.. even channels that broadcast in 720, my Sony x900f upscales it as much as possible making it look much cleaner, more accurate color wise, and with smoother motion. the only drawback is that in the little time that I have started the trail, there have been buffering issues and sometimes the stream would just go black, etc.. I have a 300 mbps internet connection that is directly connected to my streaming device instead of wifi and so I know that is not the issue.

I have to get more listings on my ""tv"" for free content.  We have prime &amp; netflex, and an OTA DVR.  We dropped curiosity stream because it was a recurring cost we were not taking advantage of (the content was pretty great for $6 a month)

I think the Hulu approach (maybe not implementation) was good.  Ad's can help reduce our costs, pay this much for services with ads, but if you don't want ads pay 2x.

What confuses me about CBS all access in Canada, is why the fuck did they even bother, all the good content is already sold to other streaming platforms, leaving you with the bottom of the barrel in what CBS has to offer. They should have just waited for those streaming rights to expire.

Otherwise, if you just want to end up with all the networks you might try one of those dual 4 bay UHF band antennas with one section pointed northwest and the other section pointed southwest. That would get you all the popular networks from reasonably strong transmitters. Examples:

* Stellar labs 30-2431
* Digiwave Ant7288 AKA Solid Signal HDB8X
* Digiwave Ant7287
* Antennas Direct DB8e

If you later found that you needed one of the signals in the VHF-high band (Springfield NBC, Hartford ABC) you could get a separate antenna for that band and combine it with the other antenna.

cordcutters,"First and foremost, the ability to watch what I want, when I want, which is what TiVo first brought to the table two decades ago. The ability to skip commercials was never anything more than a neat bonus feature which TiVo *also made possible* but it was never, for me, the prime motivator. Time-shifting is always what mattered most.

But my new most important criteria is to never overlay a commercial on top of the actual program. Network and Cable TV does this all the fucking time with their animated bullshit in the corner, and now Netflix is starting to do it too with their ""personalized recommendations"" instead of running credits full screen, which are *PART OF THE SHOW!*

So those are my top two. Do not truncate or obstruct any portion of the content for any reason, and there's no such thing as a schedule. Those are, without question, the worst parts of cable. Eliminate them, and I'm happy.

Maintain those two, and I'm perfectly happy to strike a balance between price and presence of respectfully-run commercials, where more or less of one would reasonably dictate the opposite of the other.",1535040888
cordcutters,"One thought, based on my own experience, if your cable provider offers a package with internet and very basic cable TV for cheap, (sometimes they are even cheaper than an internet only package), you might want to consider that, with a cable TV box only on the TV that gets the most network TV use, unless you can get those channels reliably over the air. Then try to use cable/OTA for those channels when possible, even if they are available to stream.

Why? A number of broadband providers are placing soft or hard caps on data usage. Most homes with average viewing habits on a single screen are unlikely to hit those caps, but if you have multiple screens streaming regularly, or have a household where a TV seems to always be on, those caps can become an issue.

If you stream 4K content, even more so.

Even though this may not impact most users, if you can secure viewing of basic channels cheaply through a package or OTA, it will give you more breathing room on potential data usage caps. If your provider already explicitly establishes such a cap in it's terms, I'd recommend this even more strongly.",1534780563
cordcutters,"When it comes to watching televised sports, I'm surely in the 99th percentile. I've used all the big cable/satellite providers over the years (Dish, DirecTV, Comcast, Uverse), but went exclusively to streaming earlier this year and am more satisfied as a sports fan paying $40/mo. for YouTube TV (plus $5/mo. for ESPN+ and $50/season for NBC's Premier League Pass) than I was paying much more for cable/satellite packages who didn't offer more of what I wanted, just more of all the BS I don't care about.

Seriously, look into YouTube TV. It has the local regional sports channel(s) as well as network stations, so you can follow your local NBA, NHL, MLB and NHL teams. It has all the ESPNs and Fox Sports channels, plus NBC Sports and CBS Sports. It has TNT/TBS/Tru for the NCAA Tournament and NBA. It has the MLB Network and NBA TV. It has unlimited DVR storage and very few channels that don't broadcast live sports. You can arrange the channel guide in whatever order you like, so I have all the channels I actually watch regularly (those that regularly broadcast live sports) at the top of my list.

It doesn't have NFL Network or NHL Network yet, but I'm sure they'll come. That said, there are only a handful of games exclusively on NFL Network and NFL coverage is found on plenty of other channels. For me, there are a couple soccer-heavy channels I'd like, but it doesn't sound like you're dying to see more La Liga or Ligue 1.

You're getting into ""It will never happen territory"" when you talk about getting every single game in every league through a normal TV package. Sorry, but if you want every NFL game, you'll need to pony up the money for NFL Sunday Ticket; the same goes for the NBA, MLB, NHL...

I actually take a la carte even one step further.  If there's a show I like to keep up to date with but don't have access to it, I will pay for the current season on Amazon.  Amazon releases the new episodes at midight on the day of their release.   With CBS All Access, CBS refuses to let Amazon do that with Discovery.  Just as I am sure they will refuse to do that with the new Picard Trek.  


I've been a cord cutter longer than most  (10 years).  And it's been nice having a lot of content spread out over 3 or 4 services during that time.   And each of them have been extremely cheap in comparison to cable.   And, yes, cable doesn't allow you to pick and choose.   But fragmenting existing services each into 10 - 20 dollars a piece is also not a good thing for existing cutters.  

If it turned into a true a-la-carte system where I could pay just for the exact show I want, as a one-time fee (like I have been doing with Amazon) then I wouldn't (and haven't) complain.  But CBS is paving the way for others to stop doing that.",1533570539

I bought an amp to try it and like you said it made no difference.

So back up into the attic - I brought the TV back up there, and I also used the Winegard TV Signal Finder app which has an altered reality mode and allows you to point your phone and ""find"" where the broadcast antennas are.  I focused on WRC-TV since thats what I had the biggest problem with.  Was able to adjust the antenna and get a stronger signal on WRC-TV and a really strong signal on WUSA - but strangely the signal on WJLA (ABC) and WDCW (CW) were lower as a result. CW makes sense because it is at a slightly different angle than the others, but I would have expected ABC and CBS to have similar strength signals since they're both at the same angle (and they're both VHF stations).

Not sure if ABC just has a lower broadcast strength or maybe they're doing maintenance today or something.

So far I seem to have a stable signal on NBC / CBS and CW seems good too.  Will cross my fingers and hope that it stays that way through weather changes and stuff!",1533492321

As far as the YTTV DVR/VOD issue, only about 25% of the networks force a VOD on you. Most all sporting events are straight DVR.

The majors like CBS, ABC, NBC, etc. will be most likely to force VOD.

Hulu? Not worth it at all unless you choose ""Enhanced Cloud DVR"". Otherwise you'll be looking  at (or trying to ignore) more commercials.

Comcast offered us a "" Basic"" TV (10 stations) service for an extra $10.   It's mostly evangelizing, or shopping channels; nothing I  would watch.  Plus, as soon as you subscribe to Comcasts TV service, there's all those fees back again.

So I'm watching for deals offered by streaming services ; seems to be some interesting things out there, close to Labor Day.

Direct TV Now was giving away Roku, Apple TV, for different levels; Showtime has several deals, including the limited time only Summer Deal ($5. mo for 3 mo).

I'm waiting for Oct/Nov when some of my favorite shows come back on, to subscribe to channels that offer them.

cordcutters,"It really comes down to what you want to see. Sports is a huge category and it matters where you live. 

For example. I’m in Little Rock, Arkansas. I want to watch Arkansas State, the Denver Broncos, Chicago Cubs, Nashville Predators, Memphis Grizzlies and Sporting KC. 

For AState this year I need CBS Sports Network, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPN+
-Broncos not checked the schedule yet but presumably I’ll get some OTA, ESPN and whoever has Thursday this year. For more need Sunday Ticket. 
-Cubs most via MLB.tv, some ESPN and Fox
-Predators one OTA, 10 or 11 NBCSN remaining 70 online via GameCenter but may get some via ESPN+
-Grizzlies some ESPN TNT and TBS rest via the local Fox RSN. I’m in market so blacked out online. 
-Sporting KC ESPN, ESPN2, FS1 most on ESPN+

The best scenario for an NFL, MLB, NHL, NBA, MLS cord cutter is to live in the same city as your favorite team so you get all of your favorite team’s games OTA and your favorite team in every other sport be out-of-market and subscribe to streaming plus a streaming package that has ESPN ESPN2 FS1 TBS and TNT 

For the college fan it gets crazy in a hurry because non-conference road games depend on the home team’s contract. You could end up on ESPN ESPN2 ESPNU CBSSN NBCSN Stadium Big Ten Network, SEC Network, Pac12 Network and LHN or any bizarre combinations of regional sports networks ",1534818319

I doubt subscribers will ever get to the point of allowing you to pick and choose which stations you'd want to watch. 

I still disagree about it being about age. Granted, I'm 42, but my son, his friends, and my older nephews and nieces all subscribe to television (whether its through traditional cable or through PS Vue, Sling, etc...). They range in ages from 20 - 26. One common factor among them is they are very much into watching sports. 

Would it be a fair assessment to say that it's very likely that neither yourself, nor most of your friends, are into sports? Not being able to watch every college game of my favorite team would drive me insane. LOL If I didn't care anything about watching sports, I would just stick to the antenna I have.

cordcutters,"Not OP, but thought I'd answer this question from a different perspective. I'll largely ignore the economics because honestly it's easy to generate whatever numbers you want because it's currently a niche market with impractical equipment and dial-up speeds so any assumptions are largely untestable at the moment. However, I agree with Musk that there is definite demand and a good potential market for satellite broadband if the costs can be made right.

The problem I see is just simply from the technical numbers.

Let's say that all of SpaceX's promises are completely true and they get [12,000 satellites](http://www.parabolicarc.com/2017/03/03/spacex-launch-12000-satellites/) up in the sky with [23 Gbps](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/spacex-plans-worldwide-satellite-internet-with-low-latency-gigabit-speed/) per satellite downlink. So a total available downlink of 276 Tbps. Sounds like a fantastical amount of bandwidth! There's no way we could use all that up, right?

But a problem crops up because that's distributed over the entire earth at all times because it's a constellation, and since the satellites are LEO they can't get great coverage outside of the area they are directly overhead.

So how much bandwidth would be available for the US?

* Let's take the area of the entire US (9.834 million km\^2)
* Multiply that a factor of \~1.5 (to account for the fact that the satellite can still ""talk"" to land even though it's over coastal waters). (\~15 million km\^2).  This is an extremely generous assumption, BTW.
* Divide that by the area of the entire planet (510 million km\^2)
* The answer you get (\~3%) is how much of the total bandwidth we calculated would be available to the entire US at any given time.
* So total bandwidth for the ENTIRE US ends up being about 8.3Tbps

That may sound like a lot, but that's divided over a potential market of over 350M people. Just to guarantee a passable 10Mbps at any one time, you could only service a maximum of 800,000 people.  So at the end of the day they will have to do one of two things:

* Increase the price of internet until demand matches the supply they have (and this would certainly cost much higher than ground alternatives)
* Don't guarantee any kind of speed and just make users deal with the congestion, or create pricing tiers for better service, or implement data caps. Essentially become exactly the same kind of ISP that everyone complains about but still use for lack of alternative.

BTW, I'm \*not\* saying that there isn't a business case here, but my point is that this will never be a widely-used, practical consumer broadband option simply because there just isn't enough bandwidth vs. the number of people. This is more appropriately geared for things like cruise ships, airplanes, business travelers, etc that don't mind paying several thousand a month for anywhere internet access.",1533190401

Not to attack you as the messenger, but that the ""internet has improved"" is a pretty vague and meaningless statement. The ""internet"" does not exist as a distinct entity that can be easily quantified in such a way; with investments in technology like 5G continuing to move forward, WISPs continuing to increase rural internet access, and municipal broadband investments demonstrating a positive ROI, I have no doubt that the ""internet"" has ""improved"" *for some*.

Locast is relying on Title 17, Chapter 1, section 111 a)5 of the Copyright Act. 

This section has exemptions from exclusive rights to broadcast transmissions. In this case, an exemption if ""the secondary transmission is not made by a cable system but is made by a governmental body, or other nonprofit organization, without any purpose of direct or indirect commercial advantage, and without charge to the recipients of the secondary transmission other than assessments necessary to defray the actual and reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the secondary transmission service.""

Hulu will have a **LOT** of problems in its future. 

An FCC stipulation of the NBC Universal and Comcast merger required (for 7 years after Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2011) not to exercise any right to influence the conduct or operation of Hulu. 

That clause just ended so who knows whats going to happen next.

Disney is [starting its own competing service](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/disney-streaming-service-2019-1202898412/) and despite what anyone here claims we really have no idea what the final product will offer but looking at [this chart of Disney holdings](https://www.titlemax.com/media/every-company-disney-owns-13_pageversion.jpg) if they did an inclusive bundle or more likely tiers like the classic cable model then to say the new offering would be disruptive would be an understatement. 

So who knows whats going to happen next.

* Back from dead laptop battery

I didn't expect to start writing so much I guess what I wanted to point out is that Hulu wasn't built to rival Netflix, it was made as an alternative to the unlicensed Youtube uploads and Jason Kilar, the early CEO helmed the company to so successfully that early rumors suggested partners regretted merging and they wanted more independent control of their respective content and in light of recent events we should expect changes at Hulu in the coming year.

I say this because wonky interface aside (let's be honest the Amazon Video Marketplace/ Prime Video is its own slice of confusing UI) I like Hulu as it currently is, but caution fandom in the face of looming disaster.

I haven't seen the Sixers regularly appear on the antenna in quite some time, and the last time I saw the Flyers on OTA was when I think they played in the Winter classic.

cordcutters,"&gt; check reviews

I did, every review I read, even the one from rtings.com said that the TCL was the best value.  That's the key thing.  Value.  Yes you can spend a few hundred more for something slightly better.  But that doesn't really improve the experience enough to justify the cost.  It's not until you get into the TVs over $1000 that you really see any substantial enough improvement in picture quality to make spending the extra money worth it.  But not everyone wants to spend that much on a TV.  Just like not everyone wants to buy a Ferrari (or insert your favorite expensive car here) and prefers to get Hondas or Toyotas (or even Kias).  They just want something good enough to suit their needs at a cost that is reasonable.

&gt; at the entry level price point you'll get a better picture from a nicer 1080p TV then going for that 4k

Maybe a few years ago.  Most manufacturers have switched all their lineups to 4k only, except for their smallest of screen sizes.  So there's not much choice if you want something that is 40+ inches, just like there isn't much choice in finding a non-Smart TV nowadays, either. 

&gt; even if you may have to buy a separate streaming box

Funnily enough, I do have a separate streaming box.  In fact, you could say I have the Ferrari of streaming boxes (an Nvidia Shield).  But even though it's the most expensive/highly regarded streaming device available, there are some apps that aren't available for it (even via sideloading).  So it was a nice bonus that the TV that I bought had a Roku already included that I could use for those apps that aren't available on Android TV.  Could I have bought a standalone Roku to use with a non-Roku smart TV?  Sure... but now you're making that other TV cost an extra $50 at the least (for a Roku Stick, more if someone wanted an Roku Ultra instead), which reduces that TV's value even further.",1535672984

But you are still going to have lots of signal because you are so close to the transmitters. Unfortunately those signals will be a wild jumble of reflections from nearby objects and refraction from the edge of the building and antenna is on and any buildings in the way.

I have never heard of a good fix for this. If the paper clip doesn't work you could try some sort of antenna with gain in combination with a hefty atennuator.

- And given Verizon's ability to lobby for government handouts (PA/NJ offered tax credits if FiOS was installed), I don't think the lobbyists would overlook changing any law that forced them to keep copper.

Why assume that they didn't?

Disney is leasing the Star Wars rights for $MassiveMoney that justified the lease in its entirety, securing oodles of money.  Next step they're collecting *all other* Star Wars content on a single service including secondary series and new, original, *exclusive*, Star Wars content.  They're also launching a game-changing multi-tiered multi-media service for which Star Wars in its entirety accounts only for a small fraction, as they're a *huge* content producer.

They will be usable for a maximum of 5 years after the national roll-out since stations will be required to continue broadcasting in ATSC 2.0, but it's still borrowed time. That's probably the most appealing thing about going with a Tablo. The hardware will be obsolete and abandoned the same time as all the Tivos, but *if* Tablo is still around and *if* DVRs are even a thing after ATSC 3.0 (which allows broadcasters to encode a no-record code if they want) then the lifetime subscription paid to Tablo will follow a person when they purchase a new device.",1535675214

So to prevent handing out free basic cable they'd have to run around and install filters on every tap that isn't a current subscriber, plus they'd have to put one on if you stopped subscribing.

Open support for ClearQAM for basic cable would be an absolute time sink and cost them tens of thousands in tech salary and hardware in every single town they service every single year.

I am super frustrated because I cannot get my local PBS (I got it once, by luck but cannot replicate), but can get many other channels from the same transmitter, which is only 7-8 miles away. Granted, there is a modest hill in between me and that transmitter, so I'm assuming for the channels I do receive, they are reflected (and therefore complicated). My antenna is outdoors, barely, on an enclosed patio on a lower floor of a multi-story condo. I've tried (and returned) 4 different antennas.

As for whether you could have Cable TV and FiOS Internet, as long as you are in a home and not an apartment, there's no technical reason for not being able to. FiOS Internet is delivered via fiber optic cable to an ONT box(Optical Network Terminal) in your house. From there you can choose between a Coax connection to their proprietary router, or an Ethernet connection to any router you want. Cable TV is delivered via a Coax line.

cordcutters,"I don't think 40-45 yards is that long tbh.  In my experience involving coax, a properly terminated end, and using the proper gauge/impedance cable is infinitely more important.   Signal ingress interference is very real.  Coax related signals, unlike an AC power cord or RJ-45 type networking connection, is very sensitive to connectors, and breaks etc.  Each time you try to use a barrel coupler connector, to join two coaxes, you increase the potential for db loss.  But I do know some cabletv installers actually intentionally add a coupler at the demarc location, and ground it to a waterline, etc to protect things from lighning strikes, etc.  Also, make sure it is outdoor rated coax, i've had indoor rated cat6 I left baking in the sun for a few months totally go bad and crack on me.

cordcutters,"There are lots of options as many have pointed out so far. How much effort/money do you want to put into making the connection?   

On the spendy side you can hire someone to pull a cable(presuming the owner if not you, will allow that) to the location you want the TV, keep in mind you still have to worry about power and stuff.  

The budget way to do it is with floor cord covers and clever placement of furniture.

The next step up is using Wiremold or something similar hide the wire along the walls.  Usually paintable if you want to hide it better.

My best suggest is to make a diagram of the wire layout you want and then plan from that.  Include power, data and any audio cabling you might need.  If you can look ahead a bit and plan for possible future expansion.

Alternate suggestion, replace your WiFi router with a better quality one so you can just use WiFi.",1535554141

I was just checking out the demo a few minutes ago. I'm amazed that it works with a Connect Duo. They let you watch the cable channels for a few minutes and then punt you into a slick, highly produced ad for the service. It reminded me of the channel that would only show up on hacked Dish Network receivers where they would urge you to sign up or face significant jail time.

cordcutters,"I've had them both for a few years. Overall I prefer Netflix still, though I understand the dings against their catalog. It has definitely gone south since their heyday a few years back. A lot of stuff that was on Netflix has moved to Amazon Prime or Hulu or elsewhere.

I prefer Netflix's original content so far, haven't really gotten into much of Amazon Prime's. I will be trying out Jack Ryan and some other things this fall though.

I prefer Netflix's app. With Prime it's hard to tell if a show is actually available to watch or if I have to pay. Maybe there is a way to filter it, but I haven't found it yet. It takes more clicks to get something into my watchlist, and it's harder to discover new content on Prime in my experience.

AFAIK none of the law societies provide free subscriptions to the traditional services, but often law libraries and general libraries do have those subscriptions and are open to the public. The free services are pretty good, but if I ever worked in a small firm, I might do most of my research down at the libraries instead of using the free services.

I was curious what your state bar provides in addition to research subscriptions. Do they provide other material benefits?

cordcutters,"First, launch costs are a small part of mission costs. The idea that somehow the world has been waiting for SpaceX is utter nonsense: the bird and all the associated infrastructure is where most of the cost is.

Now, with respect to LEOs it is important to understand that all non-geostationary satellites move. Sounds silly, I know, but its important to keep this in mind. The closer you are to Earth, the faster you move.

So if you've got LEOs they are moving very quickly. This means, pretty much you need all the birds to form essentially a ""shell"" around the planet. No shell, no coverage, anywhere.

OK. Now, think about the Earth: most of it is water, desert, and arctic. About 80% is water or desert, and a goodly part of the remainder is arctic. Let's say its only 5%. So 85% of the Earth is essentially uninhabited - yes there are a few people living on boats, in deserts, etc., but it is minimal. 

Many countries have rules about things like who can sell telecom services. It is highly unlikely China, Russia, Iran, and many other countries are going to permit SpaceX or anybody else to sell broadband to their citizens. Russia is about 11% of the world's land mass, China is another 6%. Canada has very strict rules about telecom and its about 6%. There is some double counting regarding water and arctic but it should be pretty clear that maybe a few percent of the LEO ""shell"" is going to be over serviceable areas at any given time. Lets say its 10% but it is probably less than 5%.

About 55% of the world's population live in cities. Most people living in cities either have Internet or can't afford it. Availability is not an issue for the most part in cities. Yes, the US sucks, but that is a policy issue, not a technology issue and it will likely be solved with 5G.

That leaves a few hundred million people, the vast majority of who are desperately poor. Median world household income is less than $10K and it is unlikely somebody with a household income less than $10K is going to pay for broadband. Don't forget, this isn't a situation where local costs are important: the LEOs, land stations, etc., are gonna cost the same in New York as in Bangladesh. There is no way you are going to get a positive ROI on a LEOSAT constellation with a population like that.

Meanwhile, wireless broadband technology is being deployed rapidly. It is inexpensive and quick to deploy. I live on a farm and have the good fortune of hosting an LTE tower for fixed wireless. Before that I was a fixed wireless customer. The service quality keep improving and 5G is coming quickly. 5G makes a hell of a lot more sense for fixed wireless than than for mobile.

Hulu LiveTV: $40/month, but that's only a 50 hour DVR and it doesn't let you skip commercials. For another $15/month (up to $55/month now), you get a 200 hour DVR and can skip commercials on it.

Fubo wouldn't work for you, as a college football fan, because it doesn't have the ESPNs.

So then you buy the $60 top-of-the-line indoor model, only to find out that it doesn't work much better than the $10 model you previously had, and now you have to either suck it up or look into setting up an outdoor model.


OR, you could spend $10 and an afternoon and have an antenna that performs just as good as the top-of-the-line indoor models. And if it works for you, you can get a better-looking indoor model, secure in the knowledge that you aren't wasting money on something that's not going to work.",1534120763

TubiTV has actually been getting pretty good lately, with a bunch of interesting stuff to watch. My only major criticism is that their browsing functionality is super clunky. They have a ton of categories, but they aren't organized in any way, not even alphabetically. Same issue with shows in those categories, as they also aren't sorted in any apparent way. 

For example, ignoring the fact that RWBY is included in the ""Anime"" category for some reason, volumes 1 and 3 of the show are listed next to each other, but you have to scroll way down to find volume 2. Almost makes you think they don't have volume 2 at all.

For others who prefer to use their phones as the primary hotspotting device (and to use one SIM card for data and true voice calling, instead of Google Voice), T-Mobile's ONE Plus International has offered unlimited LTE hotspot for the past year.

However, that plan is being retired by T-Mobile tomorrow.

As you can see on the T-Mobile [plan webpage](https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans), it's the only one that offers unlimited ""4G LTE mobile hotspot data.""

IIRC very analog channel they convert frees up enough space to add like 8 digital channels and each digital channel is good for something like 7 mb/s down by 1.4 mb/s up. (Don't quote me on those numbers, my memory is shaky).

So by converting their system to all digital they free up enough Spectrum on their cable plant to start cranking up the speed. Spectrum in my area is currently 100 x 10 on the _slowest_ plan.

If they'd used ClearQAM they would have had continue the tap filters which was costing them a shit ton of money. Do you LIKE having your cable bill go up?

I would switch to fiber in a heartbeat if I could most of the fiber options in my metro area are the same price as cable internet only once you are done with ""introductory"" pricing for X amount of months.  

I feel bad for the reps that have to push these plans on people.
I hate the hassle they put you through to get what you want not what they want to sell you.
I hate introductory prices and having to sign longterm contracts where you know the rate will change. 

I was lucky last time I moved, I called to cancel my cable and told them I was moving to an area outside their service. They wanted to double check so I gave them an address to hunting property out in the middle of nowhere and they knew they couldn't sell me anything.

The house I moved to I had antenna but needed internet. I signed up with a different cable company that already had a hook up to the house. They had internet only for $30 a month no contract, after awhile I got a notice saying congratulations we increased your speeds.

I see maybe 2-3 movies a year, but a lot of times I would want to see one movie multiple times, but couldn't justify the extra 10-15 bucks. Movie pass was great for those movies I wanted to see 2 -3 times. My local theater is 10 bucks per ticket so as long as I averaged 12 movies a year it was a good deal.

*Here’s how it works: Locast.org operates under the copyright statute that allows non-profit translator services to rebroadcast local stations without receiving a copyright license from the broadcaster. The statute (17 U.S.C. 111(a)(5)) simply states that a non-profit organization may retransmit a local broadcast signal and even charge a fee to cover the cost of operations*

It sounds like it's really a service to expand availability within the existing local market, likely for those with a bad (or no) signal coverage at their physical location.

and of course i understand this is different for different folks and such based on their needs and setup. it's just unacceptable to pay for a service with such restrictions in my book. yttv works everywhere and the family sharing is a nice plus too. they have all my locals, and the interface and the reliability of the service have both been fantastic. light years beyond the competition, from my experience.

i do subscribe to philo for the scripps stuff (could easily do without) but for $16 i'm not going to gripe too badly. it works quite well and while the interface isn't nearly as polished or robust as yttv, it works, and so does the DVR. :P

cordcutters,"I had this exact issue when I moved into the house. We're on RCN, but there was another, obviously abandoned coax coming from the pole on the opposite side of my house that was hanging really low and I hated it.

The problem, however, is that in some counties, tv and phone providers often have the right to keep wires running to your house, and often times, the right to keep equipment (like FiOS terminals) on your property, even if you don't subscribe to their service. The rationale being, it's not fair to make Verizon spend the money to add fiber to a house, then have to remove it, then reinstall it again, because the house happens to sell to different owners over time with different preferences.

I had my electrician over the very first week and he suspected I might get some resistance if I called the county about a line that was simply ugly, but not necessarily dangerous. So he said, I got you. He cut it from the house and let it fall in the yard. Then he told me to call the county. I called and said, ""There's a line hanging from the pole into my yard."" They called Comcast and a guy rolled out the very next morning and removed it.

I'm NOT saying to do what my electrician did. I'm just saying, when you call the county (and you should...they often have cable company affairs departments that handle stuff like this), they might tell you there's nothing you can do. Good luck.",1535723254

cordcutters,"Channels DVR ($8/mo or $80/yr, but no lifetime subscription option) offers the first month of service for free. You should sign up for it and set up the DVR and see how you like it. I did a one-month trial of the Plex DVR on my Apple TV a few months back but didn't keep it. But I know that it's gotten better since then, including adding support for live TV with a traditional grid guide. I've been using the Channels app for months now but only for live TV. I've never tried their DVR. From what I've seen, I tend to think that I'd prefer the UI and user experience of Channels DVR over Plex DVR maybe a little but I doubt I'd find it enough better to justify an extra $80/yr. Since you already have a Plex Pass, there's zero additional cost for using Plex DVR. Anyway, only you can say whether the cost is worth it. So just try Channels DVR free for a month. There's no risk. And I'm pretty sure you can continue to keep using Plex DVR and Channels DVR at the same time with the same HDHomeRun tuner, so it's not like you have to ""break"" your Plex DVR set-up. (Just don't try scheduling BOTH DVRs to record the same show at the same time.)",1534876401
cordcutters,"Mostly depends on what you think you'll be missing out on, I think. I would actually pair Choice with one other OTT (so you can get the most channels possible you actually want, leaving out clutter and avoiding overlap if done right). Note that other OTT services also have varying configurations DVR and ODM (useful also via TV Everywhere).

Here's what I recommend:
I presume you get internet already. First, choose a(n) ecosystem/platform. Roku, Chromecast, AppleTV and Nvidia Shield are a one-time cost. Amazon, plex are a subscription service. Decide if you want to add additional monthly content distributors like Hulu and Netflix. Pluto and Xumo are free (for now). Have a disc player just in case.

Next, check your local options: Didja is in a few markets. Antenna is a one time cost. Another comment in this thread mentioned exploring any local library's options. Do you live near a Redbox kiosk?


Finally...are you one Spectrum internet promo pricing? If you so much as try the free trial of Choice, kiss that promo goodbye!

cordcutters,"Generally, an RF amp increases signal strength that is otherwise so weak on a long cable as to be no stronger than noise.   So it must be adjacent to the antenna. Your antenna is adjacent to the TV.  If the TV is any good, its amplifier is already doing what is best.

No specification numbers are provided for that Belkin.  But those protectors do nothing to protect hardware.  And can diminish a signal - lower it to noise levels.  Best is to remove that protector since it does nothing useful and may be only making a noisier TV signal on some channels.

Your solution starts with other parameters.  Putting it higher really is not useful. Instead, name everything in a line between that antenna and each TV station.  Including bricks, air ducts, other buildings, trees, mountains, etc  Only then are we beginning to discuss a solution.

What is this antenna?  A yagi?  A dipole?  Tuned for which frequencies (low VHF, high VHF, UHF)?  What are the frequencies of each station?

The (flawed) thinking is that taken as a whole, customer interactions should only take some period of time, say, 10 minutes apparently, in this case.  

If management sees handle time increasing, or suddenly drop, there's something going on that needs addressing.

This is actually a useful metric, taken on the whole, across multiple agents and a large time period (like a month or three).  

However, bad management fails to understand what the word ""average"" means and tries to drive the AHT down to individual agents over small time periods, like a day.  Then they give agents bonuses for ""good"" AHTs and shit, which just drives behaviour like hanging up on customers to bring the AHT down.  

Shit, even the name is an indication of bad focus -- average ""handle"" time.  It's not measuring issues resolved, or customer satisfaction, it's just ""how long did you talk to them?"".  ",1533493928

Most of the time, however, I just tune to whatever subscription service I'm currently using and watch specific programming there. When I'm done and want to watch something on another service, I switch, and repeat this process regularly.

To get around the fact American shows aren't long enough to fill the whole half hour or hour long slot with our shorter ad breaks the channels will air adverts for other shows on that channel (this is excempt from the restrictions placed on  advertising) to pad the breaks out a bit

When I first visited America I couldn't believe the frequency of ad breaks, the practice that really pissed me off was how they'd show like a minute of the programme or the opening titles and then go straight to break or how they'd go to break at the end of a show and then return just to show the end credits.",1534229761

On networks like CBS I can FFW through commercials if I watch within the first 24 hours. When a commercial starts on the DVR, if there is no countdown timer you can FFW. If there is a countdown timer that means ads were inserted and you can’t FFW.  For me personally about 30% of what I watch on Hulu has added commercials so the added fee for the “enhanced” DVR isn’t really worth it unless I need the space. But at least there is the option for those that find value in it. ",1535164854
cordcutters,"Exactly.  And as you can see, I couldn't even fill up a base 25 slot option.  Those 13 channels would be pretty much all the channels watched here including the tykes so the cable company would still end up giving me extra channels that I likely don't want.

I think back in the day, it was easier for cable companies to jive their customers because you were going from the traditional channels (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, KCAL and KCOP plus whatever you could find on UHF) to literally hundreds of channels that you'd never seen, had or heard of before.  So of course *then* it was like,""OMG, this is AWESOME!""  

But it's just gotten to a point where you can only fill so many channels and timeslots with unique content without doubling over or being repetitive combined with the totally unnecessary high cost.  And unlike back in the 80s/90s, people are hip to the cable companies trying to bleed their customers dry now.

cordcutters,"[“The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal &amp; Free the Net”](http://irregulators.org/bookbrokenpromises/) by Bruce Kushnick (Free download)

&gt; America’s households and businesses have been overcharged at least nine times for broadband/fiber optic services, including the wiring of schools, libraries, and hospitals— about $4000-$7000 per household, and the total is way over ½ trillion dollars by 2016. You can thank just a few companies: AT&amp;T, Verizon and Centurylink, who control the state-based utilities, along with the cable companies, Comcast and now-Spectrum et al. And this is the low number.

cordcutters,"Based on you saying your internet bill is $51/month I’m going to assume you have the 150mbps plan. I just got Comcast internet a month ago and I’m using the NETGEAR cm500 modem. The cm500 is 16x4 and so far has been working great. In the middle of the day, I get about 50mbps down and I get the full 150 starting around 7pm.

As for antenna, I don’t have one because my condo has a deal with Comcast so all residents get free basic cable. But I did have one at my last apartment and they are good for getting local channels like ABC, Fox, CBS, PBS. So it’s great for watching nationally televised events and such. I used it for the super bowl and some basketball and soccer matches. Antennas now get channels in HD and they look great. Just google what channels are available OTA in your zip code and their signal strength and you’ll have a good idea of what the antenna can offer you. ",1534255507
cordcutters,"Hulu w/Live is great, especially when considering that you get access to Hulu’s base VOD catalog, plus any additional VOD added with the Live TV add-on.

I would go ‘all-in’ for the best value.

Hulu with Live TV + the no commercials* add-on + the Enhanced 200hr DVR** add-on is $60, and this includes the base Hulu VOD catalog of TV shows, originals, movies, and day after it airs network TV with no commercials (no other service has this.)

*The no commercials add-on does not apply to the additional VOD you get the from additional Live TV channels. It only applies to the base Hulu VOD catalog.

**The Enhanced DVR is required for being able to FF commercials.

A few other benefits of Hulu w/Live is that there are no DVR restriction on recording local channels and you get both East and West coast feeds.

I also did not like the FF/Rwd feature, the line would move without showing you where you were at in the show so it was a guessing game trying to skip commercials.  I could have dealt with the ff/rwd issue but the final straw (along with the price) was the poor customer service with PlayStation.  When I tried to pay my bill after the first month I was unable to get any credit card to go through online (yes the where all good, I tried 3 different ones) so I called customer service.  Their response was ‘yeah the system does that sometimes, we’re not sure why’.  When I asked if it was being worked on, the reply was ‘Yeah I think so but I don’t have no ETA.’ And finally when I asked how I should pay I was told ‘Go buy a gift card from Amazon and pay that way.’  
I initially choose Vue because my Roku’s where too old for YouTube TV but after a month I bit the bullet and just upgraded the Roku’s and made the switch.

cordcutters,"&gt; Spectrum did this by deliberately limiting port capacities to content providers unless they paid for the connections. In layman’s terms, it was engaged in a form of extortion.

Understand how peering works. A peering agreement is fair if both parties benefit equally. If the traffic is lopsided one side ends up paying. Netflix is not a good peer. They send *far* more than they receive.

Port capacities *are limited*. Do you have any idea how much data Netflix pushes? So much that Spectrum needed to expand infrastructure to handle it.

&gt; One of the companies named in the suit was Netflix, which refused to pay the fees. It even offered to freely install its own equipment on Spectrum’s ""last mile"" to improve subscribers’ content delivery. Spectrum insisted on payment instead. The squabble continued between 2012 and 2014, during which time Spectrum never informed customers why their access to Netflix was subpar.

Why should Spectrum accept the burden of hosting Netflix server appliances within the Spectrum Network? Instead the parties agreed to make a direct link between themselves.

&gt; Riot agreed to pay Spectrum in August 2015 in hopes of lowering latency. The company, which started tracking its data in 2013, provided proof that Spectrum’s latency was well above 100ms (graph above). Furthermore, even after paying the cable provider to connect ports, latency only lowered to about 90ms — nowhere close to the 60ms threshold. Packet loss also remained well above two percent during the same period.

If Riot and Spectrum agreed to 60ms then Spectrum may be in breach of contract. But this has nothing to do with net neutrality.",1533165232

What really pissed me off about Comcast was they insisted that I had 100mbps service, even though their wiring in my neighborhood only supported up to 20mbps service.

cordcutters,"&gt;Wouldn't they already be satisfied by existing satellite ISPs then, anyway?

Possibly, but you are now cutting off high-margin potential customers and giving them to your competition for no benefit.

&gt; I was thinking of clustering the satellites both latitudinally and longitudinally.

The more I think about this, you actually get no benefit from doing anything here because 1) longitudinally the satellite has to orbit several times before the US rotates under it. The rest of the time it won't be over the US, and 2) latitude you can't do anything about. The satellite has to spend equal amounts of time over each hemisphere. Increasing the latitude just means the satellite also spends the same amount of time on the southern latitude. The only way you can gain is by cutting off higher latitudes. You can't really cluster it for certain times of day because it's LEO (orbit time is ~90-120 minutes).

&gt;Again, SpaceX is not the only company looking to do this. So we can't do the math simply based on their numbers

Perhaps, but SpaceX also has the most optimistic pie-in-the-sky numbers out of anyone. If it can't work with those numbers, it can't work with worse ones. And how many different satellite internet services do you think there will be? I'd guess at best 3. Even if you triple the numbers, it's still inadequate.

I mean, if you can show me some math about how it could be possible, I'd be more than willing to look at it, but I'm an engineer and I've crunched this several different ways using SpaceX's own numbers. There is simply not enough bandwidth to satisfy the number of people without broadband in the US. It cannot simultaneously be fast and cheap at the same time. You'll notice SpaceX *never* defines what ""low-cost"" satellite internet actually means. $500/month for unlimited satellite broadband is cheap if you're an airline or a cruise ship, not if you're joe sixpack in Nebraska.",1534276752

Typically these deals were signed before All Access existed. Same with Elementary if I recall correctly.

For much older shows (like JAG), if there are episodes missing, it means they were not able to secure new streaming  rights to the music. Some old shows have a lot of copyrighted music in them.

(Yes, I know Under the Dome is no longer airing but it was the first of summer shows to get this licensing set up. And yes, it was crappy and deserved to be cancelled.) ",1534708750

I have one ISP available at my house.  If AT&amp;T decides to partner up with facebook and block reddit, then I can't use reddit.  AT&amp;T could decide that my Netflix stream should be slowed down or cut off because they would prefer I used Hulu.  That's too much power to be left in the hands of a private company.  The power company can't tell me which refrigerator brand I can plug in, so why should the ISP be allowed to tell me which web services are allowed?

We have lots of choices when it comes to social media.  The only power they have is the power we give them.  Facebook might seem like they control everything, but if you don't like it, you are free to leave.  That's why we are here on reddit, because we chose to come here instead of posting on Facebook.

Comcast has been tight fisted when offering their sports channels to satellite, but they're more forthcoming with OTT streaming services. I get NBC Sports Philly (formerly Comcast SportsNet) with YouTube TV. So I can watch pretty much every Phillies, Sixers and Flyers game with that. The only exception is when there are 2 games at once (which happens sometimes when baseball season overlaps hockey and basketball seasons), and since I don't get NBC SP+, I don't get to choose which one of the two I watch.

cordcutters,"for at least the next 10 years I do not see anything significant changing.. I think people get caught up in the idea that streaming will replace other forms of distribution but its just not going to happen.. people also want to do away with commercials on current seasons of shows and that is never going to happen... 

to understand the future you have to understand the past

when television first came to market most of the shows were educational and news. It wasn't for a very long time that entertainment took over the television industry but even when it did and when all tv was still ota and live not prerecorded or preproduced.. it was companies that funded these shows.. try to find an old episode of You Bet Your Life with Groucho Marx which ran from 1947 to 1961 .. they would do live commercials.. often for cigarettes or gasoline stations or car companies.. big corporations that found value in tv commercials vs print or other forms of advertising... today when was the last time you saw a Pepsi or McDonalds commercial .. really big companies that marketed on tv in the 70's through about 2000 and now its other products.. maybe the My Pillow.. but the guy has made hundreds of millions in sales selling those pillows.. and with low overhead.. 

the thing is advertisers use a form of advertising and then closely watch their sales based on that advertising.. 

The saying for NASCAR use to be ""*Win on Sunday*, sell on *Monday*"" because the winning cars would sell the next week and they measured the sales and their sponsorship was relative to sales..

So a lot of people approach this and say if I pay $40 a month for streaming that should be enough to cut out all the commercials.. 

Totally negating the fact that billions.. hundreds of billions of dollars are as a result of advertising

Les Moonves of CBS just had a conference call last week and he was talking up his advertising sales for CBS and for sports.. and how well his shows are doing and how sales are up.. and he wasn't talking about income from a handful of streamers.. 

It will take until July of 2020 until the Repack of OTA is completed and after that we have ATSC 3 on the way.. that may take 10 years to complete... including the fact that we will all need to buy new televisions.. so manufacturing has to catch up.. standards have to be set...

But nothing huge will really change from this the same basic premise will be that OTA will exist and it will be the standard.. other forms of distribution will be redistributing content or they will be distributing niche content 

People are supplementing their viewing with streaming in a large way but a handful of netflix shows a handful of amazon shows or even as they progress over the next few years is not going to change the larger market and standards of the past... 

What will happen is these streaming services will find out that content can't be produced on mass without advertising.. it just won't be possible over the long run

you see what you have to understand the product isn't the tv show or movie.... the product is you.. and you are being sold to the highest bidding advertiser.

thats my take on it.. if you don't agree thats your right

But what did zuckerbot say... he will never go to a pay portal system because it couldn't fund his company.. he makes too much money off of selling information about his members.. and he said that to congress on multiple occasions ..

The idea is that there is little water and snow at the peak of a roof so you don't need much to keep it out. Don't remember how long that lasted but it was a significant number of years.

cordcutters,"&gt;You can also use the HDhomerun app as a channel input so the channels are integrated with your other sources like Pluto TV.

What is the best use for a feature like this?  As I understand the way Live Channels works on the Stream+ you can also just get your OTA channels directly on the Stream+ and integrate the same channels into the Live Channels guide with PlutoTV, too? I think I'm missing something.

&gt;Amazon is rumored to have a OTA DVR coming that is code named Frank. Maybe they will get it right.

I read a leak about that recently. If Amazon uses their leverage to get some agreements from various streaming television providers to allow their guides to be fully integrated into a single channel program guide that includes all the OTA channels (if someone subscribes to one of those providers) and creates a device with at least 2 tuners and the ability to pair multiple devices together then they could hit a home-run.  They have the ability, I'm just concerned their interest is mostly in selling videos and their own season-pass subscriptions. I am anxious to see what they come up with, though.  

A little off-topic, but I'd like to see a DVR maker with clout follow Sling's lead with a more agnostic and open framework and pressure all the streaming providers to make their guides available for integration based on what their subscribers are receiving. 

Sling is really on track with the AirTV/AirTV Player concept.  They're the first streaming service provider to have integrated their channel guide with anything else at all. Integrating over-the-air free channels from antennas with their own streaming service, inside the same grid-based channel guide, has taken far too long. No one wants to switch back and forth from a ""OTA channels app"" to a ""SlingTV app"" anytime they want to go between seeing what's on AMC and what's on their local PBS affiliate or sub-channels. It shouldn't make a difference whether we are getting our channels from a streaming service provider or an antenna -- they should just all be placed inside a single program guide with 14-day program data and DVR ability regardless. I wish more providers had followed Google's lead with the Live Channels option that they made available. It's there just waiting to be used by any provider that wants to do the same thing.

I read the other day that it costs a cable provider between $10-$15/mo for ever single subscriber just to pay the ""re-transmission fees"" to give their subscribers the local over the air stations that are floating around in the air for free. Maybe it's a little less for streaming providers, but it's wasteful.  If more people could get OTA through an antenna integrated with subscribed streaming channels in the same guide then it would reduce the demand and those re-transmission fees would start to go down or more providers would just decide they don't need to do it anymore at all and prices could come down on streaming packages.",1535522455

Most common entrepreneur mistake: basing your pricing on what YOU would pay.

Which scenario makes more money:

a) selling 100 widgets for $1000 each
b) selling 1000 widgets for $100 each

The answer if a, because even though they both have a gross revenue  of $100,000, the cost associated with selling 100 units is less than the cost associated with selling 1000 units, so the net revenue will be greater.

Apply this to your scenario. Maybe there are 9 million people who would pay $5 for a service, but if there are 3 million who would pay for it at $15, they are better off selling it for $15.

Also, after spending this spring and summer trying out all the other streaming services to see how they compare, we'll likely use Philo instead of Vue for months outside football season and March Madness, and we'll save even more.

Once DBS left rural America for the suburbs they figured out sports fans are bonkers. So cable offered ESPN ESPN2 and your local regional sports network and DBS was like hell we are already beaming all the RSNs so pay $5 and watch everything not blacked out. Sports fans moved. 

Cable suddenly had to give in for crazy carriage fee requests or the sports fan will move. Hell the Mad Men fan would move. 

Competition meant give in on fees or lose customers. 

Then digital OTA arrives and Netflix comes along and consumers who could get what they wanted ditched cable and satellite and more entered to compete as well. 

The next phase is going to be more pay services like CBS and the coming Disney streamer. 

Consumers will discover they either have to have a lot of subscriptions or give up some content. 

Not everyone will make it and those who falter will be bought by others slowly consolidating things again.

Well the problem with a solution like that may be the complexity and expense of a solution like that.  For say ""Packers games"" that you talk about...

Problem 1... can you negotiate with the NFL just for rights to individual teams or will they make you pay for transmitting ALL teams.
Problem 2. Assuming a distributor is paying for all teams, and individual subscribers want to pay a smaller fee for just one team Packers.  Can they be profitable or do their costs they had to eat off for all teams exceed profits from people just wanting to pay $5 per team.  
Problem 3.  Do they charge the same fee for all teams?  Or is there a bigger fee for more ""in demand"" teams like the Cowboys, Patriots, and Packers and a ""second tier"" fee for say the Titans and Buccaneers?

Problem 4.  Say they are able to negotiate rights for individual teams from the NFL.  Do you have say 32 different companies ""Packers TV"", ""Patriots TV"", ""Chiefs TV"" transmitting each team?  If so what if less popular and/or smaller market teams like say the Bills,  Titans or Chargers (not small market but Los Angeles could care less about them), can't get enough subscribers to be profitable and have to fold.

TO be frank, I've gone a decade without cable and when I'm around it (friend/family's house, hotel, etc.) it legitimately gives me anxiety from the need to channel surf, even with a guide, because the options are pretty slim.

Eventually, try out the free trials of SlingTV, Playstation Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu Live, and other streaming services that do live cable channels (if you still desire live cable channels). You may find that cable channels no longer hold any value for you. 

Except maybe you still want certain live sports or local TV news, and you subscribe to a specific service just for sports, and buy an antenna to get free over-the-air network channels that also have local TV news. If you're very lucky, your local news station has a Roku channel for streaming live or pre-recorded news reports.

Find out if you have a monthly data cap set by your Internet provider. Learn how to monitor your data usage... probably through your ISP's website with a report showing usage up to the previous day. You may need to pay more per month to increase or eliminate the data cap.

You can configure your Netflix account to reduce the video quality and thus reduce your data usage, but this isn't an option for all streaming services. If you're becoming a cord cutter, you'll need a high data cap or no data cap. How high? It depends on how often you stream, hence the need to monitor your usage and get a feel for what's happening.

I almost lost my job 6 months in because I had not met that single metric, of 4 main ones, to keep my job.
So I found a creative way to make cable sound like something else, while still describing exactly cable, to sell it. And it works.

They also raise the bar so high that legit reps have to get shady too, get really good, or quit.

Philo also allows for app sign in on most channel apps,a lot more than sling. And unlike Sling, at least with the apps I used, using channel apps doesn't use up a stream.

Check your OS updating and app updating. If people use Facebook, twitter etc or have email being checked by their devices, set them to update and check less frequently. For mobile devices, check the video settings. Given the size of the screen, it may be fine to use a lower video setting. Auto settings often using the highest quality which can eat alot of data.

Here is what Plex indicated as far as limits are for the Shield as a Plex server on encoding:

When Plex needs to transcode video to be compatible for an app or device, it always transcodes video to H.264. The NVIDIA SHIELD supports hardware accelerated H.264 encoding.

When content needs to be transcoded, the server will also need to decode the video stream before transcoding it. The following video compression formats are supported for hardware decoding on the SHIELD:

H.264

H.265 (HEVC)

MPEG 2

This means that if your media uses one of the above three formats, then the NVIDIA SHIELD will be able to make full use of hardware acceleration for transcoding. If your content is in another source format (e.g. VC-1, Xvid, VP9, etc.) then the SHIELD will have reduced performance in cases where transcoding is necessary.

(My wireless is garbage because I have so many neighbors.) From there I added the app to my Fire devices and it works great. The Antenna + Tablo set up doesn't even have to be near a TV since the Tablo doesn't actually plug into one.

*Ironically of all the many antennas I have bought, this cheap-ass set of rabbit ears I got at Target has worked the best.",1534009043
cordcutters,"No.  And that's a proven fact.  If people are willing to pay 50 million for a show, and only X amount for you, then they objectively, empirically, and scientifically produce more value to society than you do. 

You may want to BELIEVE you produced more value like everytime we try to sell our car or our house. 

 ""Well, to me its worth 5k."" 
""I'm only willing to pay 3.5k""
""But....(emotional plea based on personal attachment)
""Sorry, only going to pay 3.5k.""
""But......its WORTH more than that."" 
""Its only worth what someone is willing to give you for it.  I'm willing to give you 3.5k and that's your best offer.""
""Ok."" 

You have totally removed yourself from reality in this post.  The value these people are creating aren't going to keep planes up in the sky.  But is society wanted more aerospace engineers, they would place a higher monetary value on it.  They don't because the planes we are currently running are doing a decent job at it. 

You may as well have said 'public school teachers', in there, at least you would have gotten an emotional plea from some people.  

But economically wise, society had spoken.  We have all the safe planes and aerospace engineers we need right now, and on another topic, we as a society are willing to pay X amount for quality entertainment centered around Star trek.

cordcutters,"For my needs PS Vue works well.  Sports is a big focus and it covers all the sports I need including regionals for the $50 Core plan.  And for this time of year it has the option to add NFL Redzone.  While some other services may sound cheaper in the base plans. Often by the time you upgrade to get Fox Sports regionals NFL network etc.  you are paying more.  The base 40 DTV Now for example jumps to at least $55 (maybe $65 if you want NBA TV) and doesn’t include all the for example with DTV Now with 3 less streams than $50 Vue.   YouTube TV covers sports well for $40.  But it was missing must haves for the wife like HGTV that Vue included and did not have NFL network which I want this time of year.  Of course if you don’t care much about sports none of that matters.

Vue prices include things like 5 streams 28 day unlimited DVR, the ability to pause and rewind live TV (which options like DirecTV Now do not have) all included for that price.  Where most others upcharge to have more than 1 or 2 simultaneous streams or to have a DVR.  If you are perhaps single and don’t need lots of streams or don’t use DVR much you may not care.  But if you have a large family where multiple people are streaming it’s a consideration.  

Also I find Vue and YTTV to be the most technically sound and reliable (I don’t have much experience with Sling and Hulu Live though).  Like Vue YTTV includes an unlimited DVR which goes out to 9 months!  And it includes 3 streams free which while not as much as Vue, it’s more than most offer.  The biggest issue with Vue would be if they have your local channels.  In my area (Dallas) we are spoiled in that every service but Sling has ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox affiliates (Sling doesn’t have CBS at all) so you will want to see what locals are in your area if that’s important. 

DirecTV Now covers the most overall content so you will need to think about that.  Take that for what it’s worth though as if you only watch 7 channels regularly having others “just in case” may not matter.  One of the most common things that comes up is DirecTV Now and Sling (both owned by cable companies) have Viacom channels where YTTV, Vue, and Hulu currently don’t.  There are ways around that though. adding $16 Philo can fill the Viacom gap for example.  Or I’ve found the little Viacom content we watched is available on free apps not needing a sign in.  That’s something you will need to evaluate.",1534967520

cordcutters,"TL;DR: The ""hacked dish"" antennas are a lot of work for little to no improvement.  Just take the dish off the mount, and put an antenna on it's mount, and take the time to aim it well.  You'll have the same, or even better, results.

Long version:  DirecTV dishes are the size and shape required to receive DirecTV signals, not OTA signals.  If you do the modification perfectly and aim it perfectly, you're going to get, at best, a slight (1-2 db) gain over using just the antenna itself.  Which is almost nothing.  Considering the time it takes to do the modification and to properly aim it, it's a complete waste of time and energy.  And if you screw it up by even a centimeter or two, you're actually reducing the effective gain of the antenna.

The people who say ""OMG it's amazing I get 9284892 channels"" are probably either comparing it to their indoor antenna, or to no antenna at all.  If they did a side-by-side comparison between the hacked dish vs. the same antenna mounted to the dish's arm, they'd all see almost no improvement (if not a reduction of channels received).

For some people, pure OTA is enough. If that works for you, that's awesome. But to think that it will/should work for everyone is not a valid argument. There are a lot of great shows on basic cable stations, premium stations, add-on services like Netflix, etc. Some people want them and are willing to pay for them.

As mentioned earlier, what makes the HDHR service unique is how they deliver the content, giving even more control and flexibility.

I was googling for ISPs and ran across an initiative on the official utility board site to start offering community broadband in the city and surrounding areas. This is all pending a feasibility study being conducted by a third party company that specializes in that type of infrastructure.

It all stemmed from fed up denizens of the area voicing opinion to the local government and the utility board. The only thing you may need to watch out for when starting the initiative is criminal law that the state has in place to prevent community ISPs from forming.

For context, the city is Lenoir City, and they launched the survey at the end of April. Still no update but I'm going to reach out to the utility board to see where they are in the process.

Also, to note, Lenoir City currently has 83 miles of fiber laid in the immediate town area. It isn't available in most of the other zip codes outside of downtown.

Now I’m pretty happy with YouTube TV. Only drawback is that it uses internet for locals instead of antenna. My internet is uncapped so data usage isn’t a big deal, but antenna quality is slightly better. Easy accessibility to both live channels and hundreds of recorded shows offsets that, though. 

I spent many years as a content hoarder, recording and storing season-after-season of favorite shows. Lately I’ve come to realize that there’s just so much to watch that it’s not worth keeping older stuff. I can always find something on Prime, Netflix, etc. ",1535315464
cordcutters,"I'm not really interested in something that straight up replaces cable. I think the ideal for me would be something that combines the CW app and CBS All Access. If each network offered an app that allowed you to watch the most recent episodes with ads for free, like CW, but also offered a paid subscription that gave you ad-free and access to full season and their back catalog, I would support that.

I don't mind watching the CW app. Sure, there's ads, but I can pause, and the ad breaks are still shorter than during broadcast. I can watch the episodes the day after they air, and as long as I don't fall behind I can watch the season as it airs.

If each network did that ad-supported and free, I would be more willing to pay them to see older episodes and catch up on their other shows that I haven't seen. How much I'd be willing to to pay for a premium version would depend on what they offered in their back catalog. I might binge watch a few shows on one service while I had it for a few months, then cancel and use something else for a while.

&gt; The Federal Communications Commission last year required Verizon and other carriers to file maps and data indicating their current 4G LTE coverage. The information will help the FCC determine where to distribute up to $4.5 billion in Mobility Fund money over the next 10 years. The funds are set aside for ""primarily rural areas that lack unsubsidized 4G,"" the FCC says.

&gt; The Mobility Fund is part of the FCC's Universal Service Fund, which is paid for by Americans through fees imposed on phone bills.

[Universal Service **Fund**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund)

&gt; The Universal Service **Fund** (USF) is a system of telecommunications ***subsidies and fees*** managed by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) intended to promote universal access to telecommunications services in the United States. The FCC established the fund in 1997 in compliance with the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC is a government agency that implements and enforces America’s communication regulations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and other U.S. territories. The fund reported a total of $7.82 billion **in disbursements** in 2014, divided among its four programs. The **fund** is supported by **charging telecommunications companies a fee** which is set quarterly. As of the third quarter of 2016, the rate is 17.9% of a telecom company's interstate and international end-user revenues.

Crunchyroll has three tiers free, premium, and a higher level premium.

They say the html5 player is in beta, but its been in beta for years and almost every other website uses html5 so it really should not be in beta any longer.  Also all mobile devices use the html5 player as flash does not work on phones or tablets.  So the html5 player is clearly working without a hitch.

I never said you prefer cable boxes. I said you prefer cable box UI's, which YTTV and DTVN resemble.

Hulu isn't pricey if you consider what you get, that you get more than what the others offer, see my other reply about that.

With those fast speeds, Hulu doesn't buffer on the ATV. I have a slower 50/5 connection, and zero issues on my ATV with Hulu or Vue or DTVN buffering.

cordcutters,"Definitely, and it has been on the decline for decades.  There used to be the Big Three (then Fox came along) and that is how everyone watched their shows.  Then cable came along, and then cable expanded. Now we have the internet.  Some people get their cable from the internet via DTVN, YTTV, Sling and others, but not all of those services have locals and many people don't want to fuss with an antenna or can't receive the stations.  Plus services like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, and others are taking away eyeballs from broadcasts.  Also video games have exploded into an industry bigger than the movie industry and that takes away eyeballs from traditional TV not just broadcast TV.  the Cable industry is trying to adapt by selling their product through services like Vue and Philo but it is a little more complicated for the locals and that is to their detriment. It is very interesting to watch this shift as it happens. ",1533863098

Excerpt: "" Another aspect of the deal is that it only includes ad-supported on-demand rights, not commercial-free SVOD rights which are part of Disney’s deals with Starz (for *The Force Awakens*) and Starz’s successor Netflix for the next *Star War*s films. It remains to be seen if viewers, who are used to streaming movies with no ads, will embrace watching *Star Wars* with commercials on demand.""",1533378865

Wouldn't they already be satisfied by existing satellite ISPs then, anyway?

&gt; Up to a point, but now you're putting satellites over the poles again, which is what you just wanted to avoid.

Not necessarily.  I was thinking of clustering the satellites both latitudinally and longitudinally.

&gt; It costs $750M/year just to maintain ~24 GPS satellites. It's almost always cheaper to install ground broadband infrastructure to a home than the satellite infrastructure.

How much of that cost is ground infrastructure vs satellites?  How much of that cost has to do with the military requirements surrounding GPS?

I know SpaceX is due to start launching new GPS satellites, but I doubt they are part of the cost structure for launching and maintaining the existing system.  GPS satellites also are around 12,000 miles up, vs around 750 miles for the LEO satellites being proposed.

Another argument specifically in SpaceX's favor is that they have driven down the cost of accessing space considerably, and they could conceivably afford themselves of their own launch services at cost.

Again, SpaceX is not the only company looking to do this.  So we can't do the math simply based on their numbers.  Likewise, if they decide the business works for them, I don't see why they couldn't launch more satellites as utilization increases.",1534272961

cordcutters,"If he's talking about [this](https://www.att.com/internet/fixed-wireless.html), then $60/mo with a 170GB/mo cap and $10 per 50GB overage fees. If wired is absolutely not an option in your area it's pretty good compared to satellite. 

But personally I'd go with the 3Mbps wired option if it doesn't have caps and is stable. At a secondary residence I have 2.5Mbps for $40/mo and it's perfectly usable for streaming video as long as you can live with 480p-720p video quality. And there's no cap so I can max it out at night to download things offline.

cordcutters,"So is good RG-11 cable, which is about the only thing that would keep the losses to a minimum (inline amplifiers can cause problems of their own, especially if there are any strong TV/FM/2 meter signals nearny), and on the higher UHF channels even RG-11 will be somewhat lossy at that distance.  Plus, fiber won't carry lightning from one building to another.  If you do run coax between buildings you are supposed to have good lightning arrestors at both ends, and those can get expensive too.  Meanwhile the cost of running fiber has fallen a bit over the years.

Most of the resistance to running fiber is because it's unfamiliar and people doubt their ability to do it.",1535232816

cordcutters,"I concur. I've used YTTV, PSVue, DTVNow, and Hulu w/ live TV. YTTV is by far the best out there. I use Hulu w/ no commercials in conjunction to watch shows from networks that aren't available. Works great for me and my family. While the DVR changes were a deal-breaker for some, for me it's still a non-issue. It mainly affects only the bigger networks with primetime shows and even then you have about an hour or so before being switched to the VOD version.

In regards for Smart TV OS vs streaming device. Definitely go with the ATV. You'll receive timely updates, a better remote and various codecs (Dolby Atmos, Vision, HDR10, and etc).

As for your internet I've got Comcast too. If you're not in a contract, I would look into signing up as a new customer. I've got the gigabit service for $70/mo currently w/ my own modem and router. You can get 100/100 for $50 currently. Plans of course depend on the rates in your area.

cordcutters,"For the longest time, the YTTV had the advantage of being a better video service than Hulu. Hulu would buffer all the time while YTTV wouldn’t buffer at all. But that has basically been resolved on hulu’s End so it comes down to the content of Hulu vs the features of YTTV, which I think Hulu wins out on pretty easily. 

Hulu with Live Tv can come with its no commercial streaming library (basically no commercials except like 5 or 6 ABC shows that have contractual obligations) for 43.99 I believe. The channel selection is also wider on Hulu. 

The one biiiig advantage of YTTV is that it comes with unlimited DVR while Hulu comes with 50 hours in its plan, with the option to go to 200 for 15 dollars (not worth it). However, I think Hulu’s DVR storage will expand as the service matures, though i doubt itll have have unlimited like YTTV as that is backed by Google. This problem is mitigated a bit by the fact that a lot of the stuff you might be recording will be on Hulu’s streaming catalog. 

You can skip commercials on all DVR stuff for both. 

Looking into the future, I’m pretty sure Hulu will be the better overall option. You’ll probably be able to bundle with that Disney VOD and ESPN+ service for a cheaper price with Hulu, if that interests you at all.

But, today I picked up a Shield TV and have a Roku Ultra arriving tomorrow. Noticed the clients are vastly different than on my Samsung(tizen2016) tv or Tivo Bolt (white). Better.

cordcutters,"Well most services cover all except Comedy Central because of the Viacom situation.  Of the main OTT options only Sling and DirecTV Now (owned by cable companies) still carry Viacom.  I've heard that Viacom may be willing to start working with OTT again soon, but it hasn't happened yet. Depending on how much you watch on Comedy Central, the free app might cover your needs without sign in including stuff like the last full week of the ""Daily Show"", but of course you have to deal with some ads.  Many people use $16 Philo to fill the Viacom channel gap (YTTV+Philo is pretty popular) you should be able to record and skip commercials.  Also while HBO and Showtime are available elsewhere, DTV Now certainly has a price advantage over most (AT&amp;T owning HBO probably helps!)

PS Vue's Ultra plan includes HBO and Showtime and is only missing Comedy Central.  At $80 it might sound expensive, but it includes all available channels including HBO/Showtime. Alternatively you could do the $45 basic, add HBO for $15 and Showtime for $11 (or $9 if you are a PS Plus subscriber) and get everything from between $69 and $71.  Recording and skipping commercials aren't an issue, except for any Fox network, on Vue (and maybe everyone) you are forced into On-Demand as soon as it's available (would affect FX) after like a day or so.

With YTTV again you have everything but CC. You can add Showtime to YTTV for $11 but for HBO you'd have to do HBO Now separately.  The big issue with YTTV is I understand almost all recordings move to the On-demand version (unskippable commercials) pretty quickly except of course for live stuff like sports.  So it's not just for Fox networks, but ALL of them from my understanding so if that's a big deal that may rule them out.  But add it all together with HBO and Showtime you are talking $66.

I haven't tried Hulu with Live TV, but I think they are missing AMC as well as CC from your list.  So they are probably out.",1533743218

The Stream+ is pretty good. You can side load both Netflix and Prime. Netflix took over a year to approve the same device used in Australia by Foxtel for streaming only; they have changed how freely they give their streaming rights out now that they are dominant in the market. There is an active beta group for Google Live Channels and there is the promise to reveal the full 14 day guide (right now it's there, but you can only see 48 hours). The main disadvantage is you cannot start to record a program and then start watching the recording in delay mode (""chase play""). You can also use the HDhomerun app as a channel input so the channels are integrated with your other sources like Pluto TV.

Some people are using the hard drive attached to the S+  as the storage for the HDHR $35 a year DVR. That's been problematic for me as it keeps disconnecting the drive if the internet goes down.

The HDHR DVR works well and stores the files as regular mp4 files. But it has a weird 14 day guide that is a little quirky. I'm learning to like it, though.

cordcutters,"Well if that's all that you did it would be less competitive. But if you could use the newly vacated infrastructure, vacated via a sale like NY is doing, and require the top bidder to make the network open access to any ISP (like how Sweden does it) we would have much more service level competition. Or alternatively, require that that company go open access if they want to keep their license to do business in CA. 

&amp;#x200B;

The owner of the open access network would be allowed to charge commercially reasonable rates for wholesale access to the network (essentially enough to cover upgrade costs/repayment of debt to purchase the network) and then different ISPs would buy bandwidth to sell to retail consumers. These ISPs would compete on price and service quality.  I could go so far to say that it would be okay in this situation if ISPs chose to charge different prices based on data caps, throttling etc. because consumers would at least have a choice to opt out or in based on the price of the service. As it is now, lack of competition means you take what they're offering our you're screwed. 

&amp;#x200B;

The beauty of this plan is that if it worked we wouldn't even need net neutrality rules, the ISPs aren't wrong when they say that competition (in theory) obviates the need for rules banning paid prioritization, throttling, blocking etc. but we simply don't have the competition necessary to enforce anti-consumer behavior.

&gt; Roku announced today that its free, ad-supported streaming service, The Roku Channel, is now available on the web for viewing on PCs, tablets, and smartphones.

&gt; After creating a Roku account on TheRokuChannel.com, you can start streaming the movies, TV shows, and short videos that the service offers.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s pretty barebones in terms of features and design, but it&amp;#039;s an easy way of finding something very random to watch - and The Roku Channel certainly helps Roku increase its number of user accounts and grow its ad business.

My complaints are: (1) There just really isn't a whole lot of programming on NBC, CBS, FOX, ABC, and PBS that I'm interested in. YMMV with that one. (2) Setting up the antenna was kind of a pain.

I won’t say everything is awesome but I’ve gotten immersed in many series and movies from them. Even some of the foreign series have been great, like Dark, I just use the CC option. To be honest I keep that on all the time now even for English shows/movies. Some of them can have some strong accents that make having it on nice to know for sure what was said otherwise I can easily ignore it. I’ll admit that finding something new to watch can be daunting because 1. There is so much I see that I may like and 2. The different genre selections and menu set up make it hard to search and don’t even show you everything they have available, it’s based off each profile.

To get a steady signal on your tv you need 35nmdb at the TV 

to figure that out you add your antenna strength to the nmdb rating on TV Fool which is the 5th column in

&amp;#x200B;

so you should be getting quite a few baltimore and dc stations with a very basic rabbitears antenna

rabbit ears antennas can get UHF and VHF signals VHF is when the channel number is under 14 on your tvfool Column 2 - REAL and not column 3 Virtual which is the channel your tv displays it on.

&amp;#x200B;

I would try putting your antenna near a window or the outside wall of your house if you can and on the side of the house that signal is coming from if you can so northwest and southwest not on the east side especially if you are in a concrete or brick home... 

&amp;#x200B;

so read your nmdb signals and you should be able to get down to WETA WNVC maybe

if not you can try something like this without the amplifier

Vue also has Scripps channels (HGTV for the wife) and with YTTV I'd have to add Philo.  It's nice to know that Vue has up to 5 streams with a family, though YTTV's 3 is enough most of the time.  Also YTTV turning most recordings to on-demand versions quickly is annoying, Vue only does this on Fox networks.  Lastly I'd need to get more hardware for YTTV since it won't work on my Fire TV or my PS4, just my apple TV.  So I'd have to buy 2 of something (either Apple TV or Roku) to have it run on all my TVs.

I have DirecTV Now last because of lower reliability and less functionality.  It only comes with 2 streams (you cna pay for a 3rd) and you can't pause live TV which sucks for sports in that I can't rewind to see a big play I just missed.

This is what AT&amp;T was successfully sued by the FTC for - they specifically did *not* inform customers that there was cap on ""full speed"" data, which is why carriers now spell out the terms. 

Consider a standard 22GB ""full speed"" plan. If your 4G speed is 6MB/s and your 3G speed is 0.3MB/s, that means in a 30 day cycle you can download a total of 35GB, at an average speed of 0.8MB/s. I think we can both agree that carriers would happily offer such a shitty plan and that such a plan would not be 'more unlimited' (or preferable) than the current model simply because the speed is constant. 

Look, it sucks, but it beats paying an extortionate amount per mb when you go over your limit (like $0.50/mb), which is what used to happen - and net neutrality will not fix that because carriers now disclose the full speed cap, which customers agree to when they sign a contract.

""The other issue is around the definition of cord cutting. The industry defines a cord cutter as someone who completely abandons any sort of pay TV subscription in favor of on-demand only services like Netflix and/or old school over the air broadcasts.

The problem is that the people creating the “TV is dead” narrative don’t differentiate between cord cutting and a more common behavior known as cord shifting.""

""A cord shifter is someone who has given up linear pay TV delivered via a set-top box for linear pay TV delivered via the open internet. So rather than Comcast or Verizon or Dish, they’re getting their linear TV from services like Hulu, YouTube TV, DirecTV Now, Sling TV, FuboTV, PlayStation Vue and the like.""

""A [recent study](https://www.fiercecable.com/cable/cord-cutting-slows-as-conversion-rate-to-vmvpds-improves) by the Wall Street analyst firm MoffettNathanson revealed that around 70 percent of those giving up their traditional pay-TV subscriptions are actually switching to these vMVPDs. And if you’re paying AT&amp;T $60/month to watch 80 channels worth of live network TV on DirecTV Now, that’s not really cutting the cord—it’s shifting it from cable or satellite to broadband.""

""From a consumer POV, these virtual services are actually a better experience than traditional cable, regardless of price. They provide a true TV Everywhere experience, with the same line-up and interface available across devices and the ability to start watching on one device and then finish watching on another, days later.""

""But those are challenges, not death knells, and for now, the TV industry isn’t going anywhere. It’s changing and adapting and reinventing, but the one thing it isn’t doing is dying. No matter how many clicks those sorts of headlines can accrue.""

That isn't conspiracy, that's called business.  

If they wanted to really compete they would put everything we have for tv and movies out there readily available to watch but things are restricted, owned by different companies and they didn't ""accidently"" start making all of their own versions of online a la CBS All Access, NBC Sports, etc. etc. etc.

cordcutters,"AT&amp;T I’m sure will sell its stake, but I’m hoping Disney and Comcast can come to a co promise and work on Hulu together. Maybe split it up 50/50.  Hulu’s growth is very, very encouraging and I don’t think it’s wise for Comcast to give up a 30% share within the company. 

They are also not going to get a better opportunity for streaming than Hulu. While Disney can successfully launch its own service due to its enormous backlog of desirable content, no way can Comcast do the same through Universal. It just doesn’t have near the same recognition. Comcast is also not making any effort for an OTT TV service, and I think they’re too late now to make a realistic push. 

Hulu is still growing, but I’ve day it will be an enormously profitable company and losing 30% of the revenue (and more If they come to a compromise) would be bad.

- Subscribe to Netflix DVD for 7/month and when new seasons are released, rent the DVD or Bluray to watch it

- If your favorite shows are on free TV (ABC, CBS, NBC, CW, FOX) then you can watch the shows directly off antenna  or the phone app.  Free TV seasons typically start in September and end in May (so basically the standard school year)

Considering Disney just bought Fox, its going to take a ton of work at the federal level (more work than most people care to do) to reverse course on that.  You're more than welcome to try but in all honesty, not enough people care to make it an issue.

&gt;Cable is kind of refusing to innovate at the moment

I'll give them a *tiny* bit of credit in that they are trying to move towards streaming options without a cable box and stuff like that.

Next thing to try if is dsl and has a line filter inside like Fairpoint used to use (looks like long beige telephone adapters/spilters about 3 in long), ask them to send you a replacement one (or two or three).

The bigger issue is your monthly data cap. You will need to monitor your usage the first few months to know if you're close to going over the cap and incurring additional fees. You can usually do this when logged into your Internet provider's website.

Check out AT&amp;T's [data estimator](https://www.att.com/esupport/data-calculator/index.jsp). Ignore everything except the hours spent streaming SD/HD/4K video. All other things you'll do on the Internet are trivial compared to streaming video.

Think about how many hours of TV you watch per day, then calculate the total for a month, and adjust the calculator. For example, 3 hours of HD video per night is 90 hours per month which the estimator says is 225 GB needed for the month.

https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) 1 hour of HD video uses up to 3 GB per hour. 3 GB x 90 hours = 270 GB per month. Of course, Netflix used the qualifier 'up to.'

If you're only streaming Netflix, then hurrah, because Netflix will let you downgrade your stream to 'medium' and 'low' quality to save on your data usage.  A medium stream only uses 0.7 GB per hour and is tolerable.

Most other streaming services do not let you downgrade your data stream. But if you use a Roku box, you can throttle all streaming via a secret menu.

cordcutters,"&gt;    Can anything other than the Tablo stream the same antenna to multiple TVs without buying lots of additional expensive DVR-specific devices?

HDHomerun can, but it doesn't have DVR capability in and of itself; you'll have to add separate DVR hardware/software, whether that's their in-house DVR system, Plex DVR, NextPVR, Emby, or what have you.

&gt;    Can any of them (I think Tablo can?) stream either live or DVR to a device outside the home network?

The best non-Tablo solution for this would most likely be Plex DVR.  

&gt;    I read that the Tablo Dual 2-tuner version can stream to 6 devices at the same time. Does this mean that each device could watch a different show, or is it the same show to each device? Does the # of tuners only matter for recording? I thought you basically needed 1 / TV.

The tuners are used for recording and live viewing.  The Tablo can stream to up to 6 devices at once, but it can only view and/or record as many channels simultaneously as it has tuners (2 for the Dual, and 4 for the Quad).  Any additional devices would need to either be watching the same channel, or watching recordings.

Given your list of requirements, I think Tablo works best for you.  Plex would be my second choice, mostly because initial setup is more difficult (it's not just one integrated package) and their guide setup is confusing as all fuck (they are introducing a more standardized grid-based guide, but AFAIK it's not out for Roku yet).",1533825679

- DirecTV Now: Consistently slow interface.  Scrolling slow.  Time to display a new show/recording slow.  One positive is that the DirecTV Now account allows you access to full use of a lot of app based streaming
- Netflix: Always seems to work.  Only negative is that it doesn't have the same content as the streaming TV services

I'm using a Roku Ultra on Ethernet.  Best streaming box I've used so far, so I think it gives a fair comparison of what these services are capable of.  When I first cut cableTV, I was streaming on an original Chromecast.  Everything stuttered.  Make sure to get good, fast hardware.  Go with ethernet if you can.

I agree with the others here that suggest trying the trial versions.  Try every trial out there and see what you like.  You should also check to see what service has the channels you want.

As an alternate, you might want to get a digital antenna.  I see the absolute best video quality from digital antenna transmissions.  That satisfies all my local (i.e. sports) needs.  Cable and streaming can't touch the video quality you get over a digital transmission.",1533661721

&gt; Call me an optimist, but I&amp;#039;ve never been convinced by the idea that cord cutting will leave consumers in worse shape than they were with cable TV. We&amp;#039;ve heard a lot of arguments to that extent over the years.

&gt; Cord cutting&amp;#039;s naysayers have told us that streaming TV gives people too many choices, won&amp;#039;t actually save money, will wipe out quality programming, and could even cripple the internet, all to imply that we should be careful about wishing for cable&amp;#039;s decline.

&gt; That&amp;#039;s more than double the amount that aired in 2010, and most of the growth in the past few years has come from streaming services, which alone put out 117 series in 2017.Jared Newman / IDG. It&amp;#039;s true that streaming services have lost some content along the way.

cordcutters,"Best recommendation was already posted.  And summarized in a citation posted by u/WarpSeven.  Never find a solution in some magic piece of hardware.   Protection is the item that harmlessly absorbs hundreds of thousands of joules.  As already defined: a connection to and quality of single point earth ground.

Code already defines what must exist on an OTA antenna.  That antenna must already have a hardwire connection to earth.  And the antenna's lead must enter the house at the service entrance to make a low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection to 'single point earth ground'  (all four words have electrical significance).

Why is a 'single point earth ground' at the service entrance?  Because every wire inside every incoming cable must make that same low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) connection to the one earth ground.  Either directly (ie TV cable, OTA antenna).  Or via a protector (ie telephone, invisible dog fence, AC electric).

A tech note demonstrates what every structure (residential, commercial, military) does to have surge protection:
https://www.erico.com/catalog/literature/TNCR002.pdf

If a wire interconnects two structures (two buildings or a building and antenna tower), then all wires that interconnect those two structures must connect to the single point earth ground for each structure.  Underground wires are at risk just like overhead wires.

OP did many things wrong.  For example, he had many plug-in protectors.  Those can even make surge damage easier. 

Unfortunately many are educated by hearsay and advertising.  Therefore do not demand facts with numbers - another mistake.  Protectors without earth ground are routinely hyped to such consumers.  So, for example, many will buy an in-line coax protector.  Then believe it will magically 'block' what three miles of sky cannot.

That coax protector is effective when it does not 'block' or 'absorb' a surge.   Those many plug-in protectors must somehow (magically) 'block' or 'absorb' a surge.  It will never happen.  That coax protector can be effective when connected to what does all protection - single point earth ground. Those plug-in protectors can never be effective - must never be connected low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point earth ground.

OP only assumed a surge was incoming on an OTA antenna.  Also likely, a surge was a direct lightning strike maybe many blocks down the street to AC electric.  That surge was incoming to everything.

Was everything damaged?  Of course not.  Only damaged are items that make a best outgoing connection to earth.  If both *incoming* and *outgoing* paths do not exist, then no electricity and no damage.  Damage existed because a surge was all but invited inside.

If the OP did not have a properly earthed 'whole house' solution, then plug-in protectors gave that AC electric surge even more destructive paths to earth - made surge damage easier.

What should have almost all your attention?  Earth ground.  Protector either is a connecting device to earth ground.  Or that protector does nothing useful.  His first mistake was to buy so many plug-in protectors (and not spend tens of times '*less*' money on earthing a 'whole house' protector.  Second mistake was to not properly earth that in-line coax protector.

Any and all protectors - a protector is only as effective as its earth ground.  One item might be purchased: many ten foot long earthing electrodes.  But those should already exist as also required by codes that only protect humans.

For images we're only going to develop more efficient codecs as time goes on. JPEG is a great example of an antiquated codec that is already outdone by things like webp and jpeg2000. 

Videos are a special case because an uncompressed movie would be hundreds of gigabytes on the low end. Compression is necessary for most people to even store them. However even that is going to get more efficient over time as better codecs are developed. A 1080p movie encoded in h.265 is going to be a smaller size than a comparable quality h.264 encode.

The lifetime subscription is account based so you can transfer it if you replace/upgrade your Tablo in the future.

There are programs for ripping your recordings from the Tablo, so you can at least archive those onto a Plex/Emby server if you wanted to. As for third-party app support for live streams, it's a shame there isn't any, but with Tablo being on most devices/platforms already it's not a big deal.

Loading channels is slow due to the transcoding and buffering, but I'm already used to VOD so I just skim through the guide or show listings to find things to watch/record.

Image quality is fine, especially if you choose a higher quality option in the settings and 5.1 audio support was recently added, although there are compatibility issues that need to be taken into account if you want to use it.

As I said before, yeah you'll have to replace your Tablo when ATSC3.0 finally rolls out, but that will still take years, and your lifetime subscription will carry over.

This is why I suggested before companies go gung-ho on  implementing 5G to make a quick buck, they need to do more investigating how what it does to people. If people complain about it in the areas, it needs to be looked at or tweaked as to prevent issues. I'm referring to headaches and other potential issues. Some of those issues are brain damage or cancer caused by electromagnetic radiation. More towers will be needed than 4G to make the system work. We know why they want to rush it out to market. $$$$. That's it, and for the FCC to allow it is cause for concern.",1534472048
cordcutters,"It's not against Apple's App Store rules. Apps are not allowed to directly accept credit cards for digital goods (e.g., a subscription fee) within the app. They also cannot use a credit card already on file somewhere else to charge for digital goods.

So if Netflix displayed a credit card form directly in the app or displayed a ""Renew Now"" button that charged a credit card that Netflix somehow has on file, then they would get kicked out of the App Store. This is exactly why it's not possible to subscribe to Amazon Prime, subscribe to an Amazon Channel, or buy/rent a movie/show within the Amazon Prime Video app.

There's no rule that says you can't tell the user how to subscribe outside of the app.",1534896005
cordcutters,"This article highlights a potential pain point that has been voiced by many on this sub...

&gt; Each new app or content library looks like a different channel to consider, and each one is essentially a premium cable offering that requires a separate subscription to view.

While this is good in theory; it allows you to pick and choose the content you want, (a pseudo à la carte experience, if you will), the downside is that picking and choosing could get relatively expensive. Sure, you’re not obligated to subscribe to each service each month but it creates further fragmentation where there will be hundreds of streaming platforms  to choose from. That may not be as welcomed as originally thought.",1534176293
cordcutters,"You are not going to like this answer..... You need the TMNGO app to do that, and in order to get that you need first a basic cable sub, then you need a premium channel sub, that gets you HBO, Showtime etc. Then and only then can you use TMNGO with your sub to watch the latest HBO shows. 

A better alternative if you only watch a couple shows, like say you mainly watch Game of Thrones or Westworld, you can go on Google Play Movies and TV and just buy the seasons  / episodes you want. An entire season is like 15-25$ so if you only watch 3-4 shows during the year its a fraction of the cost of the cable sub + premium channel sub (which usually is about 80$ a month).   So lets say you only watch 4 HBO shows, well that would cost you about the same as a single month of subscriptions. 

The shows you buy on Google Play Movies and TV are very accessible, You can watch them either through the playstore, the Google Play Movies and TV app or through YouTube itself. So you can access them from literally anything that can connect to the net. I bought the latest season of The Venture Bros to test it out, since the Adult Swim app in Canada is total crap... And I was quite impressed at how usable the service is.

That's never going to get better, but one thing has been consistent and that's their willingness to fix any problems with the actual program that people have.

cordcutters,"IMO: YouTube TV is best in class for their search function and user interface.  Their “unlimited DVR” is no longer best in class though because they convert the recording to On Demand after 24hrs. In their On Demand streams they force you to frequently watch repetitive ads, even if you already watched them but accidentally skip back too far.  They need to follow Hulu’s lead and at least offer a service upgrade to be able to skip commercials. 

PlayStation Vue on the other hand allows almost unlimited recording for up to 28-days and you can skip commercials   That’s included in all their service packages.  Their app is available on all my devices and their picture quality is best-in class.  ",1534176759
cordcutters,"37 here. What constitutes a good UI will be subjective.

It’s missing enough channels that our family watches (Discovery suite of channels, A&amp;E, Hallmark, just to cover a few) where $40 is too much compared to Vue or Hulu. Again the DVR to VOD flip makes their DVR a less capable DVR that the 9 months can’t offset. This is not a fringe view, thus why many always mention a Philo supplement when recommending YTTV.

All streamers provide you access to those apps, Roku is not special here. The Roku is just lower on the spec side, thus has the cheaper price comparatively, and the marketshare as a result. This is also why I think it has issues others do not. I like my Dolby Vision and Atmos capabilities on my ATV. This plays a role in cost and ROI. Still, the consistent problems and issues the Roku has for many users, in the various streaming subs, seem more common than on other boxes like the ATV. My personal experience has been as such as well.

cordcutters,"That's fair and I'm annoyed too. I suppose I'm just used to it by now, but in their defense, the intentional blocking off movies hasn't happened too often in the past, and the theaters forced their hand on this one. I get the frustration though. I've had my fair share of blow-ups with them. Once they had this system with a limited amount of tickets per REGION not per theater, and on any given weekend, once those tickets were used, the app would shut out. That meant that unless you were going to a matinee on a Friday, you were paying for an app that literally did nothing and that was when it was $35/month. I got so mad and complained so much that I ended up talking with the then president of the company. He apologized and spoke with me on the phone for about a half an hour, recognizing the error in logic with that method and explaining their end goal and growing problems. The next weekend, they changed the system back and got rid of the limited tickets per region. All that is to say that they are trying really hard to make it work. They're trying to make something great that everyone can benefit from and they are taking all of the risk. This idea has never been done before and there are people who don't want it to work, so moviepass is fighting an uphill battle at a loss, and really am they are asking for us our patience. I think the product and the company's aim is good enough to give them that much. I hope you do too, but understand where you're at. ",1533686907
cordcutters,"This was a concern of mine when I cut the cord and so far it's working out fine. I've never exceeded my data cap in the year or so I've been cable free.

I'm a gamer too and while I've typically always opted for physical copies anyway, I do like to download the Games with Gold and PS+ games every month which add up fast. I won't lie to you, you're going to have to exercise some restraint and planning when it comes to your game downloads and streaming time. 1TB a month is manageable but, like you said, it's still easy to go over if you're not careful.

I'm currently using Directv Now which, from what I understand, is the biggest data hog of the streaming services although I think Vue is not far behind (just the price you pay for that sweet sweet PQ). Depending on the month you're looking at about 33GB a day. I would just do a trial of Vue and don't even turn on the cable box for that week. Only use Vue and the other streaming services you typically use and then track how much you're using each day over the course of that free trial and extrapolate that over a month's time. It should give you a decent idea of how close to the cap you'll get and whether or not you need to take steps to reduce your data usage. We've had to be better about turning streams off when we leave the room, or switching over to antennae if we just want background noise. Online gaming doesn't really use much data, it's your girlfriend's netflix/hulu and the tv watching you guys do that's going to chip away at that cap fast. And of course you'll need to plan out your game downloads accordingly. If I know I'm not going to have a chance to play the game any time soon I'll hold off til later in the week when I can consciously make sure I'm shoring up some data over those few days to download it later on.

Like I said, it's going to require a bit of a lifestyle change, and honestly there's a bit of added stress monitoring your data usage every month. So do the trial and see how things go.",1535727155

I didn't do it often because movies are expensive and I have a nice TV at home and shelves full of videos.

I got moviepass because I am now a cripple and figured it'd get me out of the house and give me something to do in a nice warm theater in winter and a nice cool theater in summer. This worked. I'd take a taxi (uber, lyft) to the theater, get a slice of pizza across the street, see my movie, and go home. Usually alone. It was a nice afternoon out. 

But there are still only a handful of movies I want to see at all. There have been none in the last month, there's one I'm just sorta thinking about now.

The diapoles on a rabbit ear antenna may help with aiming since you don't have windows facing the correct way. You will need test locations and rescan every time you move it. This may take some patience and you may need to try a few models. Since you are close sometimes an indoor wall facing the correct way will still work depending on the building.

cordcutters,"Canadian streaming services are all owned by cablecos so they haven't invested the time/effort into making apps for a wide variety of devices because they don't want to encourage cord cutting.

They are focused on protecting their legacy business model while providing a basic minimum amount of alternatives so they can tell their boards they're doing 'something' about cord cutting and the request for 'TV Everywhere' apps.

While Roku has done a lot work in making it easier to create 'channels' for its platform, it has its own programming language. Fire TV, Android TV, &amp; Apple TV use more standard app programming languages, which make it easier to code/port apps.

There is little incentive for the companies like Bell that own apps like Crave to create a Roku channel because they know it has a large install base with cord cutters because of its low cost.

**TLDR: There are few official 'channels' for Roku from Canadian-owned streaming services and it's unlikely there will be anytime soon.**

However (and this is the only 'bright spot' on the horizon)... TCL is entering the Canadian market this fall w/ built-in Roku Smart TVs.

cordcutters,"&gt; Some say that properly grounding antennas may reduce the chances of a strike because it neutralizes static electricity build up that attracts ""feelers""

That concept is called ESE.  ESE manufacturers wanted their products listed in codes as Article 781. It was roundly rejected for good reason.  Rather then do research to prove such protectors are effective, instead, in 1998 they sued using expensive lawyers to intimidate the NFPA.  So the NFPA did a study (see Bryan Panel) that basically said the entire concept is bogus.  And that ESE manufacturer should first prove their devices in research studies.

Never happened.  Myth about discharging static to prevent lightning lives on with other fables and urban myths.

Routine are direct lightning strikes without damage. But that means a transient current must find a best path to earth without being anywhere inside.  Effective protection without damage even to a protector has been routine for well over 100 years.  Based in the same concepts demonstrated by Franklin over 250 years ago.  Effective protection is that well proven.  And, unfortunately, unknown to a majority of consumers.

MOVs have excessive capacitance; cannot be used on RF circuits.  A consumer must read specification number for a coax protector.  It should be 1 Ghz or higher - depending on its application.  And that protector does nothing useful if not hardwired low impedance (ie less than 3 meters) to single point earth ground.

Coax protectors never block (stop) lightning.  Nothing does.

Lightning is not capricious.  If a human makes a mistake, then lightning can be inside hunting for earth ground destructively via appliances.  If damage happens, an informed homeowner locates his mistake.

*****
&gt; Comcast has been able to buck the cord cutting trend so far thanks to its growing monopoly over broadband.

&gt; As a result, Comcast&amp;#039;s cord cutting losses have tended to be worse than other cable providers, especially satellite TV operators like Dish and DirecTV. But Comcast&amp;#039;s better numbers may not tell the full story.

&gt; Those losses would be more than double the 151,000 pay TV subscribers Comcast lost in 2017, suggesting that Comcast may not be quite as bulletproof to the cord cutting phenomenon as many analysts previously believed.

To help keep the network afloat in 2011, the city started charging $5.35 on electric bills just so they could afford bond payments.

”Pricing, channels, features and terms subject to change &amp; may be modified or discontinued at anytime without notice.” 

What they DID say was that anyone signing up for the GoBig promo at launch would get to keep that package for the going price of the Live a Little package, meaning if the Live A Little package goes up
by a specific amount that is the price people who are grandfathered in will pay. There was nothing deceitful or ""predatory"" in their fine print which was clearly stated from the start.

They did send out a notice alerting subscribers of the price increase in advance, Maybe you should check your emails more closely.

Other services also increased their pricing by $5 at the same time but for some reason no one whined about Sling or the other live TV services doing the same, instead everyone got their panties in a bunch over DTVN. For the record, when Sling launched they had a $15 promo and it's now up to $25. No service has ever said you get to keep the introductory price for LIFE, if that was the case we would all still be paying $50 for cable.

If $5 for over 100 channels is that big of a deal you can always cancel or try another service.

Still *nothing*. I just find this hard to believe. It seems like I'd at least see a weak signal from a channel or two (or three).  

My concern now is that if I go to the expense of buying a ""better"" antenna and paying someone to hook it up to the pole on my chimney where the old AM/FM antenna is currently mounted, I will get basically the exact same level of signal I'm currently getting with that antenna. I mean, there are videos on YouTube of people making HDTV antennas out of *paperclips*, for Heaven's sake.  ",1533565518
cordcutters,"When I was on the trial subscription, I could not scroll the channel guide past two days. Same thing when my trial subscription expired. With the subscription, you get access to a ""show"" guide which does seem to compile everything available in a two week window.

Without the subscription service, all that is available is ""manual"" record mode which sounds a lot worse than it is, however I have to use my iPhone to setup the recordings as the manual recording interface for my Apple TV and Roku are both hard to use. On my iPhone, I use the Tablo app, bring up the channel guide and just select the show I want to have recorded. It automatically fills in all the information about the show, and I also have the option to make it a recurring recording (like if some show is nightly or weekly at a particular time). This works absolutely fine for me as all my shows are scheduled programs. When I goto my Tablo through my Roku I just go right to Recordings-&gt;Most Recent, and all my shows are there.

There are a few things that are missing without the subscription. The DVR nicity of being able to just press ""Rec"" on a show and have it record isn't there -- although it is almost the same through the phone interface. There is no episode info stored with the show - e.g., an episode of the Simpsons will have a short description of the episode and keep episodes and season numbers sorted for you if you have a subscription. Without the subscription, recorded episodes just have a title (e.g., ""The Simpsons"") and the date and time they were recorded. With the sub, it keeps track of recording ""The Simpsons"" and not just an arbitrary date, time and channel. So with a sub, if The Simpsons are cancelled because of some live sporting event the Tablo won't record erroneously but if you are setup to manually record of course it will be a mislabelled program. If you are wanting to scrape all the sub-channels for reruns of shows that are not on a set schedule, you probably want the subscription (e.g., like ""Law and Order"" reruns, there is no real set schedule for them). Lastly, you do not get any of the show artwork without the subscription - it is something I could not careless about and honestly made the interface slightly slower. I'm fine with the text only interface you get when you go sub-less.

Let me know if you have any other questions.


Edit: In regards to the two-week channel guide - when you select to record a show (with a subscription service) it will show all the records coming up in ""Scheduled"" for the next two-weeks. There is also an interface for dealing with conflicts. Overall, I was not happy with that interface as there was no way to prioritize shows. The priority was always given to the show that was first added to the record schedule, and then subsequent shows that were added to the record schedule would not record if in conflict with that first show that was added. I had to resolve the same conflicts each week which was a pain, but at least there is an interface for it and it tells you there is a conflict. So yeah, it does seem to load two weeks of guide data, but I was limited to only seeing two days on the channel guide for whatever reason. Maybe that has changed since the last time I had a subscription (which was June).",1534190251

How much additional cost is there for these users, though? I mean, the theater is going to play the film whether there's 5 people or 50 people in the seats. 

Are we just talking about additional cleanup and wear and tear on the seats? It just seems minimal and it would be in the theater's best interest to try to fill those empty seats however they can since every empty seat is a loss of potential income.

You'd think it would be similar to how hotels offer deep discounts to fill empty rooms.

Then again, this is coming from someone who avoids theaters after not having a single good experience in one over the past 5+ years.

Somewhere along the line, cable and Hollywood declared war on us. The nuisance of boxes, and fees, then larded bills with no real programming content.

IMO, streaming didn't kill cable. Nor did the improvements in broadcast television. Cable (and Hollywood) would still be fighting a losing battle against people deciding ""Keep it"".

It's the cost, and the bother. They just aren't as important as they thought they were.

Once people make that jump - it's difficult to go back. Probably won't happen. No matter the incentives offered.

I guess there are some who attempt to recreate that which was thrown away. Doing that might get expensive. More expensive than the original charges. Maybe they were never ""cord cutters"" anyway?

Hollywood IS making fewer movies. And cable continues to lose subscribers. Perhaps that just Twiight Zone justice?


(shrug) Bills here went from $369/mo to ~$85/mo. We were 'full"" cable subscribers since 1982. Very reliable annuity. But their charges finally changed our behavior. Zero chance we'll ever sit for such charges again. Cold turkey is next if they attempt more shakedowns (not kidding).

cordcutters,"Oh man, I haven't heard ReplayTV in a Loooong time.  You made me nostalgic and I went to go see if anything is still going on with them.  It's sad to see all the old forums where people spent years trying to figure out how to keep them around after the switch to HD television.  People were arguing with each other over whether or not HD was even all that good, talking about how close to HD Replay was if they recorded through the S-Video port and letterboxed everything. One person said that HD was a fad that would go away bc we'd never be able to record very much in HD due to the size requirements, lol.  

They were a very dedicated bunch.  About the last post I saw in the AVS forums was in 2010 from someone replying to the last conversation that ended in 2007. He was still hanging on. To my surprise there are still a couple companies providing program guide data specifically for ReplayTV people. 

&gt;Have been pleasantly surprised by a Thinkpad 420 equipped with 2ea SSDs though. Just solid. NextPVR + 8ea OTA Homerun tuners. Everything dumps to an SSD where they are picked off by popcorn network media players. The media players (like all media players) are buggy, but the video chip they used is nice.

That's quite a setup! It's amazing that little Thinkpad can handle that many simultaneous streams and only use half the CPU!

&gt;The reason it is so difficult for you to find a simple recorder is because the industry wants it that way.

That is the truth.  Replay caught tons of flack over the commercial skipping and it was super easy to move recordings off it. Even Tivo had their own problems for making it too easy to skip over commercials. It's never been as easy since those days to just watch TV without hassles.",1535523412
cordcutters,"This [article on Spectrum TV Stream](https://www.techhive.com/article/3257229/streaming-services/spectrum-quietly-tries-a-la-carte-tv-streaming-but-restrictions-apply.html) might help you out. I am not sure that the Tennis Channel is available on it after reviewing the images in the article. I believe that folks have lost promo prices for internet when doing a trial of this service so be careful about that. 

It is going to be difficult to get sports and live streaming for under $25 a month. Only Sling TV is $25 or less. And I don't think any other service but DirecTV Now has the Tennis channel.

For under $25, your choices for live streaming are [ATT Watch TV](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/live#wiki_at.26amp.3Bt_watch_tv) which is either $15 or $20 depending on plan, [Philo](https://try.philo.com/) which is $16 or $20 depending on plan, or [CBS All Access](http://www.cbs.com/) for $5.99 which is obviously only CBS but does include a live stream of sports coverage from CBS too. ESPN+ may eventually cover tennis but as far as I can tell, not yet. Note that DirecTV Now and ATT Watch TV both offer discounts for those with qualified ATT mobile plans (in the case of ATT Watch TV, it is free for select unlimited mobile plans.) Philo is definitely great for those who don't watch sports - mostly entertainment channels but no locals. 

You may want to consider looking at the tennis schedule and signing up for DirecTV Now for half of a year and then picking up either Hulu or Netflix and CBS All Access for the remainder of the year.  You can use NewsON for local newscasts for free. 

Edit: Also look into [Tennis Channel Plus](https://tennischanneleverywhere.com/subscribe) which is on the Tennis Channel website. You need to find it out if it is an add on only for cable tv subscribers who have the Tennis channel or if it is a proper stand alone streaming service.

&gt;Stream over 1000 hours of live &amp; VOD including select ATP Masters 1000s, 500s &amp; 250s - All WTA rounds from Indian Wells, Miami &amp; Cincinnati – Up to 10 courts from Roland Garros. $99

Edit 2: from the help pages: 

&gt;""If I subscribe to Tennis Channel Plus, will I be able to watch live streaming of Tennis Channel?

&gt;A: No, You would still need to subscribe to Tennis Channel in your video package of channels and then authenticate through your cable or satellite provider for live streaming of Tennis Channel.""

So not sure if on demand tennis is available it for non cable subscribers.

If Amazon has carte blanche to stream licensed content as much as it wants, then adding Comcast viewers is trivial. If not, then Comcast just has to make it financially attractive to Amazon.

They also have more money to throw stuff around, because not everyone is interested in watching Female Shawshank (*you know what I mean*) or Kevin Spacey Doing Nasty Things (*pre-coming out as a molester*). As a result Netflix is throwing around a ton of money designed to touch many a person, like Silly Stupid Comedies (there are at least three Adam Sandler Netflix movies), Super Serious Dramas (Beast of No Nation for instance), Anime Designed to Appeal to 90s Guys (AICO, the Whales one), and food-based reality shows (*including one from Japan!*).

Considering most of these charges were made more than 120 days ago, the only option we really have is to write-off and honor just a portion of the charge. So for example, the merchant honored the original terms up until just this past month, so instead of writing off the whole $89.99 charge (or whatever it is they originally paid) we’ll honor the month of when the merchant changed the terms, which would be like around $20 or so when you do the math.

Hi guys,

The initial 5000 number comes from an internal rollout plan relating to servers and bandwidth at launch. The scaling plan which will kick off once we have verified real-world performance of every part of the system.

Nick

Edit:  
'Scalability is one of the hardest issues in providing Live media distribution, and it sounds like Silicon Dust is limiting the expansion of their Premium TV service, to have better management over Quality of Service than other Services have previously. Sling TV, DTVN, etc. have tried to outpace each other's expansion in the field, to the detriment of their subscribers. Silicon Dust obviously has a more responsible plan, and seems more interested in quality than quantity. Good choice.'

This exactly!",1534987448
cordcutters,"Some of that is due to ""bursting"" or ""speed boost"" or whatever buzzwords your ISP might use...  So like if you have a 50/50 connection, it might let the first 100mb or whatever of the content you are getting run at higher than your 50mb speed limit just to get a ""jumpstart"" on your video.  

It helps those with slower connections, since it allows you to start content right away without clicking play and needing to sit there for 30 seconds for the first part of the video load, but it also gives a false sense of things working fast, especially if your ISP throttles content afterwards.. so it would be fast initially, speedboost wears off, they realize it's a video, then starts to throttle...

It can also mess up things like YT where your speedboost makes YT think you can handle 1080p, but then when speedboost stops, your normal rate can't keep up so it has to buffer.

* Are these must-haves for you? I don't think YTTV carries these as of now. 
* Red Zone is $10/month add-on, can be cancelled at end of season.
* NFLN will exclusively air Ravens @ Bengals, Jets @ Browns, Eagles @ Jags, Texans @ Jets, and Browns @ Broncos. The remaining TNF games will also air OTA on FOX and stream on Amazon Prime.
* If you don't need Red Zone and can live w/o those games, then YTTV might be your best option.

If you *do* want either of those, then your next step is NBC/FOX/CBS: 

* Can you get these with an antenna? If you can, IMO that's the way to go. Even if you get them with Vue the picture quality is better and you're not on any delay. (The delay is not specific to Vue, any streaming service is going to have a 30-60 second lag.) 
* If you can't get them with antenna, then check if your local market for Vue gets them live.

To me it basically comes down to NFLN and RZ. If you want those, Vue is your cheapest and best option. If you don't care about them, YTTV might be a better, cheaper option for you.",1535728263
cordcutters,"This comes down to control over the content you want to watch. In general, most people are happy renting content from a service.

I wonder if most people don't care, per se, about a particular show when subscribing to a service and are interested in getting a certain volume of content for their money. They may want 1 or 2 shows the service offers and then subscribe and just consume whatever other stuff is on that service if it meets their needs.

I suggest that this indicates that many consumers aren't as particular about their media choices; they just want something to watch.

I've been a Spotify subscriber for a while. An album from one of my favorite artists had been removed from Spotify. It was at that point I realized that I didn't have control over the content that Spotify provided to me. So I bought the CD. The lesson I learned is that if I really like something, I shouldn't have 100% faith in the streaming service I'm subscribing to. I need to control my access to the content. (To be fair, I think Spotify does a great job. This particular album was also out of print on CD so I bought a used CD.)

If there's a show someone really likes, and watches over and over, unless they have it on Blu-Ray or DVD, they don't have control over the content. Purchasing the content via Amazon, Vudu, etc. provides better control, but ultimately, if Amazon needs to take it down and refund money because of some type of rights dispute, the ""owner"" is out of luck.

Another trend I'm seeing... there are some shows that are only available for purchase on Amazon/Vudu/Google Streaming. I can't buy some shows on Blu-Ray or even DVD. It makes me wonder if we're going to see more content become unavailable via physical media and only available via streaming. I don't like that trend. It forces me to be locked into an eco system for purchasing my digital titles. If that service goes out of business or whatever, or there's a network issue, I may lose access (even temporarily) to the content I paid for.",1534261384

cordcutters,"&gt; You can't really cluster it for certain times of day because it's LEO (orbit time is ~90-120 minutes).

Yeah.  I wasn't thinking carefully about how fast these things are moving.  Good point.

&gt; 1) longitudinally the satellite has to orbit several times before the US rotates under it.
&gt; 2) latitude you can't do anything about. The satellite has to spend equal amounts of time over each hemisphere. Increasing the latitude just means the satellite also spends the same amount of time on the southern latitude.

Are you talking about a longitudinal orbit in point 1?

I was thinking about an orbit in a plane parallel to the equator with satellites packed more densely into latitudes roughly in the middle of the northern hemisphere.

Maybe I don't understand orbital mechanics enough.  I am not an engineer.  Does an orbit need to be on a center-line of the sphere to remain stable?

Anyway.  After revisiting your post doing the math, I'm left a little bit confused.  Hughes says it currently has 1M+ customers, and that they can deliver 25Mbps (admittedly with a pretty low cap, by broadband standards).  I've been having a hard time finding information about how many satellites they're using to achieve that, but even leaving the discussion of orbits aside, I'd be shocked if it were 360 (which is 3% of 12,000).

If we assume the US will have 360 of SpaceX's satellites overhead at any given time, how can you assume that they will only be able to serve 800,000 customers at 10Mbps?  There must be a multiplier based on the fact that not everyone is sucking down their divisional allotment at all times.  I'm not guessing that it gets us to a Muskesque pie-in-the-sky world, but it's got to be better than what Hughes is currently offering.",1534283167
cordcutters,"thats kinda my whole point, the picture quality sacrifices to save money aren't worth it and are a large part of the reason people have this mentality that 4k is a gimmick.

MANY years ago (like 13 years now) I used to install satellite dishes for a summer (till I lost everything to a flood and needed a more local job), I remember one time at this one house I fixed this families lack of signal issue (rotted out splice connection that wasn't properly waterproofed outside) and once everything was back up on going the father made a comment about how he thought the picture quality wasn't worth the money (they had this huge 65"" rear projection), I took a quick look and they had the receiver connected via COAX to the TV, I switched him over to RCA's (which where still in the box they had from when it was all hooked up) and the picture quality was greatly improved. Also explained how it would get even better with an S-video cable if how went and got one of those (this was PRE-HD receiver, so no HDMI)

the point of this story is some things shouldn't be cheaped out on, save your money, check reviews, you'll have a much better experience overall, not saying you gotta drop 3 grand on an OLED or 2500 on a QLED, but at the entry level price point you'll get a better picture from a nicer 1080p TV then going for that 4k because of the corners cut on the 4k model, heck even a 100-200 higher budget will get you into a much better image quality price point 4k unit (even if you may have to buy a separate streaming box, which is honestly the better way to do it because you can upgrade the box with more powerful boxes down the line as the built in to the TV once will just be slow and undersupported, remember a decent TV will last 3-5 times longer then your streaming box and the processor in the TV is usually slower then a Roku Stick at running the Roku OS as it sits today, and buy last I mean won't be so severely out dated that it's to slow to be usable (like trying to use even an Iphone 5s today).",1535671000

What you likely need is a Clear QAM capable tuner. Tuners (converter boxes) come in many flavors, you can get a dedicated Clear QAM box or a ATSC/Clear QAM combo box.

To check for this before you buy another ""box"" you can check your Dynex TV's settings, you will likely see that it is set to pickup ""cable"" (Clear QAM) instead of ""antenna"" (ATSC), or your TV scans both for Clear QAM and ATSC at the same time during setup, and shows you everything it found.  If so, you can also set it to ""antenna"" or ATSC to see if the channels match what your at263 shows

To recap, you likely have an ATSC only box, and it is unable to pickup all the cable channels that your Dynex TV can, because the signal coming from the wall is likely to be Clear QAM.  So to get all the channels you will need a Tuner that supports Clear QAM.

I hope you found this info to be helpful.

Best of luck in resolving your TV/Cable issue...

cordcutters,"The initial rollout of telephone wires was completely without competition so every home and business they passed was a captive customer - 100% uptake guaranteed.  Now maybe they get 50% unless there is no competition.  Guaranteed if there is competition from cable, cable upgrades their outside plant to compete so again they're at maybe 50%.

Telco's, by law until very recently, hasn't been able to retire copper networks when fiber is installed and now they have to show the copper network is unmaintainable. That's why Verizon didn't retire their copper networks where they installed FIOS in the past.  It's not because they wouldn't have saved money because their own studies show it costs them 60% less to maintain a fiber only network.  So their cost is more than double Google's cost to maintain a network because they have to maintain two networks.  No one would benefit more than telco's if they could just completely replace copper with fiber.   

The same tech media crying that telco's don't install fiber have written a series of articles crying/claiming that telco's are purposely not maintaining their copper networks so they can upgrade them to fiber and that people don't have access to 24 hour a day 7 day a week battery backup with fiber.  ARS Technica has written a few of these as has DSL Reports - it's like they're staffed with multiple personality bloggers or more likely pushing union backed stories because union labor would take a beating in an all fiber environment.

Your statement about how simple it would be to replace a 100 year old outside plant and the switching gear associated with it is just that - simple.  You even got the order backwards by implying they could pull out their copper network first then install the fiber.",1533935769

Likely, some of your shows will be on Hulu one day behind.  Perfect.  Others may end up on Netflix and Prime a season late.  You'll miss it for a while, but eventually you won't realize you're behind and still be excited when a new season pops up.  The shows that aren't on  either of those, we were able to get on DirecTV Now, but with no DVR function, we had to go through the individual channel's app.  I have it all figured out now but my husband still complains that he struggles to remember what's where and doesn't notice when new episodes are available.

If you can stay on top of it, you can start and stop subscriptions and only pay for the months that you want the particular content.  We canceled DirectvNow when college basketball and The Walking Dead were over.  I'll turn it back on for basketball season.  Get a month of Netflix and binge the ones you've been waiting for and turn it back off.

cordcutters,"In a nutshell. 

But keep in mind that this is a paradigm shift in terms of OTT providers. If you look at services like YTTV, which is one of the highest rated ones out there, the biggest gripes people have are DVR related. Both with limitations as well as forced VOD. Every other provider uses cloud DVRs, if anything, to give people time shifting access. None are as good as TiVo or other on premise solutions. Nor do they give you the same level of control. HDHRs service puts all of that in your hands with no real restrictions. 

Again, certainly not perfect and as we recently found out has some issues. But it’s also only a few hours old. But I think that it’s heading in the right direction and is a remarkable offering due to how it is setup. ",1534732839
cordcutters,"Sure. In no way am I saying Hulu isn't worth it, or I wouldn't subscribe. When you look at why a majority of people have Netflix vs. Hulu, though, you have to expand beyond cord cutters. For your average person with cable (a significant amount of the country), Hulu provides almost nothing that they can't get on cable.  They have a limited number of originals and their niche content (anime, foreign shows/dramas, etc) is available on other services.

Now for someone like myself who doesn't have cable, Hulu is a good deal. For Hulu to become as prevalent as Netflix, they need to figure out a way to offer what the average cable subscriber doesn't already have. Whether that's originals, new movies, more niche content, or some combination I'm not sure.",1535758472
cordcutters,"I used Hulu when they first started up (2007 I think?). At first they were selling themselves as 'not like cable - no commercials!' And it was great. Obviously, that couldn't last so they added a commercial at the beginning of a video. Fine, OK. Then they went to multiple ad breaks of one ad during a video, and they said that would be it. *sigh* OK, it's still better than cable. Then they added the paid subscription which was supposed to be ad-free (after previously saying that the service would always be free). At the same time the ad breaks went from one to minimum of three ads during a break. The ads went from 5-10 seconds long to 30+. Then the paid subscription had ads too, just fewer of them (for a time there was no ad-free option).

All of this progressed over a period of about two years, with constant promises that the advertising levels would not be increased which would then be broken in a month or two. The constant devolvement of the quality of the service got tiresome and started to look malicious. Basically, they created a user base and then started exploiting them as greedily as they felt they could get away with. Personally, that kind of behavior pushed me away from the service. Netflix never treated their customer base in such a way.",1535755448

An interesting aspect of this though is that, [according to their FAQ](https://www.silicondust.com/support/faq/#when-will-plex-emby-kodi-the-channels-app-on-ios-and-other-third-parties-be-able-to-access-premium-tv-channels), it seems the channels are being piped through the HDHomeRun, and they even state that with a few tweaks, third-party apps and add-ons can stream these channels just like any other HDHomeRun channel. If this means that these could actually be watched through things like Plex and Emby, that would make this a *very* compelling option for many people.

Only major hiccup I see with this service is that it doesn't seem to have any regional sports networks, just ESPN and its various spin-offs. That would be a deal breaker for many.

Other shows you probably don't care much about and they can be replaced with others on broadcast or streaming.

cordcutters,Ehhh.  But “channel count” doesn’t really mean much if you barely watch them.  The whole point of cord cutting was to not have the extra “bloat” cable throws on you.  For me my priority is sports.  And on DTVN to actually get the channels to watch your local teams you have to go to their 55 or 65 package with just 2 streams for what you can get with Vue for 50 and 5 streams or 40 with YTTV and 3 streams.  Both have a better DVR and actually have the ability to rewind live TV.  If you work and have a family it’s hard enough to watch the 50+ channels that YTTV has or the 60+ Vue Core has.  Having an inferior service just to say “Hey I have more channels I don’t actually watch... but you know I have them just in case” doesn’t mean much.,1535422052

All that to say: yep, I'm pretty sure the picture quality won't be any better if you subscribe. Some folks have raised the issue of the low bitrates/PQ to HDHomeRun on Twitter and they responded that they hope to improve that in the future. As for times, I think they may be streaming the Pacific feeds for some channels and the Eastern feeds for others. Something they need to get straightened out.

It would work well for me if I were on YTTV as well since it has the aforementioned Hallmark Channels as well as History, Travel and Discovery.  

I have tried Philo and it was a good service. But it lacked a guide and more importantly it lacked the Hallmark Channels that are important to my wife (especially in a couple months).

Try removing all other devices that are plugged into phone jacks in the home (I'm assuming that either you have a filter on each device, or you have a splitter outside your home in the demarc, with a dedicated line to the DSL jack) to make sure none of them are bad.  This is the where you start.  Assuming that the connection to the DSL jack is good, after checking your (hopefully better) DSL speeds, you can plug each device back into the jacks in the house and see if one of them is bad.

i would probably start with running some new coax RG6 or at the very least check the crimp connectors.. you should probably be using the newer water proof connectors on the coax not the crush crimp ones.. 

one easy thing you can do if you have a volt meter is to find out what your amplifier's injector power supply is really putting out.. then go up to the power in cable on the amplifier and see if you are getting the same voltage.. that might suggest a bad connector not passing enough power to your amp.. 

Its a possibility that you would probably overlook as it happened to me and I didn't catch it for a day .. made a new cable and things were much better.

also another thing that happened to me is I have an RCA amp along with my Channel Master 7777 ... well it seems that UHF burnt out on that amp and it only passes VHF .. maybe something like that happened .. its a possibility

cordcutters,"That's the wrong question. It just replaces one monopoly with another. The right question is, ""how do I end this monopoly and get competition in the market?"" 

My town was the first town in the country to have cable competition. We had only Comcast (the company they bought actually, I can't remember its name any more), and when the monopoly contract expired they went to the town, fully expecting a renewal, buy our town board had had too many complaints and said ""no, no renewal. You don't have to leave, but we're allowing competition now."" Concast threatened to leave, and the town basically told them ""don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.""

RCN began installing *immediately*.

Twenty-ish years later, for Internet we have a choice of Comcast, RCN, Verizon FIOS, Verizon ISDN, and 4 or 5 wireless providers. Monthly rates for Internet or TV service are 30% to 50% less than neighboring towns because *we* have *competition*, and everybody knows that if they don't offer a superior rate we'll take our business elsewhere. 

A few years ago I wanted to install cable internet in my home where I'd lived for 4 or 5 years. Comcast couldn't handle it, they had a glitch in their computer and insisted my address didn't exist, and in 3 days they couldn't work out a resolution. I called RCN and had service installed in less than 24 hours. 

I sat down to talk to the state lawyers that handle such monopoly contracts for towns a couple years after it happened, and asked them what citizens should do to encourage such competition. They said it's really simple - contact your town elected representatives (like alderman, city councilmen, mayor, etc) and tell them that as a voter you want them to just not renew the monopoly contract when it expires. Tell them you don't want them to replace one monopoly with another, just to allow competition in the market. Find out when the expiration is, and contact competitors to get them to come testify with you that the monopoly should end and that they want to bring in competition. ",1535233065

I follow football so I usually add more sports during college football season. I can rotate that off to add HBO when HBO has GoT on or Starz if they have something on. The same goes for a service.

yes the wooden pole in my yard used to be for electricity and telephone, but the electricity has recently been routed underground, so they chopped off the wooden pole down to where the telephone is...  still about 16ft up.  there is currently a phone line going overhead from the pole to my house, i could run the cable along that.. just low voltage telephone.  but if something happened by accident and it knocked out phone line, i'd be in trouble.",1534206961
cordcutters,"I live in Birmingham AL and have Directv Now.  The local NBC affiliate carried the NO Saints vs Jacksonville preseason game tonight (Saints network).  However when I tried to watch it, Directv Now had a screen saying ""Something went wrong.  This program cannot be streamed on this platform.""  I'm using a Roku.  What a bummer!!  Very aggravating.  Streaming services that operate like cable need to be treated like the other programming delivery methods. Why should the delivery technology make any difference?",1533869192
cordcutters,"I still keep a fleet of ReplayTvs running (requires an archaeologist now since they are so old). Compared to our super up to date 8ch direct OTA to SSD recorder - the Replay still often wins?

My playful response? I guess after avoiding a diet of dogshit all your life - it's difficult to start :)

cordcutters,"They're killing off fiber slowly though. It's tragic. 

They've slowed down all of their expansion and are putting R&amp;D into wireless solutions. Realistically they won't go nationwide with fiber optic. 

I miss having Google Fiber so much. It was flawless service, 100% uptime, no lag. 

So much better than Cable Companies. Comcast has had random outages 3x in the past year and a half for me, turns off my modem at midnight randomly and slows down erratically: All while costing more per month than Fiber.",1533168507
cordcutters,"Well, whatever the case it sounds like you will be better off staying with cable. 

Now if your situation was similar to me and my GF it would be different. I have no kids so this option works fine.

$65/mo for 100mbps internet through spectrum.

$0/mo OTA which picks up all my locals. 

$25/mo month for sling tv which includes espn. Really just for college football season. Only subscribe for about 6 months a year.

About $10/mo for Amazon prime. I pay yearly for reduced price.

$15/mo for HBO go but only subscribe to that about 6 months a year.

$10 or so a month for Netflix a couple months out of the year.

Anything else we really want to watch be it tv shows or movies we rent through Amazon prime video.

So even if I subscribed to all those services year round I'm looking at $125/mo vs $210+ a month for cable as I would still be paying for Amazon prime and/or netflix

But for six months out of the year I'm really only paying about $75/mo.

As someone else mentioned cord cutting is not for everyone.

cordcutters,"Depending on your needs, keeping cable/satellite+internet for a few bucks above the cost of internet+streaming can make sense. I don't think streaming is the best choice for everyone, or something everyone would appreciate/prefer. At the same time, it's not as if cable/satellite is foolproof. Since going all-in with streaming, I haven't had anything blacked out, haven't been impacted by an outage, have had all my local channels and have unlimited DVR. Obviously, some of that depends on where you live, but my experience with YouTube TV as a heavy live sports watcher has been excellent.

It seems like pretty much everyone who shares a post like this original poster's really wants to get away from the cable/satellite model: lease hardware from the cable/satellite company, hope it doesn't crap out after a year, pay a monthly fee for the right to use DVR, see mysterious fees all over your bill, deal with equipment and/or cancellation fees, receive terrible customer service like clockwork. Streaming a great alternative and you really don't give up much, if anything.

Streaming, at the very least, simply allows you to take more control over your TV viewing. You buy a streaming device or two, you pay for the subscriptions you want, you cancel/subscribe at the drop of a hat and without penalty. My Rokus all cost \~$50 and work great for years, receive automatic updates and support, and allow you to access all kinds of media. Meanwhile, I've never had a cable/satellite box that didn't turn into a slow POS after a year.",1535391107

cordcutters,"I'd be very curious when they measured that 2.5 Million.  Back in May, CBS All Access did a promo for a free month of service.  I took advantage of that to consume Star Trek Discovery, then canceled immediately after but CBS keeps the sub alive for the rest of the promo period.  I'm sure I'm not the only one.  I was surprised at how little exclusive content was on the service that I cared about.  Maybe 3 shows, and I didn't even bother watching the other two.

So how many of those 2.5Million are free subs?",1533517761
cordcutters,"Big fan of the Surfboard (mostly because it’s inexpensive) as well as having a separate modem and router.   Apparently the guts of the Xfinity modem/router is the same ARRIS hardware, and they have not really upgraded that part of the system in years.   I feel like you can have the modem that will work for years, and you can swap out a router if you move and need more coverage or if the tech gets obsolete for cheaper than buying a modem/router combo.  

I wanted to go nuts with a mesh system, but my house is not big enough to need it.  Got a mid level Netgear router and have no problem streaming to the two TVs at the complete opposite end of the house.  SO HAPPY I bought my own (and trying not to think about the 8 years I spent “renting.”)
