How to watch the MLB Postseason 2018,"One edit. TBS will have the AL playoffs after the WED Wildcard game on ESPN.  TBS seems to be a basic channel on all services.  FS1 is exclusive for the NL. MLB Network will mix in some games for both the AL and NL divisional series, mostly day games.Another option is the MLB audio At Bat. It gets audio through your browser and their app. It's a good way if your team is playing a lot of day games while at work.  I think they have an Oct package that is only about $5.00."
How to watch the MLB Postseason 2018,I'm stuck in a hotel IN Atlanta with no MLBN on their cable. So weird I can't even watch the Braves in their hometown.

Netflix is planning a sci-fi universe based on the novel 'Recursion',One that isn't even out yet.  Nice and cheap.  Wayward pines was so dumb though so I'm a little hopeful they don't bring in the original author.
Netflix is planning a sci-fi universe based on the novel 'Recursion',Blake Crouch is a brilliant author. It’s NOT his fault the wayward pines tv series sucked. It loosely (at best) followed the story line of the 3 books.
Netflix is planning a sci-fi universe based on the novel 'Recursion',"I wonder if this is really the best way to do this - base it on the universe, but not the book. That way there's no ""the book was better"" or ""they're changing the book"". I'd like to see that space explored more."

Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),What's the Hulu $5.99 deal?
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),You should either have an email or just sign up on the website before the offer expires (I think it's this month?). It's basic Hulu for $5.99 instead of $7.99. I've been on the same plan for years and my rate has always been discounted. 
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Where do you get the deal?
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Cancel and within a month or so you'll get the offer.  I'm in the same boat as OP.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"If you view [the Hulu homepage](https://www.hulu.com/welcome) without logging in, you should see the $5.99 for 1 year offer near the center of the page. "
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Does anyone know if Hulu tv includes the tv show  and commercial free show premium Hulu has? I would like to have live tv with Hulu, since YouTube tv had shows on demand you can’t fast forward. "
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Yes, if you get ""Enhanced Cloud DVR"" you can fast forward your recorded show commercials...except on a couple very strict channels (I've only run into it once or twice - I believe on a sporting event, but most NFL and ESPN games I've been able to fast forward) If you're viewing it direct from their on-demand library, which usually has the most recent few shows and in some cases the whole series, then it doesn't show a commercial at all.Here's how my account is setup:Hulu (No Commercials) with Live TV 43.99/moEnhanced Cloud DVR 14.99/moUnlimited Screens 14.99/mo\-10.00 for bundling the two add-ons aboveHBO 14.99/moShowtime 8.99/moGrand total of 87.95/moThe on-demand library is pretty extensive, and even though the Viacom channels are missing, and BBC America is missing, I'm pretty happy with the channel selection and for getting ALL the local channels and the regional sports channels.You get used to the UI...and my only complaint initially was buffering on live feeds but they've seem to have fixed that and it runs great on 100meg fiber with Roku."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"It includes the basic Hulu, and I think you can pay $4 extra a month for commercial free Hulu.  If you want to fast forward through commercials on DVR, though, that costs $15 a month."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Are you A Ted Danson or THE Ted Danson?
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),THE Ted Danson. AMA!
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),I switched to commercial free last night. I think it's $12/mo which is $6/mo more for no ads.  But I did some math...  An hour long show on Hulu has about 18min of ads. If you only watch 3 hours of Hulu each month that's almost an hour worth of ads. Would you watch an hour of ads for $6?  That's less than minimum wage.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Only if you actually sit there and watch the ads. They give you a timer so you know exactly how long you have to pee, grab food, talk, check your phone, etc. I understand why people hate ads and prefer the ad free sub but they don't bother me enough to pay the extra $6. I think I'm in the minority though."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Did you have to cancel your subscription to get it? Mine makes me manage through iTunes and didn't have an option for 5. 99.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),It may not be available through iTunes. Sign up via the website instead.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Is this just a glitch in your favor?It clearly states that it's only for one year then reverts to $7.99 again.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),No. I have this deal too. I received an email about a month ago telling it had been renewed. Its possible that it is targeted to long time Hulu users. I have subscribed repeatedly since the first plan was introduced. I think they are trying to limit churn.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),Mine has already been credited for over a year and is currently showing it will expire Oct 2019.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"If you cancel then re-subscribe, do you lose all of your show subscriptions, or do they retain those in case you come back?"
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"They stick around as long as you're using the same credentials to sign back up as you did the first time. I stopped using Hulu for over a year and came back, and when I did, it still remembered what I was watching from before I left."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Man I really wish Hulu would offer any deals or bundles that include the No-Commercials option. I currently subscribe to Hulu through the Hulu/Spotify Premium deal (non-student one), and on one hand it's nice to be able to listen to stuff on Spotify without ever hearing the ultra-annoying ads that you get with Spotify free, but on the other hand it's soooo obnoxious to have to watch ads on Hulu. I don't mind paying more, just give me the option. Hulu especially irritates me with their ads because I routinely watch it between multiple (about 5) devices (TVs with Hulu Apps, Monitors w/ Chromecasts attached, XB1) plus my Android tablet, depending on where I am in the house, and what I'm doing. Every time I stop something I'm watching on Hulu to switch the screen or device I'm using it on, when I resume playback of whatever I was watching, it's been ""rewinded"" back past the most recent ad break so that I'm forced to watch ads again before getting back to where I actually left off. Sometimes I can catch this fast enough to fast forward past the ad break, but usually they still wind up playing. It's infuriating.      "
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Same here for the past 2 years, hopefully I will still have it next month when my $5.99 deal runs out."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"Just tried contacting them see if they’d give me the deal, they told me I had to cancel and sign up with a new email. And then was like you’d only save 2 bucks..."
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),You should not need to sign up with a new email. 2 bucks is 2 bucks.
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),It's two buck a month. That's 24 bucks!
Hulu $5.99 deal (for existing subscribers on the same deal),"It's $24 a year, and is the difference for me between me dropping Hulu or keeping it. I like it much better at $5.99 than $7.99. For $7.99 I'll drop it and pick it up occasionally. For $5.99 it's 'what the heck, I'll just keep it'. Hulu knows this :)"

Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,"Been using Pluto TV on my android box for a year or so and I really enjoy the service. Programing quality has become much better in the last few months. There are shows, music, movies but nothing that is super recent (except for the music). Honestly my favorite part is that all the channels are uncensored. "

Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,"It's been on my TV for a while. It's hit and miss -- mostly low quality content, I would say? But there are some things worth watching for sure. It's basically a free IPTV service, with all that entails."
Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,"its good to see it expanding. i have been accessing the us version. interestingly if you access the pluto tv website here in australia without trying to circumvent geo blocking, we get a version of live channels made up with strictly youtube videos. it has been these way for like 2 years so im not sure if that means they plan to expand here at some point or not."
Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,Really don't care for this service. It has been slow and clunky on my Roku and desktop. It took them three or four years to support closed captioning even they were required to by law (about the only FCC regulations for streaming services are for closed captioning) even though they got at least three rounds of venture capital funding during that time. Some devices seem to have closed captioning on some channels now but it's inconsistent.
Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,"It's been my go to free service lately for background streaming. The Roku performance has picked up from early in the year, at least on my TCL and Roku 3. My understanding (and I may be wrong) is that they are curating the streams of many channels from the content owners, and this is why there is a inconsistency on the CC. "

Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,What gets me is that they play the same commercial exactly 4 times in a row during a single commercial break
Free TV service Pluto TV lands on Roku streaming players in the UK,Most shows Ive seen take the same commercial breaks (albeit a little skewed timing wise) as the original program did. They have to to maintain the 30 min time slot. Are some not like that?

Wife wants to watch cooking channel,"Philo - $20 /month for tier that includes Cooking Channel, and you can DVR it"
Wife wants to watch cooking channel,PlayStation Vue Core tier has Cooking Channel and you can DVR good eats.  (And you do not need a play station)
Wife wants to watch cooking channel,"Most cable shows are available for digital purchase on iTunes/Amazon/Google Play with episodes released the day after they are broadcast. I’m not familiar with the show. There’s are 15 seasons listed on iTunes but the newest episode appears to be from about 2011. Assuming this is some sort of revival. Check one of these outlets shortly before the premier and see if they are selling a season pass. It will probably cost under $30 for all episodes and you’ll own them to stream whenever you wish. Second best option would be Philo subscription for $20 per month. Wait until a few weeks into the season for the first few episodes to be archived on-demand, and she can probably binge the entire season for 1 or 2 months’ fees. "
Wife wants to watch cooking channel,You can check and see if the season is for sale On iTunes and Amazon. 
Looking to finally cut cord in Pittsburgh. Need advice.,That really comes down to what's avalible in your area you need to figure out who services your area so unless you want to post your exact address here at least come back with a list of service providers avalible to you.
Looking to finally cut cord in Pittsburgh. Need advice.,We are with Xfinity at the moment. Verizon also services our area. 
Looking to finally cut cord in Pittsburgh. Need advice.,"I'm from the area and I went with Hulu. We get just about everything that we got with cable. I also like Directv Now since it pretty much replaces cable with all the channels, but it can be buggy. They need to work some things out which I'm sure they will.I guess I should ask, what are you looking to watch? "
Looking to finally cut cord in Pittsburgh. Need advice.,Fios has been having a $39.99 internet only package that would be worth looking into. 
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"They’re all pretty synonymous when it comes to purchasing tv seasons. Amazon has the added benefit of their prime video platform, if you’re a prime member."
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"I am.  From what I understand I could still access that through the AppleTV though, correct?  Though I thought I heard something about the Amazon AppleTV app not supporting surround sound, though that could’ve been old news and maybe it’s fixed.  "
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"I think Amazon might be a little cheaper for some shows, if you care about pricing at that level. I recommend doing the DirectTV Now promo where you prepay a few months of the service and get a ""free"" Apple TV 4k. You can stream from Apple and Amazon's libraries with it. Extra perk (in my opinion) is you can download your purchased apple content onto your laptop for offline viewing. Amazon only allows offline viewing for tablets and phones."
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"Darn, looks like that expired, that did look like it was a solid deal.  Being able to download to a laptop is a plus.  "
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"I prefer amazon but don’t have a really good reason why them over any other and if you’re going to try crunchyroll try vrv its crunchy+funimation+drama fever+mubi,shutter,mondo,nicksplat for 10 bucks crazy good deal "
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,Two things:1) I’ll echo what everyone else has said and say amazon would be my recommendation.Amazon has a tv app on pretty much all major platforms from iOS to Xbox.  So it gives you flexibility to watch your shows even if you decide to change platforms. 2) have you considered a cord cutter tv service instead of buying the shows individually?  I only ask because I use youtubetv and watch pretty much all of the same shows you do.  It’s still a fraction of the price of dish ($40 a month) and has the added bonus of not having to wait 24 hours for the episodes to come up.
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"Going with the AppleTV and buying through Amazon seems like it may be the way to go. On YouTube TV, I haven’t paid much attention to it, are the shows in HD and with at least 5.1 Dolby Digital on it?"
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"Honestly,  while I use an Apple TV as my main device I buy TV shows from Amazon, Vudu, and iTunes to get the best deals. All of those sources are viewable on my Apple TV. Granted on my Roku or Shield I can’t access the iTunes purchases but that isn’t that big of a deal to me. I really like being able to shop for the best deal on seasons or catching  seasons on sale on the different services yet still being able to access them.  Since you own an Apple TV I would say don’t just stick with the one store and instead shop around for the best prices. "
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"Not all apps are available on every front end. It's all about content control. Amazon isn't chromecastable. It's available on android os, like the nvidia shield.If you're locked into Apple already then your options are limited.   Apple locks down their ecosystem pretty hard. If you start buying on itunes then you have to use things that work with itunes. I think the nvidia shield is the best front end. Roku also has decent app support, due to it not competing on content."
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"Personally, as far as purchasing content goes, I tend to prefer device-agnostic services like Vudu.  I don't like the idea of losing access to my purchases if two companies get into a pissing match (like Google and Amazon currently are).  Out of the choices you mentioned, though, Amazon is the one with the most devices under its belt."
Which ecosystem is best for buying TV Seasons?,"If you’re an Apple guy and don’t expect that to change, iTunes purchases will give you the best integration. Apple TV supports every major streaming app at this point. And it’s “TV” app does an effective job of organizing your purchased content across all apple devices, alerting you when new episodes are released, etc. But TV shows purchased thru iTunes only play on Apple devices and PCs. No android. No amazon fire. No Roku. If you want to hedge against the possibility of changing platforms, buying thru someone like Amazon or Vudu is probably wise. Depending on how much you watch, you could also consider a live streaming service like YouTube TV or PS Vue. YTTV costs $40 per month, far less than your satellite bill. It has dozens of channels and a digital DVR. "
Hulu Live vs DirecTV Now? ...,"3rd baby coming after the older 2 have gone to college?? Nice. I guess you really hated being empty nesters :). Have you considered YouTube TV at all? I find it to be the best streaming service. Between Hulu Live and DirecTV Now, you’d probably be better off with DirectTV Now being an AT&T customer. You’d get some DVR functionality without having to pay more for it and $5 HBO add-on if you watch HBO at all. "
Hulu Live vs DirecTV Now? ...,"He meant the third would be in college. lol  Direct tv now has a great mix of channels, a 20 hr dvr ( soon to be more) and a good interface.  I did not care for hulu's interface for live, but give them or all the streaming services a try and pick what suits you.  That is what is great about cord cutting. No contracts. "
TV stations still on VHF-LO band,"METV in NYC, the #1 market, has been RF 3 for years. I pick it up perfectly with a vhf lo antenna. Not sure what your post is supposed to be but vhf lo is not hard to get if you have the right antenna (big vhf lo antenna) and are in a good location. I see people here talking about how hard rf 6 is to get in philly (mind you, I don’t know the technical parameters of that station or how powerful it transmits) but then they say they have a Mohu Leaf. What do you expect?  That piece of garbage antenna can’t bend the laws of physics. "
TV stations still on VHF-LO band,"The history of your station is fascinating: "" The station, originally located in Ely, Nevada, signed on July 9, 2001 as KVNV, a satellite of KVBC, the NBC affiliate in Las Vegas....... The owner sought permission to reallocate KVNV from Ely to  New Jersey, as part of a legal loophole that allows any VHF station that moves to a state with no FCC-licensed commercial VHF stations to receive automatic permission to move. - ""(The loophole was set up because many New Jersey TV viewers felt shortchanged that nearly all their commercial TV stations came from either New York City or Philadelphia, not from their own state.)"""
TV stations still on VHF-LO band,"WRGB Schenenctady is transmitting on their historical assignment of channel 6.  When the DTV transition started, they were comfortably and reliably on channel 39.  After the analog shutdown, they moved back to 6 much to everyone's dismay.  Why they didn't stay on 39, I have no clue."
TV stations still on VHF-LO band,"Most DTV stations returned to their original channel when the 2009 shutdown happened (example: My channels 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 left UHF and returned to their old historical channels).   - As for your station, probably because 39 was allocated to someone else.  And even if they had kept 39, they would have been bumped by the FCC Auction which sold all channels above 37."
Best streaming device?,"I have tried and used them all and ended up with all Roku devices in my home because they have the most apps, are easiest to use, and basically never buffer. AndroidTV boxes like Mibox have limited app support, crash frequently, and the chromecast option has many issues. Chromecast devices require you to use your phone instead of a remote which is fine for one person but inconvenient for family. FireTV is missing some google apps like youtube and play movies and firesticks buffer way more than Roku sticks or Chromecast.  AppleTV is great if you are deep in the Apple ecosystem and need to mirror Mac and iphone screens otherwise its too expensive and the remote is terrible. "
Best streaming device?,The best is the Nvidia Shield but the most reliable is Roku.
Best streaming device?,really a personal choice each has strengths and weaknesses. as a pure video streaming service device i went with rokus but i also have a 3rd gen apple tv so i am covered for any itunes purchases or rentals. the shield tv has a lot of positives but a few drawbacks as does the newer 4th gen and 4k apple tv. there’s not one size fits all.
Best streaming device?,"I think you are overlapping two different things.  I use in combination both a Sony Android TV and a Roku box as well.I like the Sony TV for loading up my own unique Android apps, and the use of the Google Assistant.  You also forgot to mention the Bluetooth and the built-in Chromecast on Sony TVs which I find super handy as well!But for just regular video streaming apps like Netflix, Prime, Pluto, etc,, the Roku is the simplest and most convenient device to use. The Smart TVs (all brands) just are a little too clumsy to use for this purpose.  Plus the Roku has by far the most channel choices which is very beneficial also."
Best streaming device?,"ROKU FOR LIFE.  No seriously, my Roku 3 from 5 year ago still is the most used device in my house.  Going to jump to the ultra 4k unit soon.  Supports all the major stream services I use (youtube, casting, hbo, hulu, netflix, prime video and more).  Simple interface, good load times, ease of use for everyone. "
Best streaming device?,"I love my Shield, but not having certain apps on the Android store has been a hassle. "
Best streaming device?,"Although I mostly use Roku, I see consistently better performance from my Amazon Fire 4k TV Box. DirecTV Now is great with the Amazon Fire but so slow as to be unusable through Roku.Still, I mostly use Roku because Philo is better through Roku and both TVs in-house are Roku TVs."
Best streaming device?,"I like Roku. It works very well and there are no conflicts with streaming apps like Fire TV and YTTV, etc. I like the remote. I got a Fire TV Pendant that works well, but I am not real crazy about the remote for some reason, so it will be getting sent back. There is nothing really out there that competes with the Roku unless you want to spend more money. "
Best streaming device?,"Lots say Apple TV 4k is the best. I have one and it is good, but I like the built in Roku aspect of my TCL tv better. "
Best streaming device?,Any particular reason or reasons why? Trying to compare things.
Best streaming device?,"I love the Apple TV, but despise the trackpad remote. I wish Apple would come out with a new remote similar to the new Fire TV remote just announced by Amazon. "

What antenna should we get?,How much do you care about the ION network? I ask because it is off to the east with the rest of the signals coming from north to  northwest. If you would be willing to risk not getting ION you could probably make a single antenna work. Examples:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018Two combined antenna suggestion on request...
What antenna should we get?,My personal favorite is the  [Xtreme Signal HDB8X-NI 8-Bay VHF/UHF HDTV Bowtie Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CXQO00K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)I tried several indoor antennas and a couple of outdoor antenna's. I found the most success and channels with this one. For me I needed a bi-directional antenna.

I believe the clause was originally meant for rural areas where the TV signal doesn't cover the edges of the market very well, so they allow organizations setup re-transmitters to extend the range of the broadcasts, and as long as they're only transmitting within the designated market area, and not making money off the broadcasts, and they don't need the channels' permission.Locast is arguing that clause applies to internet broadcasts as well since it can be difficult to receive OTA broadcasts in cities due to interference and tall buildings and such, so as long as they're only broadcasting within the designated market area (they make you create an account and verify your location), they feel that retransmitting over the internet without the channel's permission is legal (Unlike Aereo which was a for profit business). I'm sure they'll be challenged on this in court sooner or later and we'll see if that defense holds up."

How Cable Has Fueled OTT,"strikes me that Cable fueled OTT by driving the costs of a package up.Cable should cost significantly less then the electric bill, instead it's significantly more."
How Cable Has Fueled OTT,"Agree 100%.  Cable will blame it on rising entertainment costs, but somehow OTT has managed to keep costs down.  Gee, maybe it's because they don't gouge their customers?  In my area cable has now taken to jacking up ISP prices continually, probably because they are bleeding TV subs.  I'm just lucky I have an alternative, most people don't (yet).  But when they do, cable will be headed out the door, as they should be, the greedy suckers!"
How Cable Has Fueled OTT,"> As the demand for bandwidth kept increasing, service providers obliged........  When bandwidth is 1 Gbit/s, there is no congestion and thus no need to prioritize. Without congestion, an OTT edge service provider can get its traffic through as well as virtually any in-house prioritized service.> Not only are OTT voice players able to compete, but OTT video players can thrive.

Looking for an advice.,"Streaming services need to independently contract with local affiliates to carry the major broadcast networks. That includes your local stations for ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and (to a lesser degree) CW. Plug your zip code in the website of several services and see if live ABC (and others) is offered. You may also want to look at Regional Sports Networks as those will carry dozens of games for your local teams. If you’re an NBA fan, give some consideration to NBA TV. YouTube Tv has NBA channel in its plan for $40. PS Vue has it in their $50 plan. Hulu doesn’t carry that network. Directv Now is another option but do yourself a favor and consider it a last resort. It’s been around for nearly 2 years now and is still maddeningly unreliable. "
Looking for an advice.,"Thanks for the detailed advice. Feels like my best bet is either Youtube channel or Hulu. They are $10 cheaper than Vue, and has all local sport channel, tnt, espn and abc.

Advice on Antenna to Also Receive ABC (TVFool Link Inside),"Check this out:* https://rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&callsign=week#stationWEEK is transmitting NBC/ABC/CW, all in HD. Probably not great for  bit rate but if you are happy with that source of ABC, then everything gets a lot easier. Everything in the UHF band and close. So an indoor antenna is definitely worth trying. For the attic a 4 bay UHF antenna would be more than good.

Advice on Antenna to Also Receive ABC (TVFool Link Inside),"Thanks for the information!  I hadn't noticed that ABC was also on that band.  Only at 720p, but that's the best I can seem to get for most of the stations in central IL.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008KVUAGU - I picked up this Mediasonic Homeworx antenna about 3 years ago as a quick test to see what would be possible, but now I'm looking to get more serious about cutting out Comcast and switching fully to a fiber internet solution with an antenna (and probably a Tablo once I figure out the antenna situation.)I guess I could pick up something a bit more expensive and see how the stations come in.  Right now reception isn't that great, but I'm attributing that to the antenna being on the west side of the house and maybe 2ft above floor level due to mounting issues.EDIT:  I was planning on getting the antenna ""just right"" then focusing on picking up a 4-channel Tablo around Black Friday.  I have a closet with an east-facing window that I could plug in the Tablo and the antenna.  It'd all be out of the way and a LOT simpler than trying to route coax from the attic to the basement (where most of my network infrastructure is).  I'm liking the indoor antenna option a lot more now!"

Vidgo Nears Debut of National OTT-TV Service,"This service was teased a few years ago at CES. It looks like they decided to focus or add the Latino market.

I  can't tell if they will have many English language channels  or a separate plan."

"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","> Ideally, I'd like to receive all of the locals down to FOX. Fox is going to require an outdoor antenna.  And you have an additional issue in that your stations are ~180º apart.   I generally don't recommend this antenna, but a DB8E might work for you.  Point it at the Fox station, and it's back lobes will pick up the other stations. The Solid Signal 8 bay bow tie should work good too.  "

"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","I'm no expert, but I'll share my experience as a relatively new cordcutter. I got a cheap amplified indoor antenna and picked up only a handful of channels.  Then I replaced my old satellite dish with an RCA Yagi outdoor/attic antenna and pick up over 120 channels.  Most of my towers are in the same general direction from my house, though.Personally, I wouldn't bother with another flat/indoor antenna in your situation.  Maybe consider a bowtie or other multidirectional antenna?  Could always get one from Walmart and return it if it doesn't work well.  "
"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?",If you want to go with an attic antenna and have a BJ's near you they have a Clearstream 4 for $79 right now.  This goes for $100 to $149.00  everywhere else.  It does UHF and VHF.  I have not tried this model so I can't comment on the performance.
"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?",>The 1byone box says it gets 28dB gain  ...That type of antenna would have negative gain. They are trying to confuse you by quoting the amplifier gain. Two entirely different things.Make sure the antenna is kept away from things that can cause interference like electronics and LED/CFL lights. Try turning stuff off to check.
"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","I started with a Mohu Leaf, very unsatisfactory. Got a ClearStream 2, much much better. Bearing in mind that the ClearStream used indoors needs some space in front of a window, it sits on a table."
"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","> The 1byone box says it gets 28dB gain28 Gain is for the amplifier, and it's probably just amplifying Noise because the antenna is too small to capture the signal.   Unfortunately your stations are in multiple directions.  I think I'd try a CM4228 in your living room (no amplifier), aimed towards 254 degrees (west) and get the other stations off the backside of the CM4228. - If that works, then move it to the attic.Another option is this Flatwave Air (the black colored one): http://www.winegard.com/flatwave  Or this hyperstrong antenna: http://dennysantennaservice.com/hd_stacker_tv_antenna-html.html"

"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","CM4228, an old design, placed in an attic is not going to work for this guy.  Stay away from the Flatwave Air.  That stacked antenna must be outside, and it will not be good for his situation either.  Its beam is too tight."
"Poor reception with first antenna, what next?","You'll probably want an omnidirectional antenna of some kind, because your best channels are coming in from multiple directions.Fox will be troublesome though because it's 2Edge, which means it has to bend over high terrain to get to you. You might be able to get it with an omnidirectional, but it'll be finicky. Tilting the antenna up in the direction of the Fox channel could help, but it might degrade the reception of the channels coming in the opposite direction."

Does this antenna get VHF signals?,"You can get acceptable high VHF reception with a 22"" or thereabouts long dipole antenna. I was getting pretty good reception with a VHF add on kit to a clear stream antenna at 63 miles from the towers.

Yeah, it probably isn't very good for the VHF-low band but if the transmitters are close enough it might work.No one should buy a ""150 mile"" antenna for performance on any band. You buy it because you think it looks cool, is cheap and you don't care if it breaks in a few months."
Does this antenna get VHF signals?,"> VHF waves are 18 feet long, and the antenna needs to be large tooNot for VHF-Hi used for TV.   14-20 inch dipoles are what we are talking about  With that said, this is a garbage antenna.  It should be avoided."
Does this antenna get VHF signals?,">>> VHF waves are 18 feet long>> Not for VHF-Hi used for TV.You seem to imply that VHF-LO is no longer used for TV (not true).   ""18 feet"" is actually the worst case (channel 2), which I probably should have taken the average instead.  If we limit ourselves to VHF-HI, we're still looking at almost 6 feet wavelength (channel 7) so you need a large antenna if the channel is used in your area.  - BTW my city uses VHF-LO (channel 6) with a wavelength over 11 feet.  I had to buy a special extra-large antenna just for that one channel."

"Netflix Developing 'The Chronicles of Narnia' Films, TV Series","I'm definitely excited about a potential longer form TV series, rather than films. I think a TV series would give the opportunity to better explore the other storys in the chronicles (I've always wanted to see The Magician's Nephew on screen). Having being brought up watching the 90's BBC TV series' of some of the chronicles, I think the extra breathing room given to a TV series allows a lot more development of the characters and the world that Narnia would benefit greatly from.

"Do any US streamers watch ""Later..."" (the Jools Holland music show)?","Searching around, I think this airs on MTV Live in the US. You can get that channel via Philo for $20 a month. Includes Cloud DVR, so you can record it if it's not available on-demand."

HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,"Just to clarify, it's a marketing gimmick to call an antenna an 'HDTV antenna.' All TV antennas pull both analog and digital signals from the air. What matters is whether the TV can handle the signal received (e.g., older TVs need a converter box to change the digital signal to analog).  It's why you can buy a house that has a 1970s roof-mounted antenna and use it to watch digital HDTV without modification. (Well, if it's really from the 1970s, you might have to tack a coax jack onto the cable that runs into the house. You used to have to screw down bare wires on the back of a TV.)"
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,Are there any antennas Not called HDTV antennas?  It seems every ad I view uses the phrase.   **OP:** Your signals are strong so try the Winegard Flatwave (the black one) http://www.winegard.com/flatwave
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,Nailed it. 
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,The wirecutter recently ran a [review series ](https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-indoor-hdtv-antenna/)   They’re pretty good usually. 
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,"An omnidirectional antenna rated for 30-40 miles will probably do you best since you have signals coming from two different directions.If that doesn't work well enough though, the more advanced option would be two directional(aka: unidirectional) antennas pointed N/NE and S/SW, plugged into an OTA TV combiner to merge the signals would work too, though you might sacrifice getting channel 39(43.1) that way since it's off on its own in the East."
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,"> An omnidirectional antenna rated for 30-40 miles will probably do you best since you have signals coming from two different directions.A directional antenna would be better, since most of his stations are 180 degrees apart.  Some stations will be received on the forward side... others on the rear side.  (That's how my CM4228 is setup.)"
HDTV Antenna Suggestions!,"As already mentioned, you have signals coming from two directions (Dayton, Cincinnati). If you mostly just want the popular networks you could point an antenna towards your stronger/closer signals (Dayton, a bit east of due north). The Dayton direction is particularly convenient as all the popular networks are in the same TV band (UHF). So for an easy install (no adjustment) you could use a boring old 4 bay UHF type antenna pointed northish.

A Stellar Labs 30-2426 or a Digiwave ANT2086/Solid Signal XS HDB4X ?These both seem to be the lower cost option, Both are very close in price and look very similar in specs and design. Does anyone have any experience in one over another? Would it be worth it for the more expensive brands? Thanks for the input!"

Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"Another one:  Because after initial costs and configuration, it's 100% free to watch TV.  No monthly bills for OTA."
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,You can get antennas as low as $10 depending on where you live. 
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"One more reason:  OTA doesn’t use data where live streaming does and could potentially push you up against your limit if your internet provider has one.  I usually use my data for on-demand and OTA for live.There are also devices that enable you to broadcast live OTA TV through your wireless router so you can view live TV thru an app on your phone, tablet, Apple TV, Roku, etc.  this will also not count against your data cap since it doesn’t use data. "
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,good Advice.  i definitely want to go this route..  Just need to pick the right OTA DVR ...  *sigh* don't want one with monthly fees lol
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"Yes, a cheap OTA TV antenna (as little as $12 last time I checked) is a no-brainer for many people in the USA; but not all. Because the cost can go up dramatically in rural and/or mountainous areas. We live rural. And have a hill directly between us and the nearest broadcast towers, which effectively blocks the signal, so that nobody in our neighborhood has used an antenna for decades.However, back when we badly needed to cut the cord with cable, we took on the challenge. Now we're the first ever to get practical TV here. Around 25 channels. But it cost us around $600, and a ton of research and DIYing. And yeah: we get all the major broadcasters, plus their subsidiary channels. However, most of these channels are just as eaten up with commercials as cable TV. So these days we rarely use them for anything but convenient access to local weather news during storms. There's usually fewer commercials to be seen on free Roku channel alternatives to the antenna TV shows. At present I think we have around 100 free Roku channels (though I personally regularly use only a handful of them).We also have paid Netflix.The article is wrong about no blackouts/outages with antennas. Weather extremes can certainly cause outages. And certain sporting events held locally will be blacked out for us over the antenna. There's also a major local station here that fairly regularly goes down at the source, which is annoying.Of course, cable TV has outages too.Pic quality is often better via antenna than other ways, as the article says. But not always. Since some channels don't do high def. Or show old TV stuff that's low res.As far as OTA 3.0 is concerned, I wouldn't let that be a factor in decisions whatsoever, as I've seen politicians and companies over-promise and under-deliver on new TV and internet options for decades now. OTA 3.0 might amount to nothing at all; or only a worsening, rather than improvement."
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"> OTA 3.0 might amount to nothing at all; or only a worsening, rather than improvement.This promise has been kept.  It's already being broadcast in several cities, and being rolled-out across the nation with planned completion in Summer 2019.  It upgrades the image from 1080 HD to 2160 Ultra HD..... that's definitely a better image."
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,Why not share a coax cable with a few neighbors maybe and make back that money ?

Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"- I skip the commercials with my VCR's fast forward feature.  You'd probably use a DVR... same principle.-  The antenna also carries most of the shows I enjoy watching: New dramas from ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, CW...... and older dramas from the 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, early 2000s (like Stargate, Walking Dead, Sopranos, CSI, etc)."

Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"my grandparents have a summer cottage in an area with power being the only utility available, so they used OTA for many years, even before it went Digital. they even kept an old TV with an Antenna on it in their actual house, and it's come into use on a few occasions when the Cable provider cuts off the local news channel for stupid reasons."

Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"I'm gonna have to disagree with this one. OTA is a regressive technology and looks like shit. Most of us didn't go the route of getting an apple tv, roku, etc., to use exclusively and then have to rely on some dumbass looking antenna sticking out somewhere. Not to mention you have to use the remote on your TV to switch the input."
Why an Antenna Should Be a Part of Your Cord Cutting Setup,"> OTA is a regressive technology and looks like shit???.   It's broadcast in 1080 HD and looks better than most streamed HD that is overly compressed/blocky.   Plus within a few months OTA will be upgraded to ATSC 3.0 which features 2160p/ 4K Ultra HD.

Are we not in a worse situation now?,I don’t feel the need to subscribe to all those services. I have one or two at any given time and am happy as a clam. 
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Prime has many other benefits and coupled with Netflix, I’m good to go!"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Exactly. The greatest benefit of streaming is allowing you choice to what you want to purchase, rather than being forced to overpay for dozens of channels you don’t want just to get the few you do want. Also, as more content becomes exclusive to different streaming, they are going to have to compete for my business. I will choose what I want based on quality and price. I’m not going to get every service, so they better compete hard by making a great product at an affordable price or I won’t subscribe. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Yes and you can change which you are using from time to time to catch up on things that are exclusive if you want to see it.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,I agree with that plus the fact that you can cancel at anytime without having to do anything.  No having to call customer support and have them keep transferring you instead of canceling you.  No set top box that you have to turn in and then they say that you never turned it in.  
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I look at it like the 4 broadcast. I used to have faith that Fox was going to put up good action shows and animated. NBC does good drama and sit coms. And ABC has some good comedy. And CBS is just good for football. Netflix produces reliable quality material. Prime has some hits and misses, but you can expand it with the premium channels. Hulu has some reliable streams but rarely full seasons that you can’t find anywhere else. And YouTube, Facebook, and presumably apple’s material is all amateurish. So make concessions, you only need one or two to be satisfied. Any more is just hedonism. Lol"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"The question becomes how much you're actually saving by limiting your content consumption versus what it would cost to have it all through cable.I found that with YouTube TV and Netflix alone (in addition to standalone internet service provided by my cable company) my total monthly bill was pretty close to what I'd been paying before I cut the cord.  Adding a third service would have pushed it over the top.  Ultimately I choose to remain a cord cutter because I prefer cloud DVR to traditional DVR, but otherwise I would probably just be happier with cable, and my spending would be about the same despite having access to a lot more content."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This. Why do people feel that they have to have everything? If you need to see it all, just rotate services every few months. With the way things are, you have the option of spending a varying amount. Before, it was pay a lot all the time. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Many people were still paying high cable bills while being subscribed to a few of those services, so there are savings. If having all the same channel coverage is important to you, then maybe cord cutting isn’t your solution. Gotta take inventory of your viewing habits and decide if there are sacrifices you can make. We’ll never get a la carte channels because things are always packaged, but I do love not having 100 sports channels in my guide and foreign language networks overcharging me for their programming. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Ha, 100 sports networks are the one thing I miss from cable. I've never felt like I'm missing something until I try to watch football only to find out my team is playing on ESPN this week."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Yes. I was paying $110 a month for cable and had Netflix and Hulu as well since they have content I wanted that isn't on demand through cable. Now I only pay $11 for Netflix, $12 for Hulu, and buy 2 or 3 TV series each year that aren't available on either for $15-25 a pop. A $10 antenna gets me 40 OTA channels (~15 worth watching) for when I want to randomly flip or watch major events. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,">Netflix, Prime, Hulu, apparently Apple soon, and probably others I don't know about - all with exclusive content you have to pay to see.You don't HAVE to get them. You don't HAVE to get them all at the same time either, if you REALLY want to watch all the exclusive content, you can sub then unsub from one service a month and move to the next one, rinse and repeat. Nobody is forcing you to get any of them at all, and you do not have to pay for every service every month. I do not know why you think this is worse than being forced to pay for a single *higher* bill.And there have been premium channels for decades including HBO and Showtime with exclusive content that you were never forced to subscribe to either. You. Are. Not. Under. Contract."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"One advantage is that everything comes through the same internet connection. You can have 2 streaming services for a few months, then switch to 2 different ones, then back again, with seconds or minutes of work. Switching cable companies couldn't possibly be more of a pain, with calling call centers, waiting on hold, convincing them you really do want to switch, then calling someone else and setting up an appointment, having some dude all over your house installing boxes, etc. It doesn't make up for the problems you brought up, and obviously has its downsides, but it's still a solid advantage over cable."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"One thing I've found since getting rid of cable, is that I only watch TV when I'm watching a show I sought out. I don't sit down in front of the TV without knowing exactly what I'm gonna watch. And when I'm done I stop watching. It means I waste a lot less time watching TV now. TV is not bad in moderation but I think most people, especially Americans could stand to watch a little less."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This is my favorite thing, too. When we had cable, people would just turn the TV on reflexively and use it for background noise or just plop down and watch whatever came on. It was always on, and always playing something stupid. I hated that. It was a huge time suck for whoever was actually watching, and a constant annoyance to anyone who wasn't. We could still do that with the antenna now, but nobody wants to anymore. Someone at Netflix recently said that they were intentionally trying to recreate that experience with their autoplaying content. Just no. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"In a few years we’ll witness the birth of digital content aggregators that function similar to cable companies, it’s inevitable. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Apple TV has this already (sort of). On the main screen it has the “continue watching” or suggestions from platforms you subscribe to, ie netflix, Hulu etc. When you click on a show in there it opens whatever app you need and starts playing the show. Works really well!"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"""amazon channels"" is doing this I believe, if you have amazon prime you can add on HBO, Showtime, CBS, and like 50 other channels that I've never heard of but are there if you're fans of those particular nitches. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Oh this has already started happening with YouTube TV
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Competition is good for the consumer. Keeps prices low. 
Are we not in a worse situation now?,It would seem that way. Partnerships that push older content to streaming apps that syndicate a show (i.e. how Netflix started) will be mutually beneficial. Most of those lower cost offerings though are likely to be owned by the big parent company and are what we call a 'fighter' brand.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"TL;DR: Cord cutting is not necessarily about saving money.  While many people do save, some do not, and that's okay.Cord cutting doesn't work out financially for everyone.  People with vary wide-ranging tastes, who actually watch most of the channels they have, will likely be better off sticking with traditional subscription TV.  Big families are also frequently better off not cutting the cord, because some family members will like some channels, others will not, and among all of them a large portion of the content is regularly viewed.  For people who have a more narrow taste, or a small family, a lot of money can potentially be saved.  It's also not ONLY about saving money.  It's about user experience.  Some people are willing to pay more to have services that work on all devices and have more specialized or exclusive content available than more traditional services.  Personally?  Most of what I watch is on the big networks or Netflix.  So with an antenna and that one subscription, I have access to 75% of what I used to watch.  The other 25%?  I'm fine living without it, or only catching episodes on DVD after seasons end.  My local library tends to get full season DVD sets of most popular TV shows that I can check out for free.  Just have to be patient. One show I no longer have access to has an audio-only podcast that I listen to instead of watching the telecast, because it's a political discussion show so seeing the people talking isn't that important.   If I was dead set on accessing that last 25% still, then yeah, I'd have to subscribe to at least one more streaming provider and HBO.  I found that changing my habits slightly was worth the additional cost savings.  "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Well the quick answer is there are far more options now for what and how you like to watch. If you are looking to (legally) get everything that comes with cable, then cutting the cord may not be for you... but you have options and that's a good thing. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,You don't need to watch everything. Just pick one or two providers and watch their shows.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"And when you’re done, cancel subscription and move on to the next provider. So easy "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"pair it with an OTA DVR and you don't miss muchwith amazon prime (which i already have and use for the other benefits), netflix and an antenna I have more than I can watch already. Every now and then I'll use a trial for Hulu/sling/whatever or sign up for a month if there is a football game or something I don't want to miss, but I just cancel after. &#x200B;"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Not at all, most people don't watch 95% of the channels they were paying for but you didn't have a choice about pay for them. Now you actually have a choice on what shows you want to watch. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I genuinely will never watch 99% of the crap buried on Netflix or Prime (especially Prime...) - I'm paying for the 1%i do want to watch, and it'll be the same on any other provider."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"""...in order to have the same coverage of shows as cable/Sky, we'll have to be subscribed to multiple different providers...""There's your problem in a nutshell. You are stuck in yesterday's thinking. You are trying to recreate the cable-TV 200 channels available at once experience.Do you walk into a bookstore and moan, because you can't afford to buy every book and put it in your home library, even though you'll never have time to read them all? "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Actually, that's the beauty of having options not tied to an overpriced bundle. You can drop and add as you please and only subscribe to services with shows you want to see."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"The issue (at least here in Canada) for me was never cost...it was choice.  We had two television providers with essentially the same offerings and we had very little choice between providers and their offerings.  Now I can pick and choose services and providers as I choose.This sort of falls in line with the discussions I've had with coworkers and family members surround ""less than legal"" options.....there is no free TV, no free movies....for every option you have to avoid paying a traditional company, you will invest time in researching options, maintaining the service and possibly money in services to keep it running.  In many cases, the best option for people wanting a hassle free service and not willing to do the legwork is just to pay for cable....it actually blows my mind that the tradidional companies haven't seized on this as an advertising point....but I guess then I guess they'd need to admit there's other options out there."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"To be honest the free option is OTA.  I get about 35 channels but still subscribe to hbo, hulu, amazon and Netflix.  Yes, there are some shows I'd like to see but can't but screw it, I've got about 90% covered and more content than I could watch in a lifetime.  Sometimes it's ok to say no to your desires."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,">in order to have the same coverage of shows as cable/SkyThis is the fault in a lot of peoples view of what cordcutting should do. I never expected to get everything that's on cable and prior to Netflix, Hulu, and Prime Video being ubiquitously utilized as sources of content, the question that always bugged me the most was ""But what about \[show}? It's not available anywhere else, how can I watch \[show\] if I don't have cable?"" and my answer to that question was always ""Do you *need* that show? Or do you watch that show because it's what you're offered?"".I think it's safe to say that any two of the major streaming platforms offer the average person way more variety of entertainment than one person could reasonably enjoy. I have Netflix and Hulu and find myself having trouble keeping up with the shows I really want to watch on either of those services. I can't imagine being worried about the shows I don't have access to.Cordcutting isn't a replacement for cable, it's an alternative. We're definitely in a better situation than before, because we now have the choice of several platforms that cater to varying audiences. I'm glad to not pay for bullshit TV that I'll never watch just to get that 15% that I want."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Well put. I suppose we've just become used to accessing whatever we want.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Commercials are like cigarettes: they take years off your life!
Are we not in a worse situation now?,This is a strong point tbh... Hadn't really thought of the lack of adverts. I'm sure they'll turn up eventually though...
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Why do you have to have access to everything all the time?  That is the cable model where you pay for 400 channels to watch 20.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,True. But you still had access to the best content of all providers in one place. Now you need multiple subscriptions.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Absolutely not. Even if you subscribe to all the services you mention, you're not getting near the average monthly Sky bill. You're also not getting forced into a 12 month contract, meaning you can drop and renew services when convenient. Plus as others have said, competition breeds better prices and content for customers. Putting all your eggs in one company, say Netflix, is bad."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Here's what I've been doing. We keep Netflix and Hulu, and we get prime anyways for shipping, but if something has an exclusive, just wait for all the episodes to come out. I payed for one month of Seeso to watch MBMBAM, one month of CBS to watch Star Trek, then cancelled the service. If I want to re-watch them I'll sub back for just a month."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,This guy gets it.  I'll wait for a few seasons of star trek and then subscribe for a month and binge it.  Boom.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"It's still better - for now.I'm sure these companies will continue to chip away until it's just as bad as before, though."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"It's only worse if you believe you ""need"" to see all of this shit.That's ridiculous. We subscribe to Netflix for about 3 months out of the year and otherwise subscribe to Amazon Prime (we're in the UK, fyi).I have no interest in Hulu and I won't care about Apple. If it turned out that they had something I really wanted to see, I'd subscribe for a month or two and watch it, then end the subscription.I mean it's only worse if you have a mental disorder and are addicted to ""collecting"" subscriptions."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I think you’re right. If you still want a wide range of channels, you’ll end up paying more as a cord cutter.I like live sports which can require multiple subscriptions. The wife likes movies and AMC. The kids like Netflix. It adds up. If the wife and I were happy with what is on Netflix we’d be in good shape but so far, we don’t save by buying four or five different services."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I had all those with cable and was paying about $50-$65 more a month.  Now I have YTTV and drop in Philo, every third month, to catch up on shows.  I had Netflix and Prime with cable.  Prime video has improved 10x in the last year.  They have many more non original movies that I may have missed at the theater than Netflix.  I keep Netflix for the kid and the occasional original show that I enjoy.  I'm thinking about dumping Prime as I don't feel like the price increase is completely warranted unless you love buying things online.  If I wasn't a sports fan, I would only have OTA, Prime and Netflix."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I pay for Prime, Spotify, Youtube TV.My mother pays for Netflix and PS Vue.My sister pays for HBO.My ex-gf pays for Hulu.Works out for all of us."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I don’t have time to watch everything that comes out. Personally I could fill my TV time with just Netflix. I have prime too because of the free shipping. I get my news from YouTube  (Pbs). I also have ota and use Plex and hdhomerun to record the broadcast shows I really want to see. For me it is much cheaper. If you must have access to everything all the time  that’s going to be expensive no matter how you do it. Quality content needs to be paid for. At least with the new services you can decide how much you want to pay and get some high quality content at a low price and pay for what you want. No contracts, no hassle. Everything on demand. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,No.Because we are in control.I think the control of the subscriber is the key aspect of cord cutting that makes it so enticing.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"The sentiment that cord cutting should allow you to have exactly what you had for a lower price isn't truly cord cutting, at least as I see it. The whole reason I did it was that I hate junky, nonsensical television, but I was paying for it, and now I can just choose to pay for the more focused catalog that I want. Trade-offs are to be expected."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,This is a fair point. But I'm still concerned we're going to end up having to have multiple subscriptions to watch the best content.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I would have Hulu and Netflix even if I did still have cable because Hulu and Netflix have all the old shows you can't get from cable. So no, the situation isn't worse for me now."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I'm subscribed to them all and am still saving over $100/month compared w/ Dish Network.  And, I can come and go w/ those services w/o having to worry about a contract.  No, I am much better off."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Sure, if you get every service under the sun, but who watches all of that?  I actually have found that I watch a whole lot less TV ever since I've ""cut the cord.""  Yes, I still watch the shows that I ""have to watch,"" but only subscribe to those specific services for those specific shows. Also, take a look at Amazon Prime and iTunes (non streaming, download only).  You'll often find that instead of subscribing ""fullhog"" to a streaming service that buying the show a la carte comes out cheaper."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Hulu and Netflix together is around $20/mo. That's way cheaper than cable. 
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"For me, I wasn’t watching anywhere close to all my cable channels. Bill for cable only was > $200.(with internet over $300). Yes I now have a few subscriptions. Netflix I would have had for kids shows and their content. Starz wasn’t in my cable package, and we got it for outlander (prob should have just bought it). Got showtime for homeland.even with those my bill is still far less. My biggest complaint with cable is the lumping everything together to get you to buy channels you didn’t want. We also watch 1/10th the commercials, which with kids makes a big difference."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Honestly I would never pay for Sky. It’s just a bunch of channels that I’ve no interest in. Sports too is overpriced and not needed for me.The beauty of video on demand service is watching what you wanna watch when you wanna watch it. I reckon pick two providers and that will cover a lot of tv.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,That’s exactly how I saw it shaking out.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I like to rotate among the services I subscribe to, and I have a feeling I will be adding 1-2 more to that rotation.  I subscribe to three year-around (Netflix / Amazon / Hulu), and then a few others as noted above (ex: Starz / Hulu).  I also make heavy use of the library for a few shows where I do not want to purchase them nor subscribe to their service for one series."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"At least half of what I watch is free. But that's on a Roku, with its multitude of channels. For paid TV, I use only Netflix. And that's really enough for me, 99% of the time. Maybe if I had more free time, I'd want more. But even now, if I want something I can't get free on Roku, or through Netflix, I can usually take to my Windows PC and look on the net for it (for free, again). I can't think of any show I really wanted to see the past several years, that I couldn't get at via one of these methods.Of course, I'm not a sports addict, though. Anybody who is, may be at the mercy of the corporations. Sorry!"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Only if you sit around watching tv all day. Otherwise, why not join Netflix for a month, watch what you like then cancel. Join Hulu for a month, watch what you like, cancel. And on and on. Who really needs all services at the exact same time?"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This is the major advantage and money saver.  I have a couple that I watch all the time, so I'm subbed year round, but then there's others that i just watch a couple shows and sub for a month or two during the year.  Try cancelling part of your cable because you don't watch it year round."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"The difference (at least to me) is I don't mind paying money for services that I want. I subscribe to Hulu and Netflix which between my wife and I get used almost every day. I have Prime Video but I pay for prime for the shipping so to me Prime Video is just a bonus, and I get HBO free with my cell phone plan. Unlike with cable where I don't really have the freedom to modify my plan month to month, I can do that with my current services. I'll subscribe to the DC service when it comes out and the Disney service next year. But if they don't have what I want I'll just cancel them."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This is what I like to call the 'soup of chaos' where there's an explosion of competing offerings which quickly cools off to a handful of competitors and often one dominant champion - and its the third one we've seen since the invention of the FLV video player. It often happens once or twice in the lifecycle of a new technology, but a third time and in such a relatively short time frame is rare. The first version saw websites like Veoh (Disney and Time Warner), Vimeo, and my own GamersTube battling against each other and then against Google's YouTube for on demand videos and views. The second version was the different types of streaming videos which brought us offerings very different to YouTube such as Vine, Meerkat, Twitch.tv, Periscope, Live Stream, UStream, and Facebook Video. Throughout all of these first two versions Netflix stood relatively alone in their model and grew into the powerhouse they are today without having to be owned by another major tech corporation. That's a very difficult feat in today's internet where 'ecosystems' like Google, Amazon, and Facebook rule supreme. We're now deep into rare territory with a third 'soup of chaos' version since FLV and this time the big guys have all figured it out. Disney, AT&T, Comcast, CBS, Amazon, Sony, and Google all have subscription based streaming offerings and Viacom has one on the way. As long as consumers like entertaining content and are willing to subscribe for $5 to $25 / month, I don't see this trend slowing down. I remember back in the early internet days of 1993 my parents would get in arguments if the phone bill went up from the normal $35 ($20 for local phone and $15 for internet). Today I routinely pay around $100 for my phone plan and buy a new phone for between $600 and $850 every year. I used to buy video games for $60 and play them until I got a new game, I've spent that much on FortNite and Rocket League addons this year alone. Strangely the internet has increased our cost of communication and entertainment while simultaneously increasing our quality of life. That being said, I think this opens up a lot of options for content owners to monetize their content via syndication partnerships or niche subscription packages like the DC Universe option that just came out from Time Warner (AT&T).  I'm also curious who is going to purchase Curiosity Stream and other smaller early-adopters of the streaming app format."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"So potentially better for the content creators, which could lead to better content in the long run? I suppose competition is good, but I honestly see streaming services being clogged up by reality TV and talent shows in future..."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"In my opinion, the goal was to watch less programming and simplify my life. I still have Netflix for occasional viewing but I read more books and take more walks now instead of binging television programming that I really don’t need anyway."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Worse no, but it is not the dream we wanted. When HBO, Showtime, Disney, CBS, DC, Apple, Facebook, Youtube, etc... all have a small number of exclusives and don't bulk out their content with other content, it gets annoying. I'm not going to buy an apple device just to watch 1 apple show.The idea that people are constantly switching out services for 1 show, maybe that works when you aren't married or have kids, but when your household is more than yourself you prefer the consolidated content of a Netflix, Amazon & Hulu over these single source content providers."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I'm saving $100 a month, not missing a single thing I watch, and have more flexibility and better hardware.  I'm good"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"You can subscribe to a services, binge on their exclusives, and cancel before the second month bills."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I don't want to haggle every 6-12-24 months to lower my ""double play"" rate so I can have the ""new customer"" rate. It's stupid and arguably unethical to charge long standing customers a higher rate than a newbie.I like the setup I have:* Amazon Prime* Sling* Comcast (until 5G comes along)I'm good...and it's cheaper for me than cable+tv would run unless I whined to the Comcastic overlords."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I only pay for Netflix so I'm very happy I don't have to buy one large cable offering, I can just buy what I want."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"You say we now need ""multiple providers"" to get ""the same coverage"" as cable but that's not even remotely true. How quickly we forget how much less content was available when cable was the only option. Hulu, Prime, Netflix, etc are additive:[http://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fx-chart-890x660.jpg](http://static.adweek.com/adweek.com-prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fx-chart-890x660.jpg)"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Even when I subscribed to cable I still had netflix and prime because they have stand-alone value that is higher than the price.  I've never been interested in Hulu but I do subscribe to Sling.  I get what I want to see for $25 / month vs. $80 / month.  It is a pretty good deal.  And what cable package ever covered ""everything the studios put out""?  Most of their programming is useless crap.  I don't need 300 channels if 260 of them are just bullshit made up so the cable company can claim to have more channels."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"If you have FOMO, especially on network stations, then cutting is not for you IMO. If you want the same coverage of shows, then just stick with what you had."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,You’re just doing it wrong. Subscribe to one or two services at a time and watch the shows they have that you want to see. Then when you finish that up go to another service and watch their content. There’s no reason why you would need to subscribe to 5 different streaming services at one time. There’s no way you’re watching all of that content in a month. Especially with how services are moving to produce their own original content - the movies and shows they produce are going to remain on their platform long term. So you won’t have to worry about a show leaving the service before you make it around to subscribing to it. 
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Where I live I get 15 channels off 2 directional antennas. Local news x4, Local weather x2, three or four PBS stations, and some local sports and misc stuff. &#x200B;If you are a TV buff who has to watch all the best shows on HBO, Hulu, etc, then I couldn't see cord cutting being worth it. that being said, for some people (me included) I don't watch a lot of channel prime time programming, I don't care about watching a show the day it airs, etc. &#x200B;I have prime already, so I get prime video. I also have Netflix to watch a few shows on there, other than that? I just stream everything from my media center pc to the TV. &#x200B;It depends on your priority. If you want to watch every sports broadcast there is, might be best to keep cable. I can't pay that much for what is essentially watching the news at dinner and that's it. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I was thinking the same thing.I am interested in Jack Ryan on Amazon Prime. I am also interested in some of the original programming on Netflix. When Handmaid's Tale was active, I needed a Hulu account. When Star Trek Discovery comes back, I'll need to subscribe to CBS All Access. And then there's content from premium TV channels: my wife wants to watch Bill Mahar and John Oliver on HBO, and I like Homeland on Showtime.It hasn't been too bad yet as most of shows haven't overlapped. I was able to switch from CBS All Access to Showtime (and Homeland) once Star Trek ended. But its only a matter of time before I'd need to subscribe to all of these for the programming I want. Now Disney is getting into the act with a live action Star Wars series that will be exclusive to their upcoming streaming service.I am currently subscribed to Amazon Prime for Jack Ryan, which is $13 per month. I don't use Amazon for much else, and Prime Video is mostly junk (IMO) so I am basically paying $13 per month for one TV show. I'd like to watch the live action Star Wars show, but I don't think I'd be interested in anything else.The price starts adding up, and eventually I'll get to the point where I'll have to pick and choose what I want. And I won't watch some shows I want to watch, unless I'm willing to wait and just binge on shows one service at a time. And that sux."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,No.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Exclusivity is the enemy. It prevents competition. But it is way more beneficial to cut ties to the shows/networks that won't play ball. Watch the stuff that is doing it right, even if it isn't the best out there. Until we change our habits and enforce it with our wallets, nothing is going to change. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,I share my amazon prime and hulu account with my brother. He shares his netflix with me. Maybe there is someone you can piggy back off of?
Are we not in a worse situation now?,the secret ingredient is crime- Super Hans
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Not at all. To get the full package of Sky you need to sell a kidney a month. I just don't have those kind of resources.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"This is why I work with family and friends, I share my Netflix with my sister, she shares her Hulu with me.  I have prime already because I'm am Amazon Junkie."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"> in order to have the same coverage of shows as cable/Sky, we'll have to be subscribed to multiple different providers...You are 100% correct.  The problem is that most on this forum DON'T want the same coverage.  We only want 3-4 channels (or 3-4 shows), so it's cheaper to subscribe to Hulu for $8 or Sling for $25 (versus paying for a bunch of channels we don't watch)- You should try it.  Just limit yourself to one service + antenna TV and see how it works. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,It's easier to avoid advertising now. I don't mind paying a little extra for that.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"If I may...Most of these providers offer the ability to be on \~5 devices (some more, some less)What my family and friends have done is this:Determine which services we value the most based off how much they cost (almost all of them are around 10 a month)Delegate each service to a different family member.For instance; my in-laws take care of Prime, my mom takes care of HBO go, and we pay for netflix. And we all just share the Passwords on each.Granted it becomes a nuisance when one of the kids logs into a different device and we have to log back in on the TV, but it basically guarantees you 3 or 4 different services for \~10$ a month. &#x200B;Just a suggestion, take it for what you will. That being said, I agree it does get out of hand, especially with Apple throwing their hat in the ring. HBO and Netflix IMO have the best programming. Prime has a few good shows too. Never really was all that fond of HULU considering I have all the seasons of Seinfeld already. TipTipTallyO (that's what y'all say in the UK right?)"
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"All of these streaming services are just in their infancy, and probably yes, depending on what and how much you want, cable bill *could* be cheaper.So yeah go back to cable, no one's shaming you. It seems to me that Cord cutting is really for people who are ok with having limited options."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"There's lots of great content from all kinds of places, writers and artists have more opportunities than ever to get shows and movies made. And I love having the choice of subscribing to what I want rather than having cable co decide for me. However, I do agree that discovery is miserable and there is even more junk to sort through on a jumble of services. I'm also starting to feel like there are way too many ""shows"" and not enough movies - people are getting too lazy to edit. We are watching the First on Hulu, an interesting concept about getting to Mars with some great acting - but I feel like it could have been a great 2.5 or even 3 hour movie, and instead it is a dragging 8 pt series. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"You can always rotate which services you have,  i don't think netflix, hulu, youtube , (hbo?) are yearly contracts.    sign up before your favorite shows come out,  (watch some others too that aren't must haves) and switch ..   personally I'm actually pretty good with just having netflix but hey "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Just don't subscribe to all of those 
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Even before we dropped our $150/month Dish Network service we already had Hulu, Netflix, and Prime, so cutting Dish actually did help.  The way I look at it I watch TV not for specific shows (mostly), but rather for content.  I'll watch shows on the providers we have, and if Apple or any others decide to lock-up their content behind yet another provider we just won't watch it.   Growing-up we never had cable, just the OTA networks so that's all we watched.  I will subscribe to CBS All Access when Discovery starts back up in January, but as before as soon as the season Finale airs I'll get cancelled -- Trek is about the only thing I will pay extra for...  "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Anyone that thought streaming would provide you the same experience as cable but be much cheaper were fooling themselves. Content OWNERS control the price and distribution of content not the cable companies
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Not until they introduce contracts
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Rather than watching one company slowly sneaking your bill ever higher, you've got 3-5 conspiring against you. "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"As an individual, yes!  Gotta have family mate."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,Not yet
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Unpopular opinion here but you could also look at it as more choice and freedom. You don't have to watch everything or at least subscribe to all services at the same time.People wanted a la carte and now they are starting to see what that will look like.People still have the option to keep cable/satellite service. If we are being honest, if someone wants it all it is probably a better option than cordcutting. At least the cordcutting is driving price cuts in that market."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,As long as none of them force you to sign a contract then you are better off.  You can just rotate in one per month and catch up on any new shows that have came out since the last time you subscribed to that service.  Plus between Netflix and HBO you are getting some quality stuff you would have never gotten in the past.  I mean I like The Odd Couple and Friends but none of that really compares to Ozarks and Game of Thrones.
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"Yes and no. Even if you assume that you NEED to subscribe to all of the content, you have to also take into account the QUALITY of that content. Netflix, Amazon, etc., are now producing a lot of high quality content that would never have made it to air otherwise. So yes, if you want to see all of it, you may wind up paying as much or more than you were previously, but what you're seeing will be much better too."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"It might be worse if you need everything. But for folks that just needed a little bit, but were forced to pay for everything it's great now.   "
Are we not in a worse situation now?,"I agree op. I noticed when networks pulled their shows from Netflix, that the s*** was about to hit the fan."
Are we not in a worse situation now?,You wanted a la carte. Here it is. What did you think a la carte meant?

Antenna not picking up ABC,"Post your TV Fool reportAlso, what model of antenna are you using?"
Antenna not picking up ABC,Just edited my post.
Antenna not picking up ABC,"Please post your [TVFool](https://tvfool.com) report and what antenna you're currently using, we might be able to help you get it  OTA.Completely remove your signal booster if you have one attached just to rule that out for now. Sometimes those make things worse.Also look at the [FCC reception map](https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps) to determine if ABC in your area is using VHF-Low which is a bit more difficult to get even at 10 miles.Someone here may be able to give you specific help with VHF reception if you determine that it is the case."
Antenna not picking up ABC,Posted TVF report and antenna as an edit. FCC map shows it as using Hi-V if I'm looking at the right spot.
Antenna not picking up ABC,"Which direction is the front of your TV facing?The CBS station is coming out of the South/South-~~West~~East, so there might be something soaking up the signal, or creating interference, in that path."
Antenna not picking up ABC,My TV is facing west. It is right next to a window too. Not sure if that matters at all.
Antenna not picking up ABC,"Alright, so, a few questions:1. Does ABC come in well? ABC and CBS are both in the VHF-Hi band.2. Does PBS and Fox come in well? They are all coming from the same 166 degree direction but all on the UHF band.If yes to both, then you have an issue with reception of VHF-Hi signal coming from the 166 degree direction (aka, just the CBS station). You have a few options, but my guess is the location behind the TV is going to be the culprit. Start by removing the amplifier. If there is a lot of noise at the CBS frequency, this can amplify the noise and hurt your cause. If that doesn't work, I would move the antenna somewhere else. For test purposes, try in front of a window that faces the west/southwest/south direction. If you get all the signals in that case, then you know you don't have to go outside with the antenna.Given the TV fool report, you should be able to acquire ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, and Fox without much issue. Whether that requires an outdoor antenna or not will be the result of your testing, but don't give up. Try moving the antenna around to different locations (height matters also).Here are some other helpful suggestions for obtaining VHF-hi stations - https://www.tvtechnology.com/expertise/solving-vhf-dtv-reception-problems"
Antenna not picking up ABC,The answer to both of those questions is yes. I figured putting it behind the TV was going to hose me. With where my TV is located I really don't have a whole lot of options for antenna placement without punching holes in the wall to hide the cables. The wife doesn't want to see any cords coming from behind the TV let alone an antenna stuck to the window. I will keep testing. I appreciate the help.
ABC local,"6ABC Philly is super hard to pick up as it is VHF-Low. My 1ByOne antenna most of the time is able to pick it up (I am in South Jersey about 15 miles directly south from the tower). [1byOne antenna here.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IF70QCW/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_IQrTBb3B4SDW0)I added Locast to my Roku which doesn't have Philadelphia yet (coming soon), but it lets me watch New York's ABC so if there are  national abc shows or college football you want to watch you can try to watch them on there. If it's local news and stuff you are looking for on ABC then you'd have to go the Vue/Yttv/DTVNOW route if you can't get it through antenna. "
ABC local,I had it a couple weeks ago but it kept fading out. I moved the antenna around and lost it. I was getting Fox pretty good for a while but now it's gone too. But I get Fox through Sling. I not sure if all this rain is helping me either.
ABC local,"If you're taking about 6ABC(WPVI), then unfortunately, the cheapest options to get it live are the $40 minimum OTT cable services like YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and DirecTV Now.If you can post your TVFool report and what antenna you're currently using, we might be able to help you get it via OTA though."
ABC local,SlingTV likely has your local ABC affiliate.
ABC local,"If he's talking about 6ABC in Philadelphia, then unfortunately no, Sling doesn't have it."
ABC local,ABC is a VHF-low band signal that your existing attic antenna is not designed to pick up. Could you get something like one of these up there:* Channel Master CM3016* Channel Master CM5016
ABC local,I'll think about it. I really want to stay inside with it though. Thanks
ABC local,http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29&q=id%3d9038b76d287250I have a GE 29884 Pro outdoor/attic antenna in the attic.Thanks

Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),I’m consistently running close to my comcast terabyte data cap every month now. Netflix uses close to 10GB an hour for 4K content plus anything else my family does on the internet including Hulu and amazon prime video. Comcast knew what they were doing when they put the terabyte cap in place. At the time it seemed like plenty but now it’s not and they want $50 more a month for true unlimited data
Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"Comcast originally imposed a 300 GB cap.  Of course that was before 4k video even existed (outside of studios), so it was enough."
Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"Netflix runs their own custom CDNs, where they install boxes right at the ISP's locations,  or very likely in the case of comcast, at their various nodes. That means that Netflix data isn't as costly as an average packet since it doesn't have to hop as far, and thus doesn't take as much total bandwidth"
Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"Same here with Cox.I can see the game as clear as day. People are cutting the cord in droves, so the telecoms who for the most part provide cable services and internet are trying to compensate for the revenue they're losing.Considering most Americans only have 1 viable internet provider in their area, you're put in a situation that if you want to cut the cord and still stream data you need to purchase an unlimited plan.Then there are those who aren't as up on the scam who have cable but also stream a lot of data who are getting hit with cap overage fees. We desperately need to elect more tech savvy politicians who are consumer advocates as well. We have a lot of anti-consumer and pro-corporation politicians but there's also a group who are pro-consumer and don't understand how this effects a regular Americans. Especially young Americans who stream a lot of data and watch less television. Which is why I'm happy in my state (Nevada) Jacky Rosen is running for senate because she has a tech background. We need a lot more of that across the country."

Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"I usually get pretty close, but ever since they have implimented that stupid 1024GB data cap I have made sure to get 1000-1020GB every month by just wasting data on stupid shit because hey if I'm paying for that much I am damn well going to use every last GB. I also hope that in doing so it increases the average usage and they decide to raise the cap... as if Comcast would ever do such a thing."

Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"That's not even the part that annoys me the most. Netflix doesn't exist in a vacuum.

Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"Yeah, all those cables and routers and switches and data centres cost nothing to run. Internet is finite, it costs more to add capacity, especially somewhere like Australia where we have to build submarine cables to transport a lot of data, which aren’t exactly cheap to build."
Netflix Eats Up 15% of All Internet Downstream Traffic Worldwide (Study),"No, ISP customers use 15% of all internet traffic watching Netflix because hey, that's a large part of why they pay for high speed internet.  Framing it as though Netflix is the user is an ISP trick that they use to double dip.Video just takes substantially more bandwidth than other media.  I'll bet YouTube is pretty high up there too."

Roku Is Getting Big Enough to Be a Buyout Target. Here’s Who Might Want It,"Why would Amazon want it though? Besides for the purpose of eliminating a competitor. Amazon already has its own devices, platform, and OS. Besides Roku's ad platform and user data, there really isn't much that doesn't already overlap with something Amazon already has.Similar with Google, but they even already have *two* TV device platforms, and an existing ad business.

But the first three I mentioned are in a potion right now where their competitors have a advantage. Amazon have amazon prime. Direct TV have direct now and is apart of ATT so both dish and verizon are disadvantaged. Dish does have sling but I believe it wont perform well compared to the growth of netflix,hulu,amazon prime. Odd ball chances might be  disney or apple but I think those wont happen. The one i believe who would use roku to its advantage would be verizon.

Hulu Live,"Just curious, what sports stations do you need that Hulu Live doesn't offer?"
Hulu Live,Hulu’s greatest weakness is that it costs you an additional $15 a month plus tax if you want to be able to skip commercials. That’s quite a bit when added to the base $39.99.
Hulu Live,And that $15/mo is only for skipping commercials for programs recorded to the DVR.  It doesn't cover the no commercials add-on for on demand content.  I just went ahead and got both because I really hate commercials so it ends up being $39.99 + $14.99 + $4.

Technical advice needed - help organizing components and services.,"1)  You only list Netflix, Amazon Prime, and CBS All Access for services.  As far as I know all of those run on the Apple TV.  I'm not sure what you're switching between or turning on/off in this scenario.&#x200B;2) I'll second the  Hauppauge WinTV HVR-1265  for a tuner card.  I used one a while back with good results&#x200B;3) I can't recommend the Harmony Hub enough.  It should work with everything you have listed.  For the PC you'll need to either add an IR receiver, like a FLIRC dongle, or connect with bluetooth.  If you're running Windows you can use things like Eventghost and AutoHotKeys to help fill in most of the gaps that come with using a remote with a PC.&#x200B;4) What apps are you using, and on which devices?&#x200B;I know you said you'd like to have most of this going through the PC, but in my experience, HTPCs just don't compare to the set top box experience.  If you can get the apps you want on your Apple TV I think you'll have a better overall experience using that for watching content, and using the PC as a DVR backend/NAS.  If you really want to go down the path of using your PC for everything though, /r/HTPC might be a good sub to check out."

They're basing what locals you get on the geolocation of your IP, which they get from a geolocation database. I checked my IP adderss Geolocation.

Signed up for Youtube.tv AND DirectvNow to test. Questions...,"You are correct about the commercial situation on YouTube. But it doesn’t apply across the board. The VOD mandate typically only occurs on first-run, prime time programming on major networks. NBC is the worst about it with the DVR version almost never available. CBS shows usually drop the VOD after a few weeks. Right now, Fox and ABC programs allow you to watch the DVR version and skip commercials. This doesn’t apply at all on sports programming, off-network reruns, most talk, game shows and local programming.  The degree of annoyance really depends on what you watch.  Directv Now DVR is limited to 20 hours of storage and all recordings are deleted after 30 days. It gives you very little control over the type and number of episodes recorded. If you want to record a few episodes of The Big Bang Theory, you could find your entire DVR library wiped out in a day or two as it records reruns of TBBT off a variety of networks. And there are repeated instances of programs not recording at all, shortened recordings, poor quality recordings. DTVN calls it a “beta”, but reality is the DVR has been in beta since at least August 2017. Why they can’t get it right remains a mystery. DTVN was promising an expanded DVR option (supposedly by Summer 2018) with more storage and longer retention for an extra fee. YTTV gives you unlimited recording space and stores recordings for 9 months. I spent more than a year on DTVN before switching to YTTV due to their utter inability to fix everything wrong with the service. The highest praise you’ll ever hear for DTVN is that the price is great—usually from AT&T wireless customers who get discounts or those who are on grandfathered pricing. That’s basically the only selling point for DTVN right now. In terms of ease of use, features, supported devices and reliability, it’s at the bottom of the barrel. "

Signed up for Youtube.tv AND DirectvNow to test. Questions...,"I had DirecTV Now for a few months not too long ago on an Apple TV 4K hooked up via ethernet, with a great internet connection. Streams cut out and the DVR was unreliable. DTVN's guide sometimes failed to load too. I've also tried other services. YouTube TV is a stable service with a simple interface. As far as DVR recordings reverting to VOD, it depends on the network. My recordings of Better Call Saul on AMC were ""latest aired"" live versions that let me skip commercials (same with sports). Vue, Fubo, and Hulu with Live TV are good choices as well. Some people pair Philo ($16) with their live tv provider for certain channels missing from the above services. I ended up choosing Fubo due to MSG Networks (NY regional sports channel). I like the balance they offer between sports and other entertainment. One ""downside"" would be no espn, but I personally don't care. No matter which you choose, you can use your live tv account to sign into many network apps for live and on demand content. "

Season Pass release timing,"Every service is different. It could be a one time delay or the standard for the specific network or show. If it happens consistently it's likely to be expected. I had the same issue with Amazon on a rare occasion. Unfortunately, there is a TOS that states the show will be available within a certain period. Unfortunately, that period could be 24 - 48 hours. Check Google Plays TOS. You won't have much recourse if the show is available within that time frame."
Season Pass release timing,"If isn't the Service's fault.  Some channels impose a blackout period.  Back when I had both Hulu and Time-Warner on-demand the Syfy Channel imposed 7 days, because they wanted people to watch live."
Season Pass release timing,“If it happens consistently it’s likely to be expected.” May I steal this from you? I would like to start using that phrase at work. 
Season Pass release timing,"Google Play is usually the morning after.  Google says that it is left up to the network when it gets released.I've had a couple of issues with Google Play as that is my preferred service as well.  I liked the show *The Librarians*, and Google Play didn't keep a consistent release time with it. Again, it's usually made available the morning after it airs.  It's more often than not the case, but sometimes things can be wonky."

Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,"Gotta love the benefits of competition. Three years ago my monthly bills for internet, wireless (5 lines), landline and video services totaled over $400. Now, it's about $150 less for better service, more flexibility and redundancy of all services.Most of the price reduction came from the wireless sector where competition has been robust. I look forward to the additional benefits and cost savings coming soon from 5G."
Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,5G is going to be a real problem to get rolled out to the public. I wouldn’t be holding my breath for it. It’s so prone to interference that you need essentially line of sight between the user and the access point. It would take millions of repeaters all over a city to provide reasonable wireless broadband over 5G.

I get this for watching TV, but what about gaming and other devices? Between me and my three kids, that's four phones, four tablets, two Xbox's and a Playstation, not to mention Amazon Fire TV and Chromecast.

Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,Has anyone cut their home internet for just mobile?
Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,"With 5G starting to roll out with 100X the current speeds I can see people dropping their wired Internet and using mobile always-on services for their provider.  The biggest hang-ups though are providers still cap their services from what I've seen... at least none of the wireless providers I'm aware of have truly unlimited data with no throttling.  And second what about those household items that depend on the Internet like Amazon Echo, Google Home, Roku, etc.  Does that mean someone would have a smartphone or something like a Mifi at home always on? And if so what's so different between this and a wired connection when it comes down to it?  The biggest reason so many people cut the cord was cost... When we dropped Dish 2 years ago we were spending $150/month for 3 TV's and DVR's, and going to three Rokus and Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime (which we already had anyway) dropped that $150/month.  Internet though we're paying about $55/month, and I don't see how a wireless provider could offer this at least with the plans I've seen around now'days.  Even Google Fi would be $60/month for data given you use 6 Gigs or more which I'd assume most would.  I could see some benefits in this though as you could take devices anywhere.  I've always thought dropping the Cell service for just an always on data connection using VOIP would be ideal (Google Voice for example).  One could use a Tablet, deactivated cell phone, or even an iPod Touch which costs WAY less than an iPhone.  "

Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,"Important thing to keep in mind, replacing your existing modem/router with a 5G-based router isn't really cord cutting.  Its just moving to a different ISP, no different than ditching cable TV for satellite TV.

Here Comes the Third Wave of Cord Cutting: Home Internet Service,"I'd say it's pretty literally cord cutting.  Having said that, I've used an unlimited att data sim in my phone with hotpspot and it works pretty well as an internet replacement.    It's definitely a different mindset, and it breaks some always connected paradigms that people have gotten used to with fixed internet, but having a user centered access model rather than a location centered one is probably the new norm.

Amazon is already making enough of us nervous with the Echo thing, I'll never own one btw, listening all the time. The fact that we are so fucking complacent that we allow devices from companies we know nothing about to listen and watch us is pretty sickening if I'm being honest. We pretty much all have smartphones that do enough listening from our own pockets, why are we literally doing everything we can to willfully expand that?

The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,Spoiler: it does not integrate into content search. It gets its own tab unrelated to universal search.
The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"So from the comments section on The Verge I gathered this device creates an interface that takes all of the apps from the devices you plug in to the 4 HDMI ports and uses it to access the content.  It's a remote that uses cec, network and IR signals.Sounds great at $99 if it weren't for the monthly/yearly fee Edit: The FAQ on the CAAVO site does say it'll weird without the Service Plan ""but without voice, content guides, universal search or deep linking.  You can still switch seemlessly been your devices and launch your linked apps and services from the Control Center.""So it basically will still be a shared hub for your devices and apps with 1 remote."

The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"If not for the fee, this would be a $3-400 device, though.IMHO, it's a solution in search of a problem.  Most people don't have more than 2-3 streaming services and other devices that they connect (ignoring game consoles, where the 30ms lag on this device would be a non-starter), and interfaces like FireTV and Roku already do a good enough job of managing your different apps, even if they can't see into them to know what's on your playlists."

The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"I still haven't completly wrapped my head around what this does.... but you have certainly missed the boat on it.It is supposed to be the ultimate learning remote.The AI is because there is no standards on how these boxes pass  - or even if they pass - information.As an example.Apple has no built in way for the remote to launch its app from within the APPLE TV box.So the learning AI opens the Apple TV and scans the menu looking for its icon - then presses its icon.You tell it you want to watch 'Iron Man' and it tells you that you own it on Disney Marvel and Plex.Most importantly - It has 4 HDMI ports that all feed into your TV's single port.  The learning thing has all your devices on and just works the HDMI ports as needed.  Effectively, Tivo, Amazon Fire and Steam Link are all on the same port.  "

The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"I also ordered this today.  I've been using a Harmony Ultimate remote to control my 4 piece system (TV, A/V Receiver, Apple TV, Nintendo Switch and BluRay).  I'm most interested in the built in voice control features.  (I know you can integrate the Harmony Remote with Alexa, but our Alexa is in a different room and we didn't want to buy another)  We recently switched from Optimum TV to FIOS.  We struggle trying to remember the channels for the networks we watch frequently and found it clumsy to use the icons on the Harmony remote.  It would be easier to just talk to the remote, like we do with the Apple TV remote.  Also, the voice control ability to search for programs across our devices  and apps seems very appealing."

The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"I received mine today. I’m intrigued by it, but I don’t love it. I’m going to give it a chance to improve but the software experience is super basic, often slow and colors freak out and get way over blown. (Maybe mine’s defective?) - not worth the $20 a year subscription, imoVudu doesn’t appear to be supported when using Apple TV Nor PS4. Can’t find mention of it on the Caavo site, though. Their support site makes It clear that app and device support is fragmented. Some apps behave with full functionality on one device, but could be limited in functionality on another.The watch history functionality only keeps track of where you are, in a series, if you launch the show from the Caavo interface. If you popbinto Hulu (or any other app) just from your device (Apple TV, etc.) interface, it won’t keep up to date since it’s not tracking your clicks if not initiated from their menu system. Kind of a deal breaker to what could have been a killer feature, but it makes sense. FAQ on their site explaining why the experience is slower on Apple TV  than on other devices. If you plan to mainly use Apple TV, I recommend checking their FAQ pages before you buy. The remote has pluses, and works really well, but the thing feels cheap. As it stands now, I can’t not notice it. The feeling of the shiny plastic is bugging me, and the size isn’t my favorite. Button layout is great. Love the feature where it’ll show you the buttons function, on tv, when you lightly hover your thumb over the button, before you press. "
The $99 Caavo Control Center is a universal remote built on machine vision,"Is it me or are manufacturers having a problem with AI?Given that they have it, they feel compelled to shoehorn it into everything.

TVFool report and AntennaWeb recommendation,"Omni antennas have a poor reputation. Good TV reception is as much about avoiding bad signals as getting the signal in the first place and an omni gets everything from everywhere. That includes all the available reflections and noise. All your interesting signals are coming from the southeast anyway, so there is no reason to consider an omni.You might have to move the antenna around in the attic to get the best reception. It would be hard to predict what spot would work best ahead of time. Check for things that can block TV signals such as radiant barrier and metallic ducting. A reasonable strategy is to temporarily check attic reception by  running the cable up through the attic hatch. If the attic doesn't work out you could consider the roof as plan B.>... a satellite dish ...Is there an existing cable and dish mount available for reuse with a TV antenna?Based on your signal strength and TV bands in use at your location (UHF, VHF-high), here are some antenna suggestions:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018"
TVFool report and AntennaWeb recommendation,"The satellite dish is still in use, so the mounting hardware and cable would certainly be available for reuse once I make the decision to pull the plug, but it’s pretty low; since the dish was aiming at the sky, and there are no trees or taller buildings in that signal path, the dish was mounted so as not to be visible to my neighbors.  That’s certainly a location I can try, but I think the corner of my own house will block the signal from the terrestrial antennas. I’ll take a look at those antennas, thanks!  You’re right, all the signals I would try to capture are to the southeast, within a few degrees of arc. In a PERFECT situation, with no obstructions between the broadcast towers and my antenna, how close to perfect would my aim have to be?  Could I just use the compass on my phone as an alignment tool?  Or would this be the sort of thing where that’s overkill, and I could just point the antenna generally southeast, and I’d get pretty much the same results as if I tried really hard?I’m sorry to be asking such basic questions, but like I said, this is essentially new territory for me, because the memories of using an outdoor antenna on a tower that sounded like “ka-CHUNK, ka-CHUNK, ka-CHUNK” every time we had to re-align it are not exactly fresh.

Era of free TV is coming to a close. :(,>Maybe I should tap into the pre-existing sat-comm dish with an OTA receiver?Not sure how that would work. For FTA you would need a different LNBF (linear vs circular) and probably a different dish to attach it to. With a small dish (Ku band)) you could potentially get NBC (with weird audio) and PBS. With a big dish (C band) you could get more.* http://ftalistings.com/If you wanted to try getting your weak TV signals you would want an antenna like this:* Winegard HD7698P... and probably a preamp. Semi-random examples:* Winegard LNA200* RCA RCATVPRAMP1R (has separate VHF/UHF inputs)* Channel Master CM7778* Electroline EDA 2100 (optional power inserter: EDA-ICF)
Era of free TV is coming to a close. :(,"> With a small dish (Ku band)) you could potentially get NBC (with weird audio) and PBS.Just so you know, the weird audio is fixable, in real time if you are use a DVB-S2 satellite tuner card connected to a computer, or after the recording is completed if you are using a regular FTA satellite receiver with PVR capability, by using ffmpeg with some specific options.With C-band (big dish) you can get a lot more although C-band's future is a bit cloudy because the FCC plans to allow those same frequencies to be used by terrestrial users.As for an antenna, at those distances he really doesn't stand a chance of getting those stations reliably unless he has a very tall tower - I know this from sad experience.  I have a top rated antenna and a preamp on a tower over 50 feet high and it still won't pull in signals reliably for areas that are listed as ""2Edge"" or beyond on tvfool.  Some days they come in great, most days you lose signal several times during an hour show, and some days they will barely come in at all.  Makes trying to watch TV a frustrating and non-enjoyable experience."

Era of free TV is coming to a close. :(,"The math is straight-forward. You want to receive signals around -90 dBm for UHF (NBC, CBS, Fox) and close to -100 dBm for VHF (ABC). Your TV needs signals of about -65 dBm (maybe a little less, maybe a little more). A low noise amplifier (1 dB or 2 dB noise figure) will get you to about -75 dBm. The rest of the gain has to come from the antennas. You need antenna gain of about 15 dB for UHF and about 25 dB for VHF channel 13 (if you want ABC).The UHF is obviously easiest, Here's a 4-bay commercial UHF antenna with 17.5 dB gain: https://www.solidsignal.com/pview.asp?p=HDB8X&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cse&utm_term=hdb8x&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvo_v5-Pn3QIV0EwNCh0ULwPhEAQYAiABEgKyzfD_BwEChannel 13 (ABC) is tougher. You'll need a single-channel VHF antenna. The highest gain antenna I find with a quick Google search provides only 13.2 dB of gain. (BTY-10-HB https://www.sateng.com/shared-downloads/SEG-5214860109-bty.pdf ) This antenna has a length of 106"". Even stacking four of them in a phased array will only provide an extra 6 dB of gain (19.2 dB) which isn't enough according to your TV Fool report. Seems like any extra gain beyond that needs to come from a higher mast. Your TV Fool report can help with that.Good luck. Please report results."

However if it was previously used with Dish Network or DirecTV or a similar service then it it probably too small to deliver a reliable signal, even on the Ku band.

And if you have a large C-band dish then you are king of the skies (at least until the FCC effectively shuts down C-band by allowing ground communications on the same frequencies).If you have decent Internet you might want to look into streaming options, using a Roku or similar device, which are discussed in other threads in this sub and elsewhere."

"Disney plans to sink proceeds from Fox's RSN, Sky sales into OTT products",This would be a shame. Hulus VOD library is pretty vast — you get a lot of bang for your buck with their no commercials plan.
"Disney plans to sink proceeds from Fox's RSN, Sky sales into OTT products",Disney can control everything about Hulu now though. It’s an already huge and fast growing platform (by raw number counts). They can literally sink Hulu into huge losses in the next few years and put the heat on Comcast. Disney is in a much better position to take the losses than Comcast which is now over 100 billion in debt. I think Hulu is relatively safe. They are the number two streamer in the US now. Disney and Comcast May hate each other but they’re better of letting it grow and just taking the proceeds and viewership info that they’re no doubt collecting   
"Disney plans to sink proceeds from Fox's RSN, Sky sales into OTT products",">Hulu may not be long for this world, if they keep this up.Would this not be a double edged sword, Disney might care less but does Comcast have a solid OTT offering. AS much as they might not want to help Hulu if it dies it only would allow Disney to focus even more on their own OTT service."

California gov. signs nation’s strictest net neutrality rules into law,"I am somewhat in a quandary regarding this.  On one hand I can see how companies would be more efficient with regulations which go across all 50 states.  On the other side, I am a firm believer in state rights (and the federal government has taken too many of them away).

Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"It's been 10 months or so for us since we moved from Vue to yttv.  No regrets.We supplement with Philo.  Mostly for my daughter.Yttv has improved tremendously with their vod, in fact I almost never see vod anymore, all dvr.  Cbs and NBC still do it but I don't watch generic cop or hospital dramas so I'm good.Vue is forcing vod on Fox and Sinclair stations.  So no relief there either."
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"Vue also has literally hundreds of local affiliates where DVR is blocked. I wouldn’t be able to record anything on CBS, ABC or Fox in my area. That‘s actually worse than YTTV in terms of being forced to watch VOD content. And it means we don’t even have the option of recording sports, news, talk or syndicated programming on those stations—the only programming which can be timeshifted is first-run network shows which are loaded to VOD.  Want to view local news, Jeopardy or a Seinfeld return later in the evening? Impossible. Miss the start of The Good Place by 15 minutes? Too bad...have to wait until the next morning when VOD is available. "

YouTube TV has BTN on their base plan for $40 a month so I tried it out for a week.  Wife loved it.  I loved it.  I  like they have 60 fps on all channels.  I'm saving $10 a month over PSVue which I like.  And I like the channel guide better and so does my wife.  Now if they get 5.1 audio on the channels that transmit 5.1, that would make me stay with YouTube TV forever.  Well at least until college football and basketball stop again."
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"I totally agree with everything you said.  I believe it was about January we were shopping for a TV service since we were dumping cable.  We tried Sling, Vue, Direct TV Now, Youtube TV, and Hulu Live.  Sling was ok, Hulu Live about made me throw the remote out a window because of the buffering, Vue was expensive and the interface was bleh, Direct TV wasn't horrible.  Then we tried Youtube TV and I haven't left since.  I was even happier to be grandfathered in at 35 dollars a month and have NBA TV and MLB TV added.  I think anyone can sit there and say with any service ""I wish I had (Insert Channel).  But all in all, this service is flat out excellent.  We do not miss cable at all and I get to watch everything I want to watch.  Sure I don't have red zone or NFL Network, but this season most of the thursday games can be viewed on another channel, and red zone was just a one day a week luxury.  I agree with you that Youtube TV is an amazing service that will only get better and for myself and my wife, I would highly recommend it to anyone!"
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,I've never experienced those problems with Vue.  What's your internet speed and how many people in your house?
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,I have fiber (1GB up/down). Only ever happens on local channels. 
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,Doesn't YTTV have fewer channels?
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"It's not the number of channels that people look at.  If it were, no one would be leaving cable TV."
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,Maybe. But they had the channels I watch. 
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,I loved YTTVI switched to Vue only because of Redzone Channel. I plan on going back after football ends.
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"I switched to YTTV from DTVN a few months ago because DTVN decided to take away all my locals for some reason. Honestly, the only thing I miss from DTVN is the $5 HBO, other than that YTTV has been leaps and bounds ahead of DTVN and their buggy ass software. YTTV does have fewer channels but none of them really impact me a lot so I'm fine with it. "
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"I did the trial on PSVue and I had the same thoughts on the interface. It was really difficult to find content or switch between channels. It looked like they were using an existing PS VOD interface that was focused on particular shows or content for live TV, and it was not intuitive at all to find a live schedule. I was also using it on a Amazon FireTV Stick, which struggled to run it.YTTV is very easy to use, and it's very easy to find content, especially using a Roku. If I had one suggestion to improve YTTV, it would be to allow a way to change back to the last channel watched. On college football Saturdays, it's nice to be able to switch between two games quickly. "
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,">If I had one suggestion to improve YTTV, it would be to allow a way to change back to the last channel watched.YES! It's the one thing, feature-wise, that YTTV is missing.&#x200B;EDIT- one other thing I wish YTTV would get ASAP is 5.1 audio support!"
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,Yttv has most of the channels I personally want(sports) and the channels the lady and kids watch(surprisingly decent amount of kids channels) and the ui/UX is a pleasure to use. Also don’t need Hulu when we have unlimited dvr.Wish I could’ve got the $35 deal but Comcast didn’t hook up the internet only package until I threatened to leave and by the price jumped up to $40.YouTube tv is rock solid
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,YTTV is my favorite OTA service. I’ve tried out pretty much every service. 
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"Agreed! I’ve tried Sling, Vue and now YouTube TV. YouTube offers the best overall experience. "
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"The ""rewinding"" of Vue happens to me sometimes.  It is when it initially grabs the lower bitrate stream then switches to higher bitrate.  I can visibly see the change in quality.  Unfortunately this sometimes means you go back in time a bit."
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"Re: your comment about Vue's interface... I disagree. Vue's interface is my personal favorite. Each section is labeled properly and you don't have to dig in sub-menu after sub-menu to get to the content you want. My 80yr old grandfather, who is extremely green when it comes to technology, uses Vue without any issue; it's the best for him because the channel and show tiles are large and easy for him to navigate. YTTV's main nav is simplified with 3 sections but each of those have sub-sections that go at least 2-3 levels deeper. I'm not implying that it's difficult to navigate YTTV, but it's not as easy to use as Vue is. And Vue offers the same personalized DVR library for up to 10 individual profiles. What I don't like about YTTV's ""profiles"" is that it requires each to signup with a Google/Gmail account if one doesn't already exist. It's not as simple as adding a person's name and date of birth on Vue. We've tried all of the streaming services at one point or another and every time, we come back to Vue. It has all of the channels we want and we've never had any problems with it since signing up over 2 years ago. If for some reason we didn't use Vue, YTTV would probably be our next option, though we'd use it begrudgingly."
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,Me: Are you liking YouTube TV?Girlfriend: YES! I can actually use this one. Sold. 
Initials Thoughts after Moving from Playstation Vue to YouTube TV,"New to PS Vue myself, and wow, the menu is very clunky, and my technology-challenged wife is annoyed.    It has the channels she wants (locals, HGTV, and the ones that show Law & Order) and the channels I want (all the ESPN's, Redzone, and Longhorn Network), just wish everything was easier to navigate.&#x200B;Also I've found that when you DVR 1 Premier league soccer match, you end up with like 10 to watch, and the one I wanted to watch from Saturday morning wasn't available to watch until Monday evening, but all the others were available, and I don't understand why.&#x200B;Otherwise, it's pretty cool, and for course it's like $70 less than we were paying, so I'm ok with some awkward menus.  But basically, if it wasn't for Longhorn Network, I'd probably be looking at moving to another service."
"Stopped receiving NBC, CW (22 etc channels) can't get it back.",edit - Never mind. I see they come in sometimes so it can't be the frequency changes. I lost CW and PBS about 2 years ago because the tower was damaged in a storm. After repairs were complete I never got them back. I hope you find a solution. 
"Stopped receiving NBC, CW (22 etc channels) can't get it back.","There tends to be more interference at VHF and NBC is in that band. So you might try turning off all your electronics, including LED and CFL lights, to check. Getting the neighbours to to help with the check by turning off their stuff might be harder."
"Stopped receiving NBC, CW (22 etc channels) can't get it back.","Most amplified antennas don't work at all if the amplifier is unplugged. In some you can bypass it and use the antenna passively. I don't know about the Clearstream.But assuming it's like most, the amp could be shot (electronics can fail), the power plug or transformer (if it has one) may be shot. The coax may have developed a short or break. The outlet itself could be off. Apart from something like that seems unlikely to lose all channels suddenly."
"Stopped receiving NBC, CW (22 etc channels) can't get it back.","I'm sorry if my post was misleading i forgot to add.  I still get abc, fox,  etc...  just not nbc"

Getting the most out of my gigabit internet?,"As others have mentioned, get your own equipment (separate modem and router) and you'll be much happier.But just FYI, I'm hoping you didn't let them upsell you on gigabit as a result of prior poor streaming performance. The vast majority of people do not need anything close to gig speeds. Look around here and you'll find plenty of folks who are able to do multiple 4K streams with a fraction of that speed (Netflix says you only need 25 Mbps per stream). Comcast and the other ISPs try to convince you that they need gig to stream. You don't. What you DO need is better equipment than they rent to you. But of course, they're not going to give you equipment that performs well, because then you'd never upgrade to gig. It's a racket.Get some better gear and then look into whether you can downgrade your speed. Good luck!"

Looking for advice on starting cord cutting,"Of those three I'd keep the Roku, it's the most universal/agnostic. I personally prefer the SHIELD TV boxes, but the Rokus are good too and of the three you listed that would be my choice.For a first timer, you might want to start with the major services, Netflix and Hulu, and for streaming TV, either DTVNow, PSVue, or SlingTV. Or maybe Hulu Live TV if you're looking to consolidate everything into a single app."

Antenna troubles,"WPIX is a VHF (RF # < 14) station.  The Amazon antenna is a leaf style antenna and they are not good at picking up VHF.  I'm not sure why you can't WNYW but I suspect that it's your antenna/amp that is causing the problem. You might try to return it and get something like a Winegard Freevision FV-30BB.  It's much better than any leaf antenna, and it handles VHF too. "
Antenna troubles,Are you using it with the amp? If so you should try it without as you are super close to some of the board cast stations. To be honest a paper clip might work for you with that report.
Antenna troubles,"Yeah I am I’ll try without the amp, is there any disadvantage that the amp gives?"
Antenna troubles,"Two things:1. How are you ""aiming"" your flat antenna? Is it edge-on directly to the south-south-west? (214 - 217 degrees you say). Or is its flat side pointed that direction? Dipole antennas receive a figure-of-eight shape perpendicular to the flat surface. Aiming doesn't have to be perfect, BUT if it is ""edge-on"" to 225 degrees then that is near *exactly wrong* :-)2. What is on the other side of the wall you are using? Dipoles hung on walls are very sensitive to whatever is on the other side! Mine was critical to vertical placement. I installed it where it seemed visually best - just above my TV screen at 84"" above the floor; I got *very, very poor results*. Left or right changes of several feet made no difference. However, moving it upward less than 6 inches was dramatically better - reception of 88 channels!Turns out the other side of my bedroom wall was tiled up to 84 inches. Tiled walls typically have steel mesh embedded which can dramatically affect an antenna on the other side. I suspect that a plumbing chase within the walls would do very much the same thing.Best of luck!+"
Antenna troubles,"1) It's flat side is pointed to around 225 I believe.2) The other side of the wall is a hallway in the apartment, the other side of the wall on the one near my TV (the initial placement) is the living room specifically probably the wall mounted TV.

Comcast had revenue in the $84B range in 2017, they didn't get they way because they are stupid. The company started diversifying years ago. Comcast already has fiber to every single neighborhood in its footprint. They already have commercial power to their cable plant in every single neighborhood.

Cable companies' heads are still in the sand,"I've had 5G for 2 years now with a provider that operates their own network here in my state. It's LOS and I use a RocketDish RD-5G34. The broadcast tower is just over a mile away. I can easily get 200mbps on a good day, and with latency to most US servers being in the low 40s.It can't be beat in rural areas where there is no cable. &#x200B;"
Cable companies' heads are still in the sand,"That's not 5G, as in 5th generation wireless, that's 5ghz, using a point to point network.The LOS requirement is the real killer of that technology in most markets."
Cable companies' heads are still in the sand,Everyone already has more than enough speed...5G is pure excess and anyone getting excited about increased internet speeds in 2018 probably needs to get outside more and find more meaningful hobbies. 
Cable companies' heads are still in the sand,Except for all the people who are stuck in towns where the local cable monopoly has control. Anything that's another route to access decent internet will be a great help to them.
Cable companies' heads are still in the sand,"Speed ins't the issue for most people, it's the cost per gigabyte that limits how useful mobile data is."
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,"Im on my Roku watching YouTube TV right now.  Edit: Did a little research and found nothing. I would think Roku dropping YTTV would be all over the realm of cordcutting news. What kind of Roku are you using, that might affect whether or not YTTV can be installed. Also, have you updated your Roku recently?"
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,I would think this would be major news...that’s why I started here... the devices are all new. I have a 4K ultra that I purchased just for YTTV and the other 2 are sharp TVs w/ built in Roku that I literally setup last night.... then this morning all 3 dropped the app within mins... I contacted Roku and they have no idea... no known issues. 
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,Can you be on YouTubeTV with 1.5 mpbs service?
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,"Yes... it’s actually one of the few services that works... the quality is very reduced most of the time, but 90% of the time it works with limited buffering. "
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,I don’t have a Roku but is it possible that you have an older model that YTTV has dropped support for?
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,I purchased the latest ultra 4K version just for YouTube TV... and I purchased 2 new Sharp TVs with Roku built in... yesterday. Set them up last night... all 3 dropped the app this morning.. 
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,Still available for me. Try [reinstalling it](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/195316/youtube-tv).
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,I will when I’m back home.. reinstalled on 2 devices this morning... both dropped again... frustrating... 
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,Roku Ultra and TCL Roku TV (which is basically an Ultra). Both have it available to install.
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,"That not my issue... YTTV is in the store available to install, but once I complete the install, the app never appears on the home screen or it disappears after a few minutes."
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,🤔
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,Is it possible YTTV is no longer available in your area?  Can check availability [HERE](https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/7068923?hl=en).  Unsure if there's a correlation to Roku preventing the channel based on your location?  Something to check at least...
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,"It looks like major cities are listed... so it’s hard to tell if my area is included .. either way it still works on my phones/tablets... and I can cast it with no issue. I can now cast it and once it’s playing, I can choose other shows in YTTV with the Roku remote... but if I press Home, the YTTV app is not listed. "
Roku dropped YouTube TV?,"This happened to me last week. The app was there in the morning, then gone mid-day. By evening the app was back without any intervention on my part. It was strange, but temporary. "
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,"The cablecard is used to get traditional cable tv service with the HD Homerun. You buy service from your local cable provider and use the HD Homerun instead of their cable boxes. You’ll have to pay for their normal programming package and most charge a nominal monthly fee for the cablecard ($2-5 per month.)If you want a streaming alternative, Silicon Dust has their own streaming plan for $35 per month which includes ESPN, Discovery, FX, etc. It’s a decent entry level plan but is missing many niche channels if you have specific interests. No Regional Sports Stations, no NBA/MLB/NFL, has FX but not FXX or FXMovies, etc. There are certainly advantages to local storage of recordings. However as a fellow YTTV user, one thing I didn’t like about this was the loss of the VOD library. YTTV and other streaming services blend that content pretty seamlessly. If you start recording a show with Episode 4, YTTV typically pulls the prior VOD episodes into your library. With a DVR solution like this, you only get what you record. Remote access of recordings can also be an issue. You need to configure your home network / internet to allow remote access. Your internet upload speed could be a bottleneck. With YTTV, the entire cloud DVR library is easily accessible on any device with Internet access."
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,"Good point, I didn't even think about the YTTV VOD. My wife and I were just considering The HDHR since there are channels that are still missing on YTTV that we would like to get back. And we have tried all the tv streaming services from PS Vue, to Sling."
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,"Who is your provider?  That will largely determine whether you can use other DVR systems or if Windows Media Center (running in Windows 7 or 8) is your only choice.  For example, in former Time Warner Cable areas (now Charter Spectrum), most everything is copy-once, so it has DRM and only WMC can record it.  But as wy1d0 noted, if you're with Comcast, then only the premiums are copy-once, so you can use any DVR software if you only want non-premium channels."
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,RCN
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,"I'm using HD Homerun Prime with a cable card supplied by Comcast. FCC requires this be free so I actually get a $2.50 credit on my bill for ""customer owned equipment"" in addition to not paying any DVR, HD Technology or rental fees.I use this in conjunction with Channels DVR app which gives DVR and guide functionality as well as commercial skip like Tivo. This setup is the best experience I've found so far but the Android TV app still needs a few more tweaks to be perfect. I've emailed with the dev and they seem open to adding my suggested enhancements.One thing is that premium channels like HBO are marked as DRM and can't be opened by some of the 3rd party apps that go with HD Homerun but I'm going to drop it from my Comcast and just get HBO separately via Amazon Channels."
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,I also use the hdhomerun prime  but my provider is spectrum.  The DRM channels are the only negative for me.  Some logins work with android tv though so I can usually watch shows from premiums through the actual apps.  
Has anyone used a HDHomeRun with a CableCARD? How is the experience? and where did you get your Card?,I used that CableCard/Comcast/HDHR combo for years and loved it.

Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,Start by lowering the price of a rental. It is way more expensive than popping around the corner to pick up a movie at the kiosk. 
Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,"ya, that doesn't make any sense . how can streaming be twice as expensive as moving around DVDs?"
Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,"It’s competitive with PPV, Google Play, and all other streaming movie rental sites/companies. You are paying for convenience. You don’t have any concern whether the title is available at your favorite kiosk rental location and don’t have to return the disk when you are done with it.  That’s why they charge what they do. "
Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,"Part of the problem is that it was a pain in the ass to try and rent a movie. If I remember correctly you had to go to their website, rent the movie, then go watch it in the app. Too much work, especially when iTunes allows me to rent the same movie without the extra steps. "

Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,IDK how much of a place VOD has on today's market. AFAIK the vast majority of people want to set it and forget it when it comes to digital streaming. Pay 10-15 bucks a month and be given an assortment of stuff to watch.
Redbox hires Dell executive to grow VOD business,"Rentals are going to be a tuff nut.  I've got probably half a dozen RB kiosks within  a mile or so of my home.  One just outside of a CVS on my way to work, leave a couple minutes early, drop by and pick up.  Next AM, drop by and return.  I can understand the convienence factor of not having to stop by a kiosk if it's not on your way, but it literally just takes me a minute.  Also, my library is on the way to Walmart.  Check new releases online and if the library has it have them put it on the hold shelf, it's free to me.  Once again, minute in and minute out.  I've never rented from a VOD service.  Five bucks vs two buck or free.....it's like paying myself to get it.&#x200B;"

"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals",[deleted]
"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals",PBS is complicated but we have seen reports that PBS is looking into getting more streaming rights for their content; maybe launching their PBS Kids channel on streaming services first because they already stream that channel online and have all the streaming rights. Getting local feeds of all the local PBS stations will be hard due to all the different ownership groups. 
"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals","Yeah, as k6usy said, PBS has a lot of rights complications to sift through still, so they've been unable to make their channels available via streaming yet. They're hoping to get the situation sorted by next year."
"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals",About time.  It wasnt right raising the price on the people without locals and then they still didnt have locals.  It was part of my reason for dropping PSVue and taking a break from pay TV.  Now I have YouTube TV and have all locals plus CW and love it.  Plus it's cheaper.  
"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals","Same here. I feel almost jaded that Vue is adding locals after I’ve already made the switch, but YTTV’s cheaper rates + smoother interface is a big win."
"PlayStation Vue is Re-Adding Sinclair Owned ABC, CBS, FOX, & NBC Locals",Until the next contract dispute...

Roku vs Smart TV,"The Roku is easier to upgrade, your TV not so much. "
Roku vs Smart TV,"TVs are really easy to upgrade, just get a Roku :)"
Roku vs Smart TV,"Most smart tv software feels like abandonware to me. It seems like once the tv is sold, nothing really happens with it. Sporadic upgrades with not much additional added when they do happen. Roku is in the business of making streaming devices, so they have a vested interest in improving it and keeping it up to date. (they only license to tv manufacturers). Also, being external means you can switch, to an apple tv, chromecast, firetv, etc...Basically, I just ignore the smarts in my tv and use my roku."
Roku vs Smart TV,"In that vein, I have a samsung smart blu-ray player. I plugged it into the network on a lark. It updated and most of the ""apps"" disappeared. I'm certainly not impressed. It basically has Netflix and that's it.I unplugged it from the network and it hasn't been plugged in since."
Roku vs Smart TV,Much faster than a smart TV. More apps also
Roku vs Smart TV,I've got a TCL Roku TV. One of my favorite things that it does is it takes the local antenna TV feed and converts it to a TV channel guide showing a traditional grid of what is on and what is coming up. If you attach a memory stick you can also pause live TV for up to an hour. The best of both worlds.
Roku vs Smart TV,"Same here and the OTA channel guide is also seen on PlutoTV, at least the primary channels.  AFAIK you can disable built-in Roku functionality and use something separate if something better comes along.   "
Roku vs Smart TV,I love my Roku enabled TVs. Kinda the best of both worlds.
Roku vs Smart TV,"Me too. But, I bought a Roku Ultra for a dumb TV and the experience is so much faster and smoother. Plus the headphone jack on the remote is nice."
Roku vs Smart TV,"Personally, i'd keep a TV for 6+ years but the Roku I view like a computer, and i'd rather upgrade that every 2-3 years.  The stand alone Roku is also a lot more powerful than anything they'd put inside of a TV anyway.  It's surprising what kind of a difference it makes."
Roku vs Smart TV,Unless you get a 4K Roku TV. Those have performance similar to a Roku Ultra.
Roku vs Smart TV,"The Smart TVs (I'm not talking about Roku TVs) generally have the following problems and shortcomings:1) much fewer apps and channels to choose from2) often much clunkier navigation with remote3) almost always a more clumsy layout/interface4) and worst, the apps are less frequently updated, and tend to become more abandoned over time.A Roku (or most of the streaming devices) are a much better option."
Roku vs Smart TV,5. Samsung TVs (and probably others) are used to spy on you
Roku vs Smart TV,"I purchased an LG TV with built in GoogleTV years back, it was phenomenal until LG abandoned the platform for their own OS and then google rolled out AndroidTV abandoning the LG TV’s.  I’ve got a Roku hooked up to it now and love it.  My next TV will more than likely be a TV with built in Roku"
Roku vs Smart TV,"Let’s say you run Netflix. You come up with a great new feature and want to incorporate into your app. You quickly spend the money to upgrade your app on Roku, Apple and Amazon. Then maybe PS4 and android. The app for XYZ brand tv? It’s maybe 0.5% of your user base. There may be no easy upgrade system. That app you may not have even been made by you and it is up to XYZ to code the upgrade and send to the TV. The service upgrades may eventually make the old smart TVs incapable of playing your content. Other than Roku TVs you are never sure you will have an app available if you want to try a new service. Say your library offers Hoopla it isn’t a common smart tv app. "
Roku vs Smart TV,Easier to use - faster - and easy to update once they start to slow down / stop working well.  
Roku vs Smart TV,"I swore by my Roku2 for my FHD Samsung. It turned the tv into a smart tv, easy user interface, great remote, love it! I still love the Roku, but I recently purchased an 8000 series QLED Samsung, and at least over the roku2, I much prefer the TV's apps. The Samsung app store has our essentials, Netflix, Sling, HBO, Showtime."
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,"With the older version of this [antenna](https://www.antennasdirect.com/store/mobile.php?cat=26&productid=225) and this [Preamplifier](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DQN3R9O/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_B4dSBbPKTJE25) I get NYC channels most days and mid-NJ and Albany sometimes. NYC is 90 miles from my house in CT. The further afield channels are 100+ miles. And it's not even mounted outdoors. It's in my attic at slightly above sea level elevation. I also run a filter for FM frequencies.YMMV of course, but that's my experience with it. Not sure if the new version is better or worse than the older one I have. Haven't had a need to try it.Good luck!"
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,Which FM filter do you use? Do you use that same antenna for FM and TV channels?
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,"TV Fool indicates you have some terrain in the way.  If you are having problems with reception some additional height might help.  I would suggest a VHF/UHF yagi if the stations you want to watch are on both bands.  If you are interested in UHF only you can use a UHF monoband yagi, or a UHF bowtie with a reflector.    Both Winegard and Channel Master are good websites to look at."
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,I'm looking for a decent one as well but don't want to spend over $50. Any suggestions would help. :) 
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,I can’t find anyone in the area to mount antenna outside. Anyone have suggestions on who they have used to do this? 
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,"Range ratings on antennas, particularly those intended for indoor use, don't really mean anything. It probably isn't worth thinking about. Just get some cheap rabbit ears from a local discount store and try it.TV Fool is somewhat negative on the idea of indoor TV reception. Is  roof or attic antenna a possibility?"
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,"[This is a monster](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MZ20Z2Z/) but it works really well for me... i can pull more then i though i could, and we have very similar TV Fool reports.. if you go outside make sure to get a surge protector www.amazon.com/dp/B0016AIYU6/ (in line link didn't work) This is great since your signals are from all over... mount it as high as you can and try with and without the amplifier to see what works best fro you."
Recommendations on a 70+ mile HD antenna?,I got an “Amazon’s pick” one for under $30.... I think the brand is “u must have” it has a stated range of 65-80 miles.... its awesome.

Connecting Roku TV to ethernet?,"What do they specifically consider a ""large"" device? Sounds like maybe the WiFi network requires a browser to log on. That'd make sense, I guess.Either way, see here: https://forums.roku.com/viewtopic.php?t=92119"
Connecting Roku TV to ethernet?,"If your Roku TV didn't come with an ethernet port, then you'll have to get some kind of Wifi router to plug into the ethernet and connect the Roku TV to that.There are mixed reports of using USB-Ethernet adapters, but there's no easy way to know which ones are compatible as even different Roku TV models seem to have different results.

YouTube TV over FiOS,Have you tried hardwiring to rule out WiFi issues? That'd be the easiest way to start troubleshooting.
YouTube TV over FiOS,Not yet. It’s intermittent. 
YouTube TV over FiOS,"We use YouTube tv over fios, WiFi on an Apple TV and it works perfectly. I had jitter on live tv in fios when I still used them for actual tv. Turns out it was the fiber optic cable that was kinked in one part. Try checking the fiber optic cable that goes into your fios box and make sure there are no kinks in it. "
YouTube TV over FiOS,No issues with YTTV and FiOS wired one Ethernet.
YouTube TV over FiOS,"What are you using to watch it? I never had problems with either my iPad or Win 10 laptop, but my Xbox One was a POS with YouTube tv. I've switched to Hulu Live and its been much better. There are still times when the video quality goes downhill, but its no where near as bad as YouTube tv was. "
YouTube TV over FiOS,LG Electronics 49LJ550M 49-Inch Class Full HD 1080p Smart LED TV (2018 Model)
YouTube TV over FiOS,I’ve had issues with it on one of my Rokus but it’s only the little cheap / crappy $40 one. My Roku 4 doesn’t have problems. Usually when I change it to 720p or 480p it fixes it. I think the WiFi reception is bad in that room as well. 
YouTube TV over FiOS,"No issues here.  We were using YTTV on a generation 1 Chromecast with some stuttering issues.  But after switching to a wired XBox One S, it works great.  Looks like I need to upgrade my Chromecast.  "
YouTube TV over FiOS,"Yeah, 1st Gen Chromecast really struggles with YTTV. It takes forever to load something, and will often have stuttering and framerate issues. Newer ones work just fine. "
YouTube TV over FiOS,Suggestions:- Try hardwiring- Try changing some settings on your TV that might be trying to smooth framerates.- Try using a chromecast or roku instead.
YouTube TV over FiOS,One's live tv streaming experience can vary by device and internet. This is why I prefer to use an Apple TV 4K via ethernet. YouTube TV is a great choice. 
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","If that $65 is internet only, then expect to keep that price for a while as thats the standard price for their internet service across their service area, I think Ive had that price for 3 years now with no contract or specials on my account.Of course, They could roll out a new standard price at any time but expect it to be a little higher than $65 if it were to happen."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","But, Internet Only used to only cost $40 a month and the technology that powers the internet gets cheaper every year. So, why has the price almost doubled in the last ten years? Shouldn't the price be going down? Shouldn't loyal customers be getting a discount not jacked up rates? Smells like bullshit."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","65 in my area too, but called and got 10 off a month promo for 12 months."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","The first thing you do is find out who your elected representatives are in your town government - city council or board of aldermen or whatever they call it. Tell them - by letter or email - that you voting for them instead of their election opponent is contingent on their not voting to renew the monopoly when it expires. Tell them that you're not saying they should kick spectrum out and give the monopoly to anyone else, just that they should no longer grant a monopoly. Then find out all the competitors who could conceivably come in and line up some who say they would be interested in coming in as a competitor if the monopoly ended, and put them in touch with your elected people. Then do the same thing with the mayor, the head of your local utilities commission,etc. Not only is it easier if you are making the argument ""I don't want to kick them out, just end the monopoly and allow free market competition"" than saying ""kick them out"", in the end it is a benefit, because creating competition in the local cable market can lead to reduced prices and more services.I'm not talking out my ass, my town did this and now our cable rates are 30% lower than neighboring towns and the cable companies offer us phone as well as cable and internet, which they don't offer all of to neighboring towns. And we have choice of like 5 different ISP solutions. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","This is what happened in my city, and so the local electric company rolled out their own fiber solution. I get 250 Mbps down/up for $45 a month, and I don’t have to ever deal with the company “accidentally” making billing errors or charging me bullshit fees.All because my city got fed up with being hostage to Spectrum/Charter and voted for people who would take steps to fix it. Just ran a speedtest from my phone and I am getting 146 down/ 140 up actual over wifi. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","thanks, seems like a lot of work, but at the end, it's definitely the right thing to do. after all, this is what our elected reps are there for... need to put them to work lol "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","if you are stuck with spectrum alone, the trick is to keep rolling over to a new account holder every year to qualify for new sub pricing.  so pass your account to any adult in your household and your golden.  i just passed my account to my daughter, and we got the same low rate back, and they even gave us their latest modem and wifi router which is far superior to the old crap from a year ago."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","This is exactly what I did. New customers get promo price but loyal customers who have never had a late payment get rewarded with an increased price. Also, new customer is considered new person at an existing address or  3 months without an account for previous customers."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",How to you roll over to a new account holder? Do you have to cancel your service first? 
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",I canceled Spectrum TV and was able to keep my grandfathered internet only rate of $41.99 (my apartment building has a bulk deal; I'm in NYC) though it took me 4 phone calls to get a rep who agreed to it.  I currently have Youtube TV and it has more channels than I can watch.  I don't even have Netflix or Hulu anymore.  I do get Fandor which has some classic films but don't pay for much else.

I pay for 50mbps and rarely get over 5mbps, with it often being so bad I can't even stream Netflix. And with the monopolies they have, there's absolutely nothing you can do about it. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",You have cabling problem or a modem that is on its way out. You should have them come out and test your line. 
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",Same thing happened here.  I was on a 40 dollar promo price and after the year it went up to 65 bucks.  I have always been able to ask them for the promo price but not anymore.    I feel like they are more strict on the price so I've had it at 65 dollars now the last 2 years I believe.
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","This is sadly accurate.Spectrum now plays hardball on pricing, I’ve heard that some people have been able to call and negotiate after they’ve been off promo for 90days, but it’s like whispers and rumors. “I heard that my friend at work called and they said...” In my area it’s kind of insane, because they compete with another ISP and tv provider and they’re more than happy to deal if you play hardball."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",What speed? 
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","""up to 100 MPBS""  but I don't even need that speed!! I asked if they can downgrade my speed so I can pay less, maybe to like 30-40, which is still super fast, and they said NO.  But I figured out what I'm gonna do. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","Howdy neighbor!! Camping out in the comments for suggestions because I get absolutely shit service for that price. Sloooooow connection, not great when you work from home some days. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","I'd recommend closing your account, and then reopening an account under a new name. Assuming you don't live by yourself that is, if you do all I can recommend is calling and trying to get a better price but that may not work as I know Spectrum is a pain."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","That's kind of what I'm gonna do! except I don't need to change my name. I'm gonna cancel, and after 1 month, I'm considered a new customer, and eligible for the 39.99 promo. boom problem solved. "
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates!

If you want ANY shot at all you have to be speaking with customer retention, the regular people aren’t going to do anything for you. Even then, there’s a good chance you won’t get anything. I mentioned this somewhere else but I’ve heard a rumor that if you’re off promo for 3 months they’re open to working with you."
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","I am assuming $39.99 is a promo price?  The best way to stretch this is to use the promo for the 12 month duration. At the beginning of the 13th month, cancel the service, wait a few days and then have a roommate sign up for a new 12 month promo.I do this every year. It is a minor PITA, but when you think how much money you save for those few days without service, in my opinion, it is usually worth it!"
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",They are NOT raising your rates. You were on a promo that ended. You are now paying the standard rate.

"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","I forget what billing software Spectrum uses. I was trained on CSG. Discounts should still apply, but I wouldn't know which departments get access to them. If you complain enough to the right people they can reset your discount/promotional prices. We had a slough of discounts we could apply to accounts when I was dispatching at Grande. Complain, complain, and complain until you eventually get what you want. There's someone within the bowels of Spectrum that can add a 12-month discount to your account for the entry-level promotional price."

"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates!

Check https://www.verizonwireless.com/5g/home/ to see if it is yet available in your zip code.First 3 months are free, then $50/month for Verizon customers, $70/month for everyone else. Might be worth investigating. Maybe you could sign up for Verizon for the 3 free months, cancel, and then go back to Spectrum and get new customer pricing again for a year."

"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","Your promo probably rolled off, which is why you keep getting your price raised.

"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",When you signed up you knew it was a promo. They didn't raise your rate. They took away your discount because you aren't new anymore right? Every bill showed the price and the discount and or said promo.You either cancel and have another adult sign up or you use your phone only for a month or so and sign back up yourself or move. Cable companies have been monopolizing for decades. Nothing new here. 
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???",It looks like AT&T covers that zip code 99% with DSL.  Why is that not an option?
"Spectrum has a monopoly in my area, keeps raising my rates! Options???","Call and ask to talk to someone to cancel your service. Then, be friendly but stern about how you love the service but you can’t afford the raising rates. Usually they will give you a promo plan for a year with a discount. I’ve had anywhere from $10-15 off the last few years. Put a reminder in your calendar for one year from the date and write down all the details in case they try to screw you again in 3 months.."

CBS All-Access NFL Replays?,"No, it has no DVR. TV show episodes are on demand but live stuff like local news, sports, and local shows such as those by an affiliate are only live.Consider PS Vue,  Hulu with Live TV, YouTube TV or Fubotv if they have your local affiliate. These have dvrs. Gamepass is another option as it strictly replays except for either pre or post season games. Sign up to get emails as you may get a discount offer."
CBS All-Access NFL Replays?,Damn ok thank you. I was hoping to avoid the others as CBS is so much cheaper and those games are the only television I can't already get. It is what it is though. 
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),See below thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/slingtv/comments/9jhva8/some_lifestyle_news_and_childrens_channels_were/
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"Hmm I already had all those, i think they just combined the orange and blue levels? Do you still have ESPN?Edit: Free preview till 10/18"
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"They took whatever package you currently owned, and added 4 bundles:  Kids Extra, Lifestyle Plus Extra, Comedy Plus Extra and News Extra "
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"For me, 95% of those channels are part of the reason I cut cable... paying for a whole bunch of stuff I never watched. At least Sling breaks it out into better packages than cable though. I'm sure some people like them. For anyone new to Sling, there are free previews of some extra channels (HBO, Starz, Showtime, sports, etc.) about once a month. They usually only last the weekend but once in a great while they run a bit longer like this promo. It's great because if you have the DVR service, you can record the few movies you might be interested in and then watch them later. Still haven't watched Downsizing from when I recorded it a couple weeks ago during an Epix preview."
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"Do they announce the previews or do you have to just stumble upon them yourself (I don't have Sling, so I don't know if you CAN even 'stumble' upon them yourself like you could if you just had cable connected to your TV)."
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"Yes.  If cable offered a ""Locals Only"" package for $20, and then let me add 4-5 channel bundles like Sling, I'd still have cable.  My bill would only be $30 (locals + TCM/Hollywood pack + Syfy/fantasy pack).  **Dish Satellite** offers a la carte.  Buy the basic ""welcome pack"" package for $20; add extra channels for $4/each.  If Dish can do it, digital cable can do it.- BTW those HBO, Showtime previews are also offered on cable & dish services.  Typically during holidays like Fathers Day, Memorial Day, Labor Day, etc.  It isn't a Sling-only deal but one offered nationwide.Some of these channels like Disney XD I've never seen, so I'm curious what they offer (supposedly aimed at boys' tastes).  For example, last night I got to see Pirates of the Caribbean 4 on the MTV2 channel."
SlingTV is adding Free channels (preview until Oct 17),"this is tempting. I know I shouldn't, but half price for all bundles. Damn."
HDHomeRun Sale,Thanks I bought one last week.  Where are you guys placing your antennas indoors?  
HDHomeRun Sale,"Where you want your antenna is going to depend on signal strength at your location.  I needed to put an antenna in my attic to pick up one station I need.  I simply can't pick it up with a normal indoor antenna.  In some locations, you might even need an outdoor antenna."
HDHomeRun Sale,Mine is in the window in my office. Thinking about getting an attic antenna  
HDHomeRun Sale,80' up on the roof of my coop  ota is worthless here in the hilly   part of queens ny without altitude.
HDHomeRun Sale,"So I just watched the product video for HDhomerun.  I’m confused about the monthly/annual fee.  Is there no DVR service unless we pay a fee, or how does this work?"
HDHomeRun Sale,"You buy their tuner (this), and then if you also want a DVR, you can pay for theirs, pay for plex pass, or setup something free like TVHeadend or MythTV.The Paid offerings do tend to have much better Program Guides. (Get what you pay for...) "
HDHomeRun Sale,Plex pass at $150 is lifetime DVR/guide for the price Tivo charges for 1 year of its service.  I really like it in combination with a HDHR.  Will also allow you to stream the TV and your media library over the internet as well as schedule recordings.
HDHomeRun Sale,I use NextPVR on Windows 10.  Bit of a pain to set up but works.
HDHomeRun Sale,Silicondust's DVR product requires a monthly fee.  It also requires you own one of their tuners.
HDHomeRun Sale,this is not worth itThe duo can not serve h.264 video it needs to be transcoded by the device that is playing it or it needs to go through a server.You are better off getting a $119 amazon  SiliconDust HDHR5-4US HDHomeRun Connect Quatro 4-Tuneror waiting for a better sale on the quatro which often goes to $95  Silicon Dust Refurbished Store  HDHomeRun CONNECT QUATRO (P/N: HDHR5-4US-R)  $98.88  &#x200B;
HDHomeRun Sale,I don't think either Connect will transcode. Are you thinking of the Extend?
HDHomeRun Sale,"I too would have preferred the quatro too, but its not the one on sale now. And Like /u/mhiggy said, the only one that does h.264 is the extend. Then again, if you are getting the package with plex pass and setting that up, it requires a server too, which can do h264. "
HDHomeRun Sale,"Um.... I'm not sure why people are upvoting you. You are clearly an idiot, You are recommending the 4 tuner version of the exact same model you are complaining about.Connect duo = 2Connect quadro = 4.Jebus, do people even pay attention to what people post or just upvote at random?!"
HDHomeRun Sale,"Could you set up a raspberry pi to do the transcoding?  Haven't looked into this, but if it could, that would make the cheaper Hdhomerun a lot more attractive."
HDHomeRun Sale,I use my phone to provide wifi at my house and I have 2 TVs with antennas.  Would this work for me or does the HDHomerun need a wired internet connection?  Both TVs also have Rokus.
HDHomeRun Sale,the HDHomerun needs a wired ethernet connection
HDHomeRun Sale,"Wired, yes, but it does not actually need an internet connection.If you want to get technical, you could get a router that can accept an incoming WiFi signal (your phone) as the incoming internet connection, and then redistributes it over both wireless and wired.  This would allow your TVs, Roku, and HDHR to exist all on the same network."
HDHomeRun Sale,"It does need a wired network connection. That said, you could also get some sort of [Wifi Bridge](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Wireless-Portable-Travel-Router/dp/B00TQEX8BO/ref=pd_bxgy_147_3?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00TQEX8BO&pd_rd_r=1f18572a-c357-11e8-a5cd-85f68c4eb870&pd_rd_w=daBr5&pd_rd_wg=NNtJ1&pf_rd_i=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_p=6725dbd6-9917-451d-beba-16af7874e407&pf_rd_r=0B0AGCTNXR09BKBAZD1F&pf_rd_s=desktop-dp-sims&pf_rd_t=40701&psc=1&refRID=0B0AGCTNXR09BKBAZD1F) and use that to connect back to the wifi. But unless you have some killer wireless, Streaming this will use a fair bit of bandwidth. "
HDHomeRun Sale,No on basically every level.
HDHomeRun Sale,Thanks for posting! I’ve been wanting to try this out. Looking to replace my Tablo.
HDHomeRun Sale,"A better option would be price matching the Quatro at Best Buy, with the one at BHPhotoVideo.  $120, and much better than the Duo.  "
HDHomeRun Sale,"Does anyone know if the CSPAN option on here is actually the live CSPAN feed, or just the podcast feed?  That's been the main thing that I really miss from having cable. "
HDHomeRun Sale,Can someone explain to me what the Hdhomerun is ?
HDHomeRun Sale,"It's a device that lets you record TV. They have models you hook up to an antenna with two or four tuners, and another that takes a cablecard if you have Cable. You can then use something like Plex to record and store it."
HDHomeRun Sale,The Fire TV 3 (pendant) supports MPEG2 and plays hdhomerun perfectly. Also with 2gb RAM THE Fire TV 3 can pause live TV with the hdhomerun app for up to 90 minutes.
HDHomeRun Sale,"If you have an Apple TV, you could look not channels. I’d go for the Quattro, 2 tuners is simply not enough! I have a 2 tuner hooked up with plex dvr, and I find myself using Tablo to watch shows I can’t record with the hd homerun into plex. I also have a 4 tuner Tablo that records to a hd. I wish Tablo would partner with plex like hd homerun did!"
HDHomeRun Sale,"I got a Quatro from Best Buy for $99 two months ago, all the jeopardy you can watch"
HDHomeRun Sale,That's $10 cheaper than the Duo itself and the Plex Pass offer is worth $30 at the monthly rate. For anyone wondering.
HDHomeRun Sale,"I ordered an HDHomeRun a few months ago, and then called Comcast to get a cable card for it...and they said it would be $15 per month for the ""additional outlet"" fee.  so I cancelled the whole thing."
HDHomeRun Sale,"is it free?  oh, it isn't?  PASS."

TiVo Bolt OTA 4-tuner cuts DVR monthly from $15 to $7,"ota isn't like cellular or wifi - you wouldn't want the ota tuner/dvr as your antenna    as the vhf:uhf waves are too wide which would have to make the device too large.  in addition ota vhf:uhf works best when it's at least a yard away from other devices,  so the tuner/dvr circuitry would end up interfering with your idea of a built in aerial."

If you add a third television then 4 tuners may not be enough if everyone's watching something at the same time.We have a 4 Tuner HD Homerun because we're using it with multiple televisions and we frequently max out all 4 tuners. There are a TON more over-the-air channels now days than just ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, FOX. This is something we didn't even realize until we cut the cord and set up a good roof top antenna.

"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Over the last \~5 years, we have always had the worst streaming problems with Hulu. Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, and tens of other services have almost always worked perfectly fine. But across 3 or 4 devices we have consistently had trouble with Hulu buffering, not loading streams, pausing, etc. I don't know what it is but it's really frustrated. I actually just tried to cancel them two weeks ago becasue we started getting problems again but they couldn't because wee were being billed through Spotify. Didn't make sense to then do it because were getting it for I think $3 right now. It seems to have fixed itself once again this week.We were told to delete the app, restart the player and reinstall it again. Supposedly a full cache can cause some streaming errors. Although, if you just started using it, I doubt that's the cause."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","When I had Hulu live it would typically glitch out a few times per episode of whatever.    Got fed up after a week or so and switched to YouTube tv.    Have gigabit fiber, it was not on my end."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","If it was Hulu Live I'd say yes. Regular sstreaming, no."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","May be the native app on your Samsung.  Do you have the same issue on your phone or PC?  Do you have any other streaming device you can try on (Roku, Firestick, Chromecast)?I had similar issues on my smart tv's native app with Hulu and finally broke down and got a Roku 4k.  No issues ever since."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Are you using WiFi? Hulu has the worst servers, I had the same issue with only Hulu despite perfect streaming from Netflix and AmazonThe only thing that fixed it was using a wired Ethernet connection"
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","I've never had this issue.You need to eliminate problems before jumping to a conclusion, however.It could be any number of things...things within your control and things beyond your control. It may be your modem, router, TV...or it may be that something was down in an exchange elsewhere. Or your ISP hates Hulu for not giving them enough cash and is throttling them. I'd try it several times during your trial before making a judgment."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",Oh I definitely will give it a chance. I've got mobile devices and several roku's I can try as well.
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Don't listen to folks blaming your internet Hulu streaming plain sucks I've used Netflix, HBO go, Amazon, Hulu is the only one that does this.I cancelled mainly due to the commercials but thier crappy streaming tech helped."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","“Don’t listen to folks who give an answer that could be the actual problem, just cancel this service because my personal experience was bad, even though others have it work without issue.”"
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",I've used Hulu on a 2.5Mbps connection without issue. So this is weird.
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","No issues on my end on Roku Stick, Xbox One and iOS devices, this is for NBC via on-demand and using Hulu Live."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",Most of the time the apps on the tv don't get updates etc. Processor in most TV are taking as well. Get streaming box of some kind. Always hard wire if possible.
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",I noticed my Hulu doing the same thing last night.  Buffered for 30 seconds every 3-5 mins. First time it's ever done that.&#x200B;I assumed it was something on the server side.
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",It was. It has had issues since Thursday's outage :( I wish they posted this stuff on more than just their support Twitter. 
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Here's my experience with Hulu.  I stream it on my Vizio smart TV and via chromecast without any issues.  Works great.  However, if I stream it through my Hulu app on my phone (connected via WiFi 200 Mbps down, Huawei Mate 9 (plenty fast for all video content)), I get stutters every few minutes.  All this is done on the same WiFiI think there may be performance issues with some of the apps on different platforms.  Overall, Hulu has been solid for me.  I rarely try to watch Hulu on my phone."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","I've had this same exact issue with Hulu myself. Using a PS3 to stream it. Verizon Fios internet. Never had any issues with any other service (Netflix, Amazon, HBO Go, VUDU) on this device. Sometimes it makes the show unwatchable.I prefer Hulu over Netflix in general, this is the only major complaint I have."

"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Same. Amazon, netflix, tubi, Terraruim...all fine. Hulu...pretty much unplayable except for one show at the time ""The Handmaids tale."""
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","I have the issue with my Samsung TV only, not the roku TV. On the Samsung I have to load the other apps then hard close them (holding the back arrow I think) to shut them down from running in the background. Then Everything works fine. "
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","You can check for connection hiccups that may only affect hulu by opening two command prompts (windows) or terminals (linux). In the first cmd/terminal window, type ping -t www.hulu.com for windows or just ping www.hulu.com for linux. In the second, try the same thing with www.amazon.com (netflix does not appear to answer ping requests, so that won't work). Observe the two windows for a few minutes and watch for dropped packets. You can leave the windows open and try to watch a show on hulu and then a show on another streaming service to see if either of the two windows are affected.This only works for packet loss. If there is throttling going on, you would need to measure throughput, and I don't really know a good way to do that specifically to hulu and back without maybe using a proxy or something."
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","I used to. When I had bad internet, most other applications would work fine (had higher buffer limits, maybe?). But, Hulu would frequently stop and have to buffer more then play and stop and play and stop. No other app had that issue. It was both Hulu's buffering and the shit ISP. Just not enough bandwidth to keep a constant stream. "
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","If you did this in the past couple days try again another time. Hulu is having streaming issues the past couple days but that isn’t normal. I love Hulu and all the content. Haven’t been able to access for two days, try again!!!"
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Exact same problem, but my Internet is from Spectrum. Hulu and Sling both have pretty aggressive stuttering on multiple Apple TV’s and Roku’s.  Switched to DirecTV Now and it almost NEVER stutters.  For what it’s worth, I have the streaming devices hard-wired, and watch constant PING’s to make sure my Internet isn’t dropping packets when those services stutter. It’s not - the Internet is SOLID but those constantly stutter. "
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",Hulu has had a lot of issues this week including a major outage Thursday night and a smaller outagw late yesterday. 
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?","Did you pause it? When I watch my Hulu Apps, if I pause it any time, it will freeze when I unpause it, UNLESS I rewind a few seconds after I unpause. Don't know why, but this works every time. "
"Got Hulu trial, watched one episode from NBC and had frequent pauses (maybe every 3-5 mins), is this normal?",I just wanted to chime in and say Hulu never buffers for me. We have had it for years and we have around 150mbps internet. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,TIL HBO has been around for 45 years. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Right? What the hell were they airing before the age of Sopranos besides Real Sex? 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Boxing viewership has been on a decline for sometime. I think they need to have more ota matches in primetime to get the younger viewers more interested. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,[removed]
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Younger viewers will never give two shits about boxing. They've grown up on MMA. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Boxing will never reach the popularity it once had. Not in a world of so many competing MMA sports, as well as the world's attention on CTE in regards to athletes."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Be Nice if they got into MMA/UFC
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Fox got some rights. CBS and NBC going in too. Weird times
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,I just don't care about boxing. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,TBH I'm not interested in seeing two massive dudes beat each other stupid. Seems kinda gay to me.
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Lack of boxing stars. I grew up on guys like Arturo Gatti, Roy Jones, Oscar De La Hoya, Naseem Hamed. These big personalities that would fight on Boxing After Dark regularly and maybe have 1 big ppv against another big opponent. Now the big names would fight once a year and only on PPVs."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"yeah man, that's definitely a huge part of it.  i grew up with holyfield, tyson, leonard, foreman, et al...hard to get better after that."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Big personalities maybe but I think the real issue is the lack of notable heavyweights since the mid 90s.
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Nah... there's plenty of stars in boxing right now: Lomachenko, Canelo Alvarez, GGG, Terence Crawford, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder are right up there with any of the guys you mentioned. And there are plenty of other networks that are putting more matches on than in recent memory (Fox/FS1, ESPN, DAZN, Showtime). The real news is it is just a shock that the network that was once the Cadillac of boxing networks is just packing it in."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"There's far too much money involved in it now. And the rules and structure of boxing has radically changed over time, and the way you earn money has become so broken it has deeply affected the rules of the sport to the point where if you're a young up and coming boxer you basically have two choices: either try and do boxing as an Olympic athlete and do it for the passion and love of the game and be dirt poor and live in a trailer or go pro and earn WAY more money with sponsorships and big Pay Per View fights on cable. There's a really good documentary about it called ""Counterpunch"" on Netflix that explains it in more detail."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Considering DAZN spent $1bn on Matchroom boxing cards, you have to fancy them to take the rights HBO are leaving behind.The article also mentions ESPN+ as a contender, though they have Top Rank cards already, maybe Disney will buy more?Interesting that after 45 or so years HBO just jacked it all in..."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Be interesting to see if DAZN remains an almost all all-fighting service, or if it gets picked up by someone like Netflix to bundle with their entertainment offerings, or even HBO."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Boxing is a rigged sport. Judges are corrupt. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Judges ruined boxing years ago.
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,That and they let the title holders dodge fights against legitimate contenders indefinitely.  
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"There are no more stars in boxing. As someone who grew up with a close family member involved in the fight game in Vegas for 25 years , the whole World used to stop when these big fights happened. Now , nobody cares and most folks think they are roided up anyway. It’s a dying , but great sport. "
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Despite there being more sports media today than ever before, they'd rather cover what Aaron Rodgers ate for breakfast than Friday night fights.  If Mayweather isn't on the card, no one bothers."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"There are stars, but people don't watch.  GGG, Canelo, Lomachenko, Lemieux, etc.  But yeah ufc had taken fight sport market share unfortunately.  Bummer"
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Damn, this makes me really sad.    I feel like I grew up on HBO boxing and Jim Lampley has been my absolute favorite commentator around.    "
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,To me Lampley is the voice of boxing. I hope he gets picked up fast.
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"That absolute sucks.  Just watched Alvarez Golovkin 2 and it was a classic.  Their commentary team is the best IMO.  Shobox might have a chance if they drop Malinaggi, but no one's coverage is a good as HBO.  It's a shame."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Malinaggi is on DAZN too, and Sky."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,Another target for ESPN+ HBO wants to shift its strategy to “high class” I guess. Doesn’t make sense to me. Boxing was a huge draw. 
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"I'd worry if ESPN added it to ESPN+ we will see a price increase. $4.99 a month is perfect for what they have now (maybe squeeze in some more soccer, La Liga etc)."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Yeah it really doesn't... the article cites that their biggest boxing broadcast this year drew only 1.3 million viewers, a number which would be about the same as the third-largest UFC pay-per-view of all-time. Other networks are getting into the boxing game while HBO is getting out. Definitely will be missed but boxing has survived worse haha"
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"If boxing was making them a lot of money, they wouldn’t be dropping it."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"As somebody who is more ""new age"" and grew up more on UFC I think these are valid reasons but the biggest reason why, is because boxing seems so rigged when I watch.    The last Manny Pacquiao fight was an easy one to call rigged.  And its Manny Pacquiao, one of the biggest stars in boxing.  But it was just lame to watch it.  It seemed so choreographed and even his opponent Lucas was caught smiling right after he was TKO'd.     So many fights just seem rigged and it seems so hard to get great fighters to fight each other.  It took Floyd vs Manny l at least 5 years just to fight.   UFC has alot of great fight cards on FS1 for free, the fights are not rigged,  they fight more often and they usually are able to get guys to agree to fight each other.    In boxing, after a fight, fans talk about how a fight was rigged or this person got robbed.In UFC, after fights, fans talk about the knockout and usually the worst they talk about is if a ref stepped in too early and stopped a fight.    Just the way fans talk about the sports shows you why Boxing is dying and UFC is getting bigger.  &#x200B;"
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Boxing and UFC both have great knockouts. The difference is that when it comes to a decision, the UFC decisions are not questioned quite as much (still some for close fights), while boxing judges cannot be taken seriously. In boxing, one party chooses the judges, pays them, and provides perks like air travel, hotels, meals, etc. So yea, any decision by the judges is suspect. Boxing is a beautiful sport, and it pays the fighters better than MMA. But the centralized control of the UFC allows it to provide a more competitive and clean product."
HBO dropping boxing after 45 years,"Loved boxing as a kid om the late 80's early 90's. Used to watch on ABC and take notes in a little book about boxing matches I saw. Still remember watching Julio Caesar Chavez beat Taylor with like 2 seconds left. Now, I don't even know who the heavy weight champ is. MMA/UCF interests me zero. Just too many boxing matches that looked ""fixed"". I don't trust the sport."

DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,I prepaid for the year upfront. I think it's fine and will only ever be a supplemental service. I don't think I will ever watch everything there. You really do have to try these things for yourself.
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"TL;DR: I like it and see it’s potential amidst its current shortcomings. I am 45, and I am enjoying it. After collecting comics for 15 years I stopped about 20 years ago. So the “older comics” some complain about are many that are new to me. It’s been fun catching up on titles I hadn’t heard of/read in the last 20 years. I can definitely understand if you have been reading comics recently, it might be “light” in the offering of the older stuff. I like there is media to watch as well. “Batman: The Animated Series” debuted when I was in college so there is a lot of nostalgia there. so have thoroughly enjoyed watching those again with my kids. B:TAS is worth the cost of admission in my personal opinion.  (Though I have my eyes on the HD remastered boxed set about to release!)I’m willing to give DC Universe some time before judging it too harshly. It will take time to build out the service. It took Marvel Unlimited, which I subscribe to as well, several years before it was worth the yearly cost, in my opinion. Only now is Marvel Unlimited really worth what they charge. Even Marvel Unlimited doesn’t have everything new or recent. They’ve had to pick and choose what they post. They started the service with the big crossovers and have since filled in with “regular issues.” I bet DC does this as well. I’m not going to put much judgement on the original programming until I actually see it. Here is why: I listened to the critics and the general opinions on “Justice League” and did not see it in the theaters. I watched it a few months ago on a long air flight. I really enjoyed it. Did it have its flaws? Of course, but honestly I enjoyed it more than “Infinity War.” I liked that DC kept the big bad pretty true to the comics. In the movie, Steppenwolf was an unabashed evil guy. DC didn’t retcon a backstory to make him a “sympathetic” character like Disney/Marvel does all their villains. Steppenwolf, though an odd choice of big bad (unless they were trying to kick off an Apokalypse multi-movie story arc) was bad. He wanted to finish his original mission of conquering Earth. Period. No daddy issues (Hela, Loki, Ultron) or making the big bad cry after he wiped out half the universe (Thanos). All that to say, I’ll give “Titans” “Swamp Thing” and the others a shot. Though they look bad in the trailers, they might turn out good, like the “Justice League” movie. Everyone’s mileage will vary, but I’m enjoying it. :)"
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,After seeing the content that’s on there...it’s goung to be a long while before I feel comfortable paying 7.99 for it. If ever. 
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"Yea, I agree. I may try the service, but I'm going to let it get some age on it first."
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,I didn't think it would be that expensive (was thinking annually maybe $50). Especially given what that can buy you elsewhere a month!
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,Bought it. Regret purchasing. The shows don’t look like they’ll be all that great. Tons of old movies I’ve seen 100s of times. Comics are old. This service I don’t think is worth paying $7.99/mo for. We’ll see what the future may bring.
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,I feel like the kind of person who is excited enough to pay for the full year in advance will probably run out of things to watch on DCU before the 2nd month is done. I'm trying to be nice on the Internet so I'll keep my comments about the Titans trailer to myself.
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"Waiting as well, CW and CW Seed will cover my DC needs for now."
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"Wow, some massive POS coward downvoted everyone who doesn't think DC Universe is worth it. Of course, that creeper is too gutless to own up to it."
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,When I see stuff like that on this kind of sub I assume companies have bots/employees that just swing through and shit on everything. I hope I'm wrong. 
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,There isn't much there. They have to beef up in a huge way what they have; right now it's not worth it.
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,Can you view offline too? 
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"I think I may get a month once Young Justice is completely up but I don't want to do it every month. 7.99 for a full season of YJ is worth it too me. And I guess during the month I'll check out everything else that's up.Otherwise, I'd wait until more of their exclusives are completed. I sure didn't want CBS for just that Star Trek and I never saw Good Wife so Good Fight didn't appeal to me. I think it just depends on if DC has enough content to interest you."
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,"Netflix produced around 1,000 hours of original content in 2017, which was available to a basic plan of $7.99. DC Universe has less than 5 original shows that I know of being debuted. I cant imagine that being over 100 hours for the same price of $7.99.I wanted to get this service but just standing back and looking at the offerings and price.. its just not worth it. You're pretty much paying 10X as much as Netflix for the amount new original content"
DC Universe - Has anyone tried it?,$7.99 for junk...  Wait for disney online 
"ClearStream 2MAX, ~$25 off at Wal-Mart (online only)",I got mine open box on Amazon for $28.00

Most of my stations are generally south of me with the exception of one LP with Bzzr, Gettv Escape, Cozi and some shopping.  Pointed one generally to the south central to the gaggle of towers with the networks, ect and have the other loan one pointed 25 degrees off those to the west to get that one.  Using a 4 way dist amp to feed 3 tvs and a homerun tuner.  Works well except for the living room tv.  It's the longest run and I lose that LP.  It's an older tv, about ready for an upgrade.  Need to move one of the newer ones there to see if they can get it."

"ClearStream 2MAX, ~$25 off at Wal-Mart (online only)",It's still a hugely over priced antenna for what it does.  There are much better options out there especially if you need VHF.
"ClearStream 2MAX, ~$25 off at Wal-Mart (online only)",I need both. I've used cheaper ones with worse reception.
Best Tuner?,Do you have a Roku or Apple TV? You can look at network tuners by silicon dust. With one you can access broadcast tv over your network.
Best Tuner?,Find an old VCR that has composite output
Best Tuner?,"Broadcast tv is 720p and 1080i, digital.Were VCRs made that could tune digital? Even if they could, outputting composite would destroy the resolution."
Best Tuner?,Did VCRs have tuners? 
Best Tuner?,All of the Asia manufactured boxes occasionally suffer from processor lockup. This one is no different. But the tuner itself is a better grade.Airbox shut down last year. They were broadcasting cable TV over the air. Their box was made in Taiwan. It has an HDMI  port.https://www.ebay.com/itm/AIR-BOX-Model-N8046A-HD-Reciever/323464037574?hash=item4b4ff584c6:g:oD8AAOSwDftbfc9s
Best Tuner?,"I bought the Homeworx HW130STB back in Feb 2017 and it’s still going strong. It’s on a TV that only gets used 3-4 hours per week, but the box itself has been plugged in non-stop for 18 months. "
Best Tuner?,"Hook it up to a PC, and then get a Hauppauge TV tuner card (or USB tuner).  Send the output from the PC to the display.  Bonus:  if the PC isn't a decade or more old, you'll have plenty of capability to also use it as a DVR."
ATSC 3.0‼️,"1.  It's not new.  We've known about it for close to 3 years today.  It was only finalized earlier this year.2.  Pheonix AZ, and WDC are broadcasting it right now3.  It's already being rolled out, but the broadcasting stations MUST simulcast for 5 years before they cut off ATSC 1.0.4.  Quit creating a panic."
ATSC 3.0‼️,"“Simulcast” just means the main channel in 480i, being shared with 6+ channels.  You won’t want to be forced to use the simulcast version."
ATSC 3.0‼️,It took almost 20 years for ATSC 1 to replace NTSC. We're only 5 years in on ATSC 3. I don't see ATSC being dropped before **2025** *much less* 2020. 
ATSC 3.0‼️,"The situation is different this time. There's going to be a long grace period before ATSC 1.0 is retired. Plus it's still gonna be a while before you can buy a device with a US compatible ATSC 3.0 tuner anyway, let alone there being any broadcasts in most of the country.TL;DR: We still have years until we need to start taking ATSC3.0 seriously."
ATSC 3.0‼️,This will be a completely different scenario. There is no forced roll out. Don't expect anything significant to happen that quickly. 
ATSC 3.0‼️,This isn't anything new....been in the works for a while now
ATSC 3.0‼️,"Or, buy, realizing the existing will be around for many many years."
ATSC 3.0‼️,"Disagree. As they transition, they will lower the resolution and cram several channels on a single ATSC 1.0 channel. There is not enough bandwidth to simulcast everything."
ATSC 3.0‼️,"atsc 3 will fail miserably because by the time it actually matures and is compelling,  they'll already be shutting down ota transmitters in favor of broadband streaming  over coax, fiber or the latest fixed 5g,  and if you are so rural that only otc works,  then atsc 3 will fail you as well, since it's ineffective without a low latency upload.atsc 3 is like gig internet - a great offer in search consumers who'll never need it.    *even if you consume more broadband in the future, compression algorithms  will keep improving, so your net speed requirements will not actually increase.*"
ATSC 3.0‼️,How many people actually use the existing tuner built into their TVs? 
ATSC 3.0‼️,"About 20,000,000 people in the USA alone.  Ever heard of OTA reliant households?"
External TV Tuner?,"If the TV has a tuner, can't you get the channels by manually entering the numbers on the remote?  For instance, if I want to watch METV in New York, I enter 33.1 on the remote to see it over the air.  CBS is 2.1, etc.  Have you tried that, or does it not have a tuner?There's also the Tivo OTA model that is pretty cheap (the older one, not the new one they have just put out).  It has a tuner.  I have a Bolt which i only use for OTA."
External TV Tuner?,Tcl Roku TVs only have a Roku remote. No numbers.
External TV Tuner?,"Won't work for cable.  You'll likely need something that has cablecard support (extra).With digital TV (OTA ATSC), if it doesn't pick it up in a scan, it's likely not going to work at all (even if forced).QCAM cable channels (somewhat of a rarity nowadays), might also be capturable without a cablecard.  I know there are PC card solutions for that... but QCAM is rapidly departing, so maybe not worthwhile."
External TV Tuner?,"Both Mediacom and ImOn have a few channels left that come through the coax.  None HD, but ESPN is one of them.  Looks horrible on a HD display though.  :)"
External TV Tuner?,"Believe it or not the channels are still analog, I believe. The system was owned by an old man that never bothered to upgrade because he was planning to sell out. The company that owns it now are having a lot of trouble cleaning up the mess left behind."
External TV Tuner?,"If the channels are analog, you might as well use composite. You could probably find a used VCR to use as an analog tuner pretty cheap. If you must use an HDMI input, you could use something like this https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009A6PJKQ/ to convert the composite to HDMI."
Stream Device Advice,"I have a roku on every tv. I think it's the only device that will let you play media from both google play and amazon. my rokus are all linked to the same account, so if you add a service to one it adds them to all.

Canadian Cord Cutters,"Depending on your location, an antenna is your best bet for local TV news and some hockey games.Sportsnet & TSN both have their own streaming services now. Unfortunately they each cost $25/month. Bell and Rogers both have IPTV services but they both require you to have unlimited internet plans and pay fees above and beyond the cost of internet for the TV services.A few smaller ISPs also have IPTV services but you again must subscribe to their internet services to access these.CRTC regulations prevent companies from launching stand-alone streaming services for locals that are NOT delivered via their own infrastructure. That's why you don't see streaming options here like you do in the US. "

I'm not sure when flex starts, the only one that may drop is November 11.  The 22nd is the Thanksgiving game.  That one won't change.  The 29th is a Thursday game.  That one won't change.If the Cowboys are doing well (doesn't look likely at the moment, but who knows), they could also gain more national games by flexing them.Likelihood|Date|Time|Opponent|Channel  ---|---|---|---|---High|Oct. 7|8:20 p.m. ET|at Houston Texans|NBC  Mid|Oct. 14|4:25 p.m. ET|vs. Jacksonville Jaguars|CBS  Mid|Oct. 21|4:25 p.m. ET|at Washington Redskins|CBS  High|Nov. 5|8:15 p.m. ET|vs. Tennessee Titans|ESPN  High|Nov. 11|8:20 p.m. ET|at Philadelphia Eagles|NBC  High|Nov. 22|4:30 p.m. ET|vs. Washington Redskins|Fox  High|Nov. 29|8:20 p.m. ET|vs. New Orleans Saints|Fox/NFL Network  Mid|Dec. 9|4:25 p.m. ET|vs. Philadelphia Eagles|Fox  "

I still maintain that there’s are the only streaming services to subscribe to. "
TV streaming services—ranked by catalog!,"Quality over quantity is why you subscribe to a channel like HBO. People don't subscribe to it for an extensive movie catalog, they subscribe for the excellent original TV shows/limited series plus the actually good movies HBO shows (all the Alien films have been on the app for months, for instance, and I'm definitely not mad about that).Whether you need something like HBO/Showtime 12 months a year is a different story, but there are many times throughout the year when I *need* HBO more than I ever need something of the Netflix/Prime variety, and I say this as someone who watches and enjoys many Netflix originals."
To return a cable box.,"Always save the return receipt. Keep it forever and never forget where you save it. In about a year or two, you will receive a charge saying you never returned it. It happened to me. Had to go to the return center to prove it. They lost all record of it. Until i had my carbon copy and the person who I returned it was the person I met with. ""Yep thats me. Okay. Let me remove this charge of $400."" Goddamn scammers."

After about 10 minutes of asking for alternative printed copies (and the girl throwing 20 something facial assaults and eye rolls at me the whole time) I thought to call the Spectrum number. I asked if they had the box as returned and that was the best I got. Now I'm worried.
To return a cable box.,"Yep, happens all the time. "
To return a cable box.,"I knew better. Kept my receipt. CenturyLink told me I didn't return their modem and charged me $110 for it.

To return a cable box.,"A few years back when I switched cable internet companies, the old one tried to charge me a massive no retun fee for not turning in a modem. From the day it was set up to the day I cancelled, I had used my privately purchased modem. It took nearly 12 hours on the phone to get the fee removed."
To return a cable box.,"Same here. I moved which is why I returned it so of course they never tried to email or call me. Just snail mail ""notices"" to my old address. Years later it pops up on a credit check that they sent me to collections. I fought and fought and called and called and they insisted they didn't have it and I owe $500. Eventually, once they sold off the ""debt"" to a collection agency they refused to even acknowledge that I owed money and said I had to work with the collection agency. I gave up and figured I'd just wait for it to fall off my credit in 7 years or however long it takes.  A couple years after that it started to get to me one random day so I decided to report it to the Better Business Beureau. And a few months after that I get a random call from some ""VP"" in Texas (I was a customer in California) that seemed really eager to help. I let him know the story and he said he would get back to me. I didn't expect a single thing to happen. A couple days later he sent me an email saying they found my cable box (had the serial number still recorded on my ancient closed account luckily) and it's been sitting in some storage warehouse for like 3 years but prior to that they had given it out to another customer. He got the credit ding removed and everything was fine after that. Super random lucky.  But fuck them. They knew damn well they gave that shit out to another customer. There's no way they didn't know. Fuckin scammers"
To return a cable box.,"YES! Always save the receipt. This saved my ass as well. Returned a modem to a Comcast storefront once. About 3 or 4 months later I started getting DMCA notices. Lots of them. None of them were warranted either.

Had to prove that I returned the modem, and had to compare mac addresses to my current one."
To return a cable box.,"This happened when I had to send back our DirecTV receivers. Luckily the lady at the mailbox place where I dropped it off said, ""Here, you'll need this.

They can't prove you owe them money and will usually back down. If they don't, ask them where to send a summons for small claims court."

To return a cable box.,"Yuppers! 100000x this! I saved a chat from Direct/Dish (I honestly can't remember it's been so long) with their return label links and took pictures of everything when I shipped it and followed tracking numbers down.

Every month I would simply send an email with pictures of everything.  Eventually they gave up and never turned it over to collections despite me 'owing them' well over $1000k. So weird right?Dickheads through and through."
To return a cable box.,"When I disconnected from Comcast the process was simple... I had to take my equipment in to their office, where they told me they did not HAVE a way to provide a receipt for the box.  I had to settle for a written receipt.  Then I was told I would get a final bill in a few weeks.  The following month I got a bill in the mail which included a disconnect notice for my failure to pay my bill.  So I called them up.  They did manage to correctly adjust my bill for the half month I did not have service, but they were unable to take a payment over the phone and told me to wait for the final bill.  A few weeks later I got the bill and called back.  Sorry, still can't take your final payment over the phone.  Can't pay from the website because my account has already been closed.  The only option they provided was for me to go BACK to the main office again.  Finally got that paid, and a month later I received a collections notice in the mail.  I can't wait until next year when they start trying to claim I didn't return the equipment.See?  Easy!*(My sarcasm tag can't reach this low, sorry)*"

To return a cable box.,"I disconnected from Dish network a few years back. They were supposed to send me a box to send the unit back. I never got it, and called them twice to find out why, and they said they would re-send one. And then life got busy and I didn't have time to keep doing their job for them, until I started getting collection letters that they were charging me for the unit. When I called them again to dispute this, they said it had been sent to collections and there was nothing they could do. And then I tried to buy a house not long after this, and this was on my credit and questioned by the lender. I had to write all kinds of explanation letters, and then my mortgage banker recommended I just pay it and prove I did so, if I want this loan to go through.  So I did. And although it caused quite the anxiety and almost derailed my purchase and pushed it back like 3-4 weeks, I did ultimately close on the mortgage. Thanks, Dish Network!"

To return a cable box.,"I'm a Spectrum subscriber, and I've dealt with them off and on (going back to the Time Warner Cable days) for years.  The Spectrum store that services my area is located inside one of our local malls here in L.A.; several years ago, I visited the TWC Store to return some equipment, and the actress Marla Gibbs was standing behind me in line.  She was carrying three of those long Motorola set-top boxes, and I know just one of them alone isn't light by any means...one of the security guards and I helped her carrying her boxes inside the store, and we sat the boxes on the counter-top for her.  Ms. Gibbs couldn't have been any nicer or sweeter, and engaged with us in line while we were waiting.Back to returning equipment...I learned that lesson early on, as I known of friends/relatives who didn't return the equipment, and get stunned when they're sent a $300-400 invoice on the boxes/remotes/etc.  Any time I disconnect from Spectrum (and DirecTV before that), I always make it a point to send them their equipment back ASAP."

To return a cable box.,I tried returning cable boxes after my former roommate passed away. Cable was in her name. They wouldn't take them back b/c I wasnt on the account....ok tried to do the right thing. Ended up putting them in the trash.
To return a cable box.,"The last time I returned a cable box, the lady in front of me was so angry she was standing in line that she was dragging it behind her on the floor by the cord like it was a leash and was banding it into everything she could along the way.  When it came time to turn it in, the representative took it and checked it in like it was any other box.  I felt sorry for the person who got it next.This was the same office that was short staffed, but had one person handing out numbers when you arrived and another person standing beside them to read the numbers out when it was time for someone else to come to the window.  It literally took two people to do the job of one person because of laziness."

To return a cable box.,lol the lady looks like she's about to hand over the box and mutter 'f- you! to the customer rep'
To return a cable box.,Add this to the list of reasons to be gald to have never subscribed to cable.  I've been cable free since 2000.

To return a cable box.,"Ended it with C*****t. Prepped by getting a different email a year earlier, and changed everything over. The day finally came, sweet freedom on the horizon. Stood in line, modem in hand, just like op's pic. After about an hour, my turn. ""How can I help you?"" ""I would like to cancel my account and return the modem (in my hand)"" After the account look up process interrogation, ""There seems to be a problem, you haven't terminated your account yet"" ""Yes I know, I am here today to cancel my account and return my modem"" After a bunch of fussing with my modem and ""testing"" it. ""Oh...we'll see what the total due is, you will have to pay that right now"" ""Oh...looks like we owe you $67"" ""Great, do I get that now?"" ""Oh no, it will take up to 6 weeks"" P'sOS!"

To return a cable box.,Ups worker told me the same thing about dish
To return a cable box.,"It's been years, but when i returned mine TWC had an address you could mail them to. It cost me $10 or $15 for the box and shipping but I just mailed it in so I had a receipt of who signed for it and never had to go wait in line. "
To return a cable box.,"Your right. Problem is the burden is on you to prove it’s not a legitimate bill. Most cable companies have you sign for proof they gave you the equipment, so if they charge you for not returning it and you have no proof that you did how well do you think that is going to go for you? It’s not illegitimate unless you can prove it. "

To return a cable box.,Lucky when I went yesterday nobody was there!
To return a cable box.,As much as I felt like I was getting ripped off with cable the people who worked at my location were always friendly and there was never a line. 
To return a cable box.,I don't know why but I seem to find cable boxes at thrift stores all of the time. Just last week my local salvation army had a sale on electronics and I bought 5 spectrum cables boxes for $1 each and got two 2tb WD green and three 1tb WD green hard drives out of them. I have harvested probably 15+ 1tb and larger hard drives out of thrift store cables boxes this year.

"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",That hurt my soul. Been watching HBO boxing since I was a kid. I get the business of it but my nostalgia is a hell of a drug.
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",Boxing and Game of Thrones were the main reasons I subscribed to HBO.
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",Same here with the boxing.  Been watching it for over 20 years on HBO.  
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","It's been great for me and the price isn't half bad either. They have a month free right now, so you can try it out!"
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",What's the price of it?
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",$15 through the app and as low as $5 on Directvnow.  Hulu and YouTube have HBO discounts also not sure the exact prices though 
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","I love it- it's the only app I have that doesn't stop and ask me ""Is anyone there?""  every few hours.   Works pretty flawlessly otherwise as well."
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",I wish someone in Hollywood would release a horror flick of users getting back at manipulative programmers. Needs plenty of gore!   :) Those dipshits.
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","I love it! I've been a subscriber since the day it launched (April of 2015). I originally subscribed to it via their app, but when Hulu (on-demand version) offered it as an add-on, I canceled it and added it to Hulu. Hulu offers user profiles and allows users to add whole shows, rather than just individual episodes as the HBO Now app did. (And I can still log into the HBO Now app (via the Hulu credentials.))"
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","Mixed feelings.   It crashes on my Roku 2XS almost every time I watch it.  Also, I think it took several months before Dolby audio output was available.    Audio/Video synching issues on the website have plagued it forever."
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",">  It crashes on my Roku 2XSI also have an old Roku 2 XS,  and also find the newest HBO Now app almost unusable.  When it does work,  it is super-slow to navigate.  (The version of the app I had during the prior season of Game of Thrones worked fine.)But when I re-upped HBO Now most recently I did it as an add-on channel to my Amazon Prime account,  rather than paying for it as a stand-alone channel.  So I can watch HBO content through my Amazon Prime app,  and it works fine.The Amazon Prime channel,  though,  does a poor job of showing you what content is available.  It has no ""newly-added"" content,  like the Starz channel has.  So every once in a while I go into my HBONow app just to see what new content is available.  If I see something I like,  I go back into Amazon to add it to my watchlist.Overall,  HBO is a solid channel.  With Netflix,  Amazon Prime,  Starz,  and HBO I have tons of content and my monthly bill is under $50.  But I still find myself buying the occasional TV series (like *Better Call Saul*) or newly-released movie I don't want to wait for (like *The Martian*).  "

"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",Just a heads up they announced today that they are dropping boxing
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","HBO had a special a while ago to get it added to hulu for $5/mo for 3 mo. We took advantage of this and we are at the end of our 3 months so we had to decide if we are going to continue for $15 or drop it.The movies were great but we kinda went through what we wanted to watch in about a month. We started watching Westworld, we are way behind on Game of Thrones, Barry was good, and I enjoy last week tonight. But of those shows, we have plenty of other shows and Westworld didn't grab us, we aren't current on Game of Thrones, Barry is done for the season, and I can watch the most importance part of Last Week tonight on YouTube and I usually do out of convience.So in the end we decided that hbo wasn't worth the $15/mo.I'm not sure it's worth the $5 promotional offer going forward. But I don't regret getting it. It was a nice option to have. Just too slow to get new stuff. "
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","Why do you need a DVR with HBO? That is what their ondemand service is for. It’s mostly available as soon as the episode airs/ends on the east coast. It’s one of the best things about the HBOGO/NOW service. As for quality, I’ve heard that if you have Amazon Prime the HBO service offered through there is better quality wise. Not 100% sure on live boxing on that platform however.  "
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",Def go with Amazon. They're almost double the bit rate. Dark scenes are still a problem but nowhere near as bad as HBO's apps.
"For people with HBO Now, how is it?",I have prime and a fire stick. So I should go with that?

"For people with HBO Now, how is it?","We've been HBO customers since 1983. Fired the cable company in 2013 and picked up HBO now soon after on the Rokus. Like the Rokus much more than the cable boxes. Still have concerns over their security so we isolate their network.HBO is a good product, and there really is no substitute. But I have noticed it's value has declined steadily through the years. Admit it's likely not of their doing...just Hollywood trying to squeeze more out of every customer (like the airlines).We're keeping them for now. But can imagine firing them too. Already fired Starz (which we also had since their beginning) because they got cutsy with their damn popups at the end of every movie. Not a brain among them - no one could figure out that customers won't stand for having the last five minutes blocked from the movie :) Sadly, I think that Starz is a better value proposition than HBO or Showtime. They turn their shows at a ferocious rate. Takes special effort to kill advantages like that :)"
Locast Roku App Issues With Geolocation,"Locast sent me an email. I am happy they responded quickly and am very happy with what they wrote. Evidently this is an issue they're having with others as well. They thanked me for the data, saying it's big help in isolating the issue. They said that geolocation is more difficult on the Roku (than browsers, I think) and asked me to please bear with them as they try to resolve the issue."
Locast Roku App Issues With Geolocation,"Thanks for following through. Hopefully they can work something out.My idea of a fix would be letting you login on another device that's on the same IP, and use that device's geo-location info to calibrate the IP address' location. Using your phone's GPS for example while it's on WiFi."
Locast Roku App Issues With Geolocation,"If possible, try contacting Locast. Since there is an account involved, maybe they can provide you with an alternative means of verifying your location."

Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,"It makes sense that Tivo or any other DVR working on a cable system can do this, because it's actually recording that content locally, from a single source, and indexing all that metadata.Roku is nothing more than a computer that can run various discrete apps developed by the streaming platforms. To the extent that the Roku itself can gather and provide to you information about what you've already watched on say, Hulu, it's not because it's keeping track of what you're watching in the moment as it's playing. Even if it could do that, that would only give you that information on *that* specific Roku. Which wouldn't be very useful for people watching on multiple devices. Rather, it's able to do this because the Hulu app developer has exposed that watch history data via an API and the Roku devs have built functionality to use it.I've never used WatchAid, but it sounds like it just gathers public information about certain shows (when new ones are released) and then just helps you get to that content on your platform of choice. Does it also somehow keep track of what you've watched on those platforms? If it does, I'm guessing it does that by logging into that platform on your behalf and collecting your watch history data.Hulu does have a search functionality that can search for specific content across all platforms. But it doesn't need any information about *your* account to do that. It simply needs to know publicly-available show release info, and cross-reference that with what apps you happen have installed on your Roku.tl;dr: this type of functionality is possible only if the individual streaming platforms expose that data to Roku and Roku is programmed to collect, organize, and display it back to you in a helpful way.Apologies if I've misunderstood your question. Cheers.EDIT: Thinking about it some more, I suppose that if Roku wanted to just unilaterally monitor and log your watching behavior/keep track of played episodes/etc., it could at least sync that information back to your Roku account, and it would be available on your other Rokus. But again, that wouldn't be helpful on other streaming devices."
Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,"I'm fine with it living on a single device. I'm sitting in my family room to watch TV for the night... I turn on my device (AppleTV, Roku, Fire Stick, whatever)... and I am presented with a list of my shows to watch. Its really a simple concept. Yes, WatchAid does exactly that. I open the episode from within the app, I watch it, then it marks that episode as watched. The app tells me which episodes I have or have not watched. Its almost perfect.. except that its a 3rd party app that may be going away before too long.&#x200B;"
Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,"As the other guy alluded to, there's just no practical way to implement such a feature without a centralized player and database. That would require deep integration with each supported service, which could limit other functionality those services provide. It would be near impossible for many services to want to cooperate on that.Even if the device maker were to go out on its own and implement such a feature, supporting it would be a nightmare because of the lack of official APIs for them to use, and it'd be just as clunky as any existing third-party tracking apps now.The only reasons why DVRs have been able to implement such a feature is because they usually only deal with limited services to begin with, and are fully in charge of metadata and playback."
Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,"On each of these platforms (I believe), I can search for shows within each app. So obviously there is some kind of API access. Now, maybe it doesn't go down to the episode level... that would make sense.&#x200B;"
Why don't streaming boxes have a built-in way to keep track of watched and/or new episodes?,Plex keeps track but you have to set up a server.  It's simple to do 
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"It sounds like  a great product with 4 tuners and the Tivo interface, but seeing the cheaper Roamio OTA being replaced is bittersweet. I'm sure they'll have deals, but $250 for the device and $250 for a lifetime guide service makes the entry price pretty high. "
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,Why do you need a Tivo guide?  The broadcast stations send one for free with the signal.  (My DTVpal shows 14 days in advance.)
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"Too pricey, the killer is the monthly fees. Give that for free and you have a competitive product.You can get a Amazon Recast for $279 and a Fire TV 3rd gen for under $80 or a Tablo with 4 tuner with hardrive and lifetime subscription for less.  You could even get an Nvidia Shield, 4 tuner Hdhomerun, Plex pass and a 1tb hard drive for about the same money. Yes I understand that the Tivo is easy to use and would have a high wife approval factor."
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"> ~~1gb~~ 1TB hard drive.But yeah, I agree. TiVo seems to have basically given up on competing and is instead just doubling down on their existing fan base that still buy TiVos because that's what they're used to.There's just too many more affordable options to recommend these days. Plus, Tablo's lifetime subscription can even be transferred to new devices, so that makes it even more attractive for when you inevitably need to upgrade the device in several years to support ATSC3.0."
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,I've had tivo for a couple years and am dumping it for a HD Home Run setup because I think it's a terrible interface - not easy to use. It's also laggy with unnecessary animations. My wife and kids also do not like it. It's definitely the most archaic of all the interfaces we have available while also being the most expensive. I have Nvidia Shield on my main rooms and Roku in others. Tivo is just so dated and the new interface isn't much of N improvement.
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"Read this article and and find it interesting where they are making their money from.https://www.engadget.com/2018/09/27/tivo-bolt-ota-dvr/To quote the article:""At this point, the company makes most of its money from licensing deals with cable operators, only 15 percent of its business comes from consumer devices.""I know they sued Dish over their DVR (I had Direct TV with Tivo and  then Dish with DVR back  to back and found  them to be similar) and likely making money from Direct TV as well. "
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,TiVo has one thing going for it.  It's easy to use just like the Roku.  So people who cut the cable will find it easier to do.  Only downside is you pay a premium to make it that easy.  At least Roku is cheap.
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,Totally true but for the most part I would think something like Tablo or the new Recast. product is easy to use as well.People only want to learn what they want to learn.  If it is important enough and they want to save money they will learn it.
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"Using an old Bolt as an OTA-only device, I am wondering if I can get the same lower monthly / annual service fees as the new box."
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"Well from some of the articles I read, I don't  think that will happen. I encourage you to think about getting a Tablo or a Amazon Recast. How much are you paying now? Most of the complaints seem to be centered around the cost of the subscription."
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,">The only downside, as usual, is the price: $250 for the hardware, and either $7 a month or $70 a year service plan. You could also go all in with TiVo and pay a flat $250 for lifetime service.Nope.   I might have bought the box for $250 but I'm not paying $70 a year for what's essentially a fancy RSS feed of publicly available program scheduling."
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"On top of that, their guide is lousy at flagging repeats. Even though I have Colbert and Kimmel set to record only new episodes, it often records repeats and flags them as new!"
TiVo targets cord-cutters (again) with the Bolt OTA,"TiVo needs to partner with one or more of the MVPD streaming services (YouTube TV, Vue, etc.) Or create their own subscription cable streaming service as Silicon Dust did for the HD HomeRun. Combined with the TiVo hardware, that would be an impressive combination. Though they also need to allow streaming boxes to run content on secondary TVs throughout the household. Spending $100-150 on a TiVo mini for every set is not an ideal business model. "
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","I have Windstream and have for years. It is dependable, phone customer service is very helpful, but scheduing service in home is vexing. You get that whole ""somewhere between noon and 6pm"" crap.  I only pay for 12 mbps and can stream two at a time no problem- husband regularly watches sports upstairs while I binge watch whatever downstairs, usually while surfing online at the same time. And I'm sure he's on his phone most of that time, too. Once in a while something buffers but not badly enough for me to pay more- it's usually an app problem, not a speed problem."

"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","The only thing you have to look for when getting DSL is how far you are from the DSLAM. The further away you are, the slower the service you will get."
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","I've had no issues with Windstream beyond a short outage here and there over the last couple years.  We have their 75 Mbps plan and it's been working fine.  They now offer new ""Kinetic Internet"" plans at 1 Gbps (reg price $75) and 200 Mbps (reg price $45).EDIT:. I called them tonight to ask about upgrading to their Kinetic plans.  I was met with confusion and bad information.  The two CSRs I spoke to we're clueless.  In the end, like every other provider, they don't care about their existing customers.  They won't offer existing customers the 200 Mbps plans.  New customers only.  They will upgrade me to 1Gbps for a huge price increase.  No thanks."
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","100% agree on the Cox ""arm and a leg"".. I'm stuck paying $82.99/mo for 50/5 (actually may be 100/10 as they did increase speed the last time they raised the rate). My purchased modem won't handle 100/10 as its an Surfboard SB6121, which only has 4 downstream channels). I'm planning on dropping down to a lower tier to try and cut down on my bills..."
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","I give Cox $300 a month.  Phone, cable, internet.   I'm looking to cut that down a bit.   I've never watched 3/4 of the channels i am forced to pay for.   I want to try cut the cord.   "
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","We're down to just Internet with Cox. We removed the phone, cancelled cable. We're still paying them $130 a month (premium 150mb with unlimited data) but we're using Rokus and YTTV for our cable. Works great. Total is now $170 instead of $210 to Cox.YTTV is missing some channels (TLC, History, AMC, A&E, etc.) we wish it had but a lot of that you can find other ways. It's great for sports and it has our big 4 local channels. We love that you can assign gmail accounts to devices and customize for individual watchers and DVR services. It has unlimited DVR!If you switch, keep an eye on your data usage so you aren't going over 1024gb per month. We were so I switched us to unlimited data.Other nice thing is that YTTV has only raised their rates once. Cox seems to do that with cable every couple of months."
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","I have Cox and dropped Phone and Cable and maxed out internet (300/30),$115/month. I do pay a fee because I only have one service. I usually have 15 devices on it without having any issues, but I also have Google WiFi so that really improved my network. I am looking to increase to Gigabit but need to by a new modem. The one issue I am having is we are using our 1TB of data every month. I can increase my data package but it would increase my bill by $30 month for 500gb more. I would love to get Sonic, but it is not available in San Diego.  I have heard good things about Sonic which offers Gigabit service for $60/month. "
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","As a network and systems administrator, I have had the displeasure of working with windstream on numerous occasions at three different companies that I’ve worked for. I can’t speak to their residential service, but their business service is god awful. They are commonly known as the absolute WORST ISP to deal with and you should NEVER and I mean NEVER buy anything from them other than a WAN connection. Their implementations teams are absolutely useless. Their tech support is terrible. Their reliability is terrible. I do not care how much cheaper they are, I can never in good conscious recommend them to anyone for any reason. "
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","Where I am Windstream is a monopoly and they are horrible. They only offer dsl, and it has been horribly unreliable. I have a bonded connection, and 1-2 times per month for over 6 months of the bonds would fail and wreck my speed. They finally got it figured out, but it took me a good six months to get through to a tier two tech. Even after so many onsite visits from their techs. After all this trouble, Windstream gave me a $50 discount on one bill after I asked if there was anything they could do for my troubles. To further add insult, the introductory rate in my area is $20 less per month than what I pay. I played the tried and true customer loyalty card, and they shut me down real quick. Said it's for new customers only, and i should be happy paying $100 a month for 20mbps, because that rate was grandfathered in. And if I ever ditched their service, I'd probably come back and they'd make me pay more.Fuck Windstream. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. "
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?",Where are you located? I am curious if their service is different in different locations
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","When I had Windstream the service was pretty solid.  We only had one outage in 4 years.The one outage I had was a real nightmare to get resolved though.  They kept pushing out their ""commitment time"" (their term not mine) without telling me, so I would have to call in to find out why nothing had happened.  Over the course of 2 days the commitment time went from 2-3 hours to over a week.  Again, with no proactive communication from them.  At one point the ticket was actually stuck in limbo and wouldn't have gone any further if I hadn't called for an update. While it felt like I was getting jerked around the whole time the most frustrating part was that they told me I was going to have to wait more than a week for a tech to come to my house, so the next day I called to cancel my service and they were able to fix it remotely in about 30 minutes while I was on the phone with retentions.They did offer some token discount to make up for the trouble, but I played the ""to little, to late"" card to get some pretty good on going discounts.Tl;dr service is mostly good, but when something goes wrong don't expect a quick resolution"
"Cox Cable sucks... Any Windstream reviews? Also, what mbps best for streaming?","What quality do you want?- You can stream one Standard Definition video as low as 0.5 megabits per second.- One 1080p HD stream would need 3 Mbit/s minimum.- 2160p ultra HD approximately quadruple:  12 Mbit/s- If you have more than one person in the house, multiply all these numbers by X number of people.  My SlingTV app lets me choose as low as 0.8 Mbps. Amazon's app goes as low as 0.3 gigabyte per hour of video (that's 0.7 Mbit/s). "
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,"Making some assumptions here...1 hour of streaming AM + 2 hours afternoon + 4 hours evening = 7 hours per day.  Three people in the house, each streaming to their own device (?) would equal 21 hours of combined streaming. Even if all 3 people are watching the same program in separate rooms, you’re using 3x the amount of data. 21 hours per day x 30 days = 630 hours. And that’s not including any possible higher usage on weekends (not working, watching sports, etc.) Netflix claims its HD streams use about 3 GB per hour. At that rate with a 1 TB data cap (?), you need to stay under 333 hours of streaming per month or about 11 hours per day. And that’s before factoring in ALL OTHER DATA USAGE: web browsing, email, social media, YouTube, software updates, PC and console game downloads, school work, etc. If you want to control things externally, about the only thing left to try is getting a high-end router with good QoS features. Then you could limit the bandwidth available to each streaming box. But that is likely to have unpredictable results. Some services may scale-down to a lower than HD image. Others may just buffer and stutter if you try to limit their access to the pipe. The only true fix is to watch less TV. Or buy an uncapped internet plan. Or go back to cable/satellite."
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,"You can get a custom router that enforces data limits PER user/device on your home network.  Try OpenWRT on a nice router. If you are using the comcast router get rid of it, get a nice cable modem, get a nice router. Stop paying the monthly fee on Xfinity rent.  Plenty of guides to google for how to.  Set up something like Gargoyle, follow the videos, enforce data caps for devices / users.    You can monitor bandwidth on a decent router maybe even the Xfinity, and see who /what is eating it all.  &#x200B;"
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,I thought the cap on Comcast was 1TB. Did they lower it even more?
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,I bit the bullet and upgraded to unlimited for $50/month. I have 2 kids and they stream all the time and I was well over 1TB every month. Its ridiculous that we have caps on home based internet

I decided to switch to a business line but Comcast unlimited business was more expensive than my package of Cable, phone and internet combined.  I switched to a business line with Centurylink for 65.00 a month with no cap and guaranteed speed.  I just hope it's better.  It kinda feels like I had to choose the lesser of 2 evils.  But I have very little choice of providers.  "

End of the rope with bandwidth limit,Best you can do is be patient and wait for the corrupt Xfijity Empire to be taken down with lawsuits.  Then welcome all the Provider competition.  It's really a shame these providers crippled us with caps.
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,What providers are being prevented form coming to your area by Xfinity? And which one would come in if Xfinity went away? No one is spending million on infrastructure to come your town for little return
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,"The data cap for Xfinity is 1TB right?  We average about 500-700 GB a month as a 3 person household (one toddler) on two 1080p TVs, two smartphones, two laptops, and an iPad.  Wife and I work 8-5, so all of our data consumption, for the most part, is in the evenings and on the weekend.  I can't even imagine trying to stay under 300 GB."

End of the rope with bandwidth limit,> Is there anything else I can have them do?You can call Xfinity to upgrade your service to a higher tier (possibly called business line).  If that's not an option then convert to standard cable & watch TV via the cable channels.
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,"TOAST.NET internet has no data caps.  Its basically ATTs product sold through a different company.  No other products to buy.  Not available everywhere, but you should check out their website for prices and availability."
End of the rope with bandwidth limit,Assuming you don't have someone leaching your wifi (neighbor) and you are being accurate with estimates you could trouble shoot to make sure xfinity isn't just making shit up. Change your wifi password and only update one thing at a time and you might get a better expectation of which device is pulling what data through your router/modem. I recently bought the linksys velop for my house due to poor signal in the back/corners of the upstairs and it has a really good admin system. You can prioritize devices as well as turn things off and set timers (so you can literally block everything but your phone at say 9pm so even if kids are 'asleep' they can't even access the internet).It's not a cheap alternative but made prioritizing my house MUCH more simple and was able to narrow down some random things like my ring doorbell and other security cameras.

Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,"You probably can get away with a 30-40 mile omnidirectional indoor antenna if you just want most of the green channels, though you'll have to fiddle with the placement to get certain channels.But you'd need some kind of 180° multi-directional outdoor antenna if you want those channels that are coming from the North West, or worst some kind of combiner setup with multiple unidirectional antennas to get those red channels."
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,Thanks!
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,I notice most of these come attached with rg59 cable. Should I be concerned with it not being tri/quad shielded rg6? Or detachable so I could switch it out?
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,"Had some cheap rabbit ears, but moved recently to a little bit further out than I was. I'd like to get all the green channels down to WZRB. I'd rather do an indoor antenna, but I'm not sure I can get all these. I'd just rather not get into working in the attic and running cables in walls."
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,You pretty much have to build something if you want an indoor antenna with better performance. Example:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j80C9d1o9Y* http://imageevent.com/holl_ands/multibay/4bay/superm4?p=3&n=1&m=-1&c=3&l=0&w=1&s=0&z=4 (mclapp dimensions)>...and running cables in walls.The traditional approach with attic antennas is to run the cable down beside the plumbing stack pipe into the basement. Often an outdoor antenna can be easier because you can just run the cable/ground down the outside of the house to a hole drilled in the frame of a basement window. You stay in the clean outdoors rather than having to face the unpleasant environment of many attics.
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,Is your TV by a window?  Perhaps do trial and error with an indoor antenna or two.  That's what I did.  Returned one because it couldn't pick up the stations that were 30-ish miles away (when placed on an interior wall not near a window).  Eventually had to go with an outdoor antenna.  Good luck!
Another ubiquitous antenna suggestion post,"Maybe 5 feet or so. Not sure what direction. I can post that later today. My concern is that I have a 16 month old. I don't want to have to run wires in walls. Does anyone have experience with those wire hiders you can screw into a wall?If an attic or roof antenna is the best option, I'll just take a loss on this battle. ☹️"

Recommend an OTA Antenna + HDHR?,Are you planning to drop cable services? Or do you not receive broadcast networks with whatever cable services you’re using?
Recommend an OTA Antenna + HDHR?,"Good question. I currently receive these channels in my cable package but I'm still trying to find a better plan with Comcast (on their sub). If I can't get a good TV+internet plan, I might drop to just internet.Either way, my understanding is that the quality of OTA is much better than what comes from the cable pipe so it would be worth adding the antenna if I care about quality, right?"
Recommend an OTA Antenna + HDHR?,"In addition to the UHF signals, I see a couple of popular networks in the VHF-high band (NBC, PBS) and a bunch of less popular ones on a transmitter (WDWW) that will be moving to the VHF-low band in the next few years:* https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&callsign=WDWW#stationSo you might want to take a look at the channels on WDWW and decide of the extra large antenna required to get VHF-low band is worth it. You can click on the little arrow to the right of the channel name to go to the associated website. Otherwise, you probably want something like one of these:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018If you have the room (14' long) you can use this high gain antenna to get more reliability channels:* Winegard HD7698PTry to keep the HDHR somewhat away from the antenna in case it produces interference. The same applies to the network cable."

So whatever TV package you select, you'll need access to those channels. I believe that limits things to Playstation Vue, Sling, YouTube TV and DirecTV Now because Fubo doesn't carry ESPN and Hulu doesn't carry NBA TV.NBA League Pass has all games (local black outs) with local replay available after the game has aired + classic rewind games and some other features (VR apparently). You can select a single team to reduce the cost (thanks u/MyFriendMaryJ). It also offers a radio only stream (thanks u/ShakethatYam)If you are targeting your local team you'll need to investigate what carriers offer your local channels. Philly for example needs to carry both NBCSports Philly and Philly+ due to the Flyers taking up one of the two channels.XM also offers streaming of radio play by play.I can do a quick NHL write up too as they vary on national channels but the concept is the same.**edit to meet sub rules"

"Now that the NBA season is about to start, can the mods (or anyone else) create the ""Cordcutter's Guide to Watching the NBA""?","As a fellow NBA fan, I've done a little research into this.  Sling Orange - you get ESPN, ESPN2 and TNT.  A majority of the good games are there and it's like $25 a month.  ABC - Over the air HD antenna. I have not looked at how to get subscriptions for network channels. Local games - This is where it gets tricky.  All of my local games are on Fox Sports 1 which is part of ANOTHER Sling package that doesn't include ESPN or TNT.  So you could get a package that includes both but now you're pretty much paying cable prices ($40).  NBA League Pass - You can get all the games EXCEPT the ones on national t.v. (TNT, ESPN, ABC) and/or on your regional channel (FS1 in my case).  This sucks because every year there are good match-ups exclusively on TNT and ESPN that you will miss out on if you just get league pass.My choice: Last couple of seasons I got the Sling package that included TNT and ESPN and I have an over the air antenna for ABC games.  I did not care to watch my local team because, well, they have sucked for the last few years and I know I wasn't missing much (LOL). I would order right before the season started and end it right after it ended (or the Finals begin since all of those games are on ABC).  It used to be $19.99, then $22 and now it's $25.  It has gotten progressively better with the exception of a few seconds of lag from real time.  The only reason this sucks is that if you are watching it and discussing the game real time online with other fans, then they see the action before you do and your comments are slightly delayed.. OR they could tell you spoilers (like for example if a game winning shot went in or not).  For THIS season there is a lot of interest in my local team and I think I might bite the bullet and get the Sling Orange + Blue package for $40. My cable t.v. has a promo package for $45 that includes 125 channels (including TNT, ESPN and FS1).  I am seriously considering going the cable route because it's only $5 more and it is in true real time and less chance of interruption.  It suck that these are the only options that exist right now but until they figure something else it's all we got *shrug*"

FWIW my fiancée is a big NBA fan and we end up getting the DirecTV NOW package that includes the NBA network for like $60/month during b-ball season; the service occasionally has tech issues but is generally ok and has all/most local stations for your in-market games (to my knowledge).

So how does this all work?,"The summary is... video media is transitioning to be transmitted over TCP/IP networks instead of over coaxial cable to the back of your tv.   Fast forward to now, we are in a phase of your television/media being transmitted via your network, to essentially a smart television device (or set top box basically).. You purchase your package from the same middleman as with traditional cable.  But, there are more options today; Hulu, YouTube TV, Sling, DirectvNow, Fubo, Philo, and soon to be a few more options in 2019 and beyond.The problem that exists, still.. is that the media corporations that own the content, control what ""channels"" that the middleman gets and sells to you.    There is no service that allows you to just subscribe to, for example.. all of the Viacom channels by themselves... of if you just want local channels + Fox News.. + the A&E network channels... etc.. etc.."

"Getting parents off of cable and bought a roku stick, having a hard time figuring out best options to watch what they like?",sling works just like your cable system did.  You have a guide that shows you what is showing.  Has on demand as well.  Whether or not locals are available depend on where you live and what packages you chose.  I would look at an antenna and either a tablo or airtv for locals.

You may be able to get locals at their address try tvfool.com to check and see what OTA channels are available. As far as Hallmark or any other cable channel goes you’d have to subscribe to sling or Directv Now at which point you should have just kept cable because they are unreliable. The idea with cutting the cord is that you will be okay with services like Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime only whereas you don’t/won’t need cable channels.

Any hope for my new location?,It's gonna be hard. You'll probably need a large unidirectional antenna pointed north of you want anything other than PBS. An amp will probably be needed too.
Any hope for my new location?,Will my combo between a DA-290 and a HDB4x be sufficient?
Any hope for my new location?,[Omni] directional antennas have poor reception (because they are looking everywhere).  It is better to get a directional antenna that focuses on just one area (due north).
Any hope for my new location?,maybe a cm4228hd
Any hope for my new location?,"If you get downto -96 power you'll still get the same sensitivity.  So down to KXLY (probably).  You'll want to raise the antenna as high as possible, so it can see over those edges."
Any hope for my new location?,"That's an issue, I'll need to ask the LL if I can put in an aerial on the roof, as I'm on the second floor, (have the entire thing to myself), but no exterior exclusive areas of control, so I'll need to ask permission to mount an aerial to the roof."
Suggestions for getting more channels.,You have a close transmitter in the same direction as your super weak target networks. That can make things difficult. It's like trying to see the stars with a bright street light shining in your eyes.You said you might not need all 4 networks... The strong signal is in the VHF-high band. If you were to give up on ABC you could try a high gain UHF band antenna which would tend to reject the strong signal in the band it is not designed for. Such an antenna would be significantly smaller as well. Examples:*Yagi type** Antennas Direct 91XG (rumoured to have the best performance for a Yagi type)* Solid Signal HDB91X AKA Stellar Labs 30-2370*Bay type** Digiwave Ant7285* Solid Signal HDB8X AKA Digiwave Ant7288 AKA Stellar Labs 30-2431 (adjusted flat)* Winegard HD8800capability)* Antennas Direct DB8e (adjusted flat)No guarantees how well this would work... You would probably at least get Fox. You could use this preamp:* RCA RCATVPRAMP1R (has separate VHF/UHF inputs)... and connect your antenna to the UHF input. That would help reject the close VHF-high band transmitter. You can try first without the preamp.
Suggestions for getting more channels.,"> It's like trying to see the stars with a bright street light shining in your eyes.Bad analogy, because  TV stations are Single Frequency stars, and you can filter-out the specific ones you want to see.  That's what tuners do.  "
Suggestions for getting more channels.,"It'll be difficult, but possible, with a roof antenna, a high-quality preamp, and high-quality coax.One complication is that your ABC (WTNH/WCTX) is on high VHF, so  if you want that, your antenna must have VHF dipoles."
Suggestions for getting more channels.,91XG is a good antenna to try. CM4228HD DB8e are my preference. Get it outside and on the roof and see what happens. I've had an old style CM4228 for a long time and it handles VHF Hi ok too. Looks like your biggest issue is some way to point it in different directions too. If the antenna you pick works you could always add a rotator to the antenna
Suggestions for getting more channels.,Buy the Winegard Flatwave Air (the black boxy one).  Or a CM4228

"Thursday Night Football Tri-Cast (FOX, NFLN, Amazon Prime)",Is one of the questions about picture quality? It's definitely HD but something looks a little....off. Frame rate maybe? Just bought a Roku and this is my first streaming game.
"Thursday Night Football Tri-Cast (FOX, NFLN, Amazon Prime)","I'm actually looking forward to hear Hannah Storm and Andrea Kremer calling the Amazon Prime games.

I thought the blackout rule only applied to cable-only games (which this is not) that are syndicated on a local station only in the two team's primary markets (and blocked on the cable network in those two markets). Since this is a nationwide simulcast on NFLN + FOX, I would expect it to be available on both channels in every market.

Tech Support Question for Tablo Users,"I haven't seen this, but I also use the recommended settings."
Tech Support Question for Tablo Users,"It's probably related to the 10Mbps setting, though I'm not sure why. As for why only certain channels are affected, it could be related to weather the channels are broadcasting in 1080i or 720p. Original bitrate might play a factor too."

Cable One vs. Century link,I have the same options where I live. We use Century Link. On a average day we have two TVs streaming and 3 computers or tablets using the internet. Maybe once or twice a year we’ll have problems to the point that we can’t get online. For the price difference (we pay $45 a month) it’s worth it to us. 
Cable One vs. Century link,"> I'd have to buy their highest level at nearly $200/monthOr you could modify the settings in all your Video-streaming TVs, phones, etc to ""lowest quality"" which would be SD.  That will dramatically drop your data usage."
Cable One vs. Century link,"yeah, I may do that with some devices, but having HD devices so we can watch things in HD...only to not be able to use that option is BS."
Cable One vs. Century link,"I have a Cable One business plan. It can be a struggle for them to allow you to get it set up, but I eventually got it. And it has been rock solid reliable (unlike when I had the residential version at a previous place), with no caps. 50 Mbps DL/5 Mbps UL which is on the slower side, but fast enough for my wife and I. It always hits those speeds (usually above it by a little). $63 a month. We could upgrade to 100/10 for $50 more but not worth it for us.CenturyLink has the worst possible customer service, and DSL is never going to be terribly fast (and 20 Mbps would be on a good day). And the quality varies widely by neighborhood. Best case scenario, it could work out, but it wouldn't surprise me if it doesn't. I've heard their fiber is good though (though customer service pains getting it set up, still), but that's not available in my neighborhood."

Old antenna in attic,My guess is if you’ve got the cable? Probably still works. I had old rabbit ears for a couple years and it picked up all the channels in HD. But my guess is that probably will still wprk as long as the cable is good. I’m not even sure what adapter you’d need. If you’ve got a TV hook it up with the coax and it will probably work fine. Unless you’ve got an older TV that needs a digital converter box.

Old antenna in attic,"Well “new” Digital TV channels use the same frequencies as the old analog stations, which is why the old analog had to be retired to allow the new digital broadcasts as the signals would interfere (kind of like when your fax and voice were on the same line).  The radio waves are all the antennas care about. Mostly digital went into UHF, particularly early days, but eventually also VHF.  If all the hardware and cables are still good, it should work. Like others said, no harm in trying."
Old antenna in attic,"Probably will work better than any new ""HD"" antenna.  It's probably pointed in the right direction for you.  Plug it in and let us know."
Old antenna in attic,that antenna is a weird design and it looks like someone modified it.. it does not follow normal designs for a UHF VHF TV Antenna.. &#x200B;if that cable is coax you can try it.. people put paperclips in their tv coax connector and get signal so that mass of garbage in your attic might get you something.. if not you can replace it. pretty cheap.

HGTV and History on,"No word.  HGTV is owned by Discovery and History is owned by A+E Networks.

"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Can they just get better movies? It's like they took the DVD collections of 5 people and one anime fan.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","Nowhere to turn to for movie licensing anymore. Warner is moving all their stuff to HBO/DC/WB services. Disney and Fox will be split up between Disney’s service and Hulu. Sony, Universal, Paramount then is what’s left and all the different streamers will compete for those rights. "
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",5 people that buy all their DVDs in the $5 bin at Walmart.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","I think Amazon has good movies.  Every month I look at their list of ""movies expiring end of month"", and then watch about 30-40 of them... all rated 7 or higher on IMDb.  I have yet to exhaust all the movies (or TV shows) I wish to watch on Amazon Prime."
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Get Netflix by mail if you want  big studio movies.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Anime fans are people too. So I hear.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","They have a great movie selection!  Just not on streaming.  The core Netflix service for me is and always has been the DVD/Blu-Ray rental.  The streaming service is something I subscribe to on and off again, based on the release of the Originals.  Stranger Things comes out, I add streaming to my service for 1 month, binge watch it and watch a bunch of other stuff, then cancel. Even if Netflix had every movie in their DVD/Blu-Ray catalog available as a stream, I doubt that would change my habits.  I still prefer the quality of a Blu-Ray and would wait the 2 days for a Blu-Ray disk to arrive. "
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","Netflix Originals started out good, felt like original curated content (Beasts of No Nation).Netflix Originals today feels like the new straight-to-DVD release bin and has the same stigma too."
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",I think we're still getting the high quality stuff at roughly the same pace but they're releasing so much they're having to fill in around it with lower quality content which is making the good stuff much harder to find. I think they have the widest range in quality of any content provider out there. Some of their stuff is excellent and some is horrifyingly bad.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Are all these threads just Netflix bitchfests? 
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","Can’t wait to not watch more bad Netflix originals. I swear if some of these shows were in cable or networks, they’d be laughingstocks. "
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",You have to start somewhere. HBO put out a lot of bad to mediocre content before it got its reputation for “prestige” shows.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",It's almost like some shows are hits and some shows flop!
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","I can't imagine Netflix originals are any worse than the SyFy channel's original movies.- Sharknado, Aztec Rex,  Stonehenge Apocalypse, Bigfoot Maximum, Piranhaconda, Dinocroc Vs.

Netflix brass noted the ""Bright"" movie performed very well across the globe in the hundreds of markets where the streaming service was available, though declined per usual to share specific audience metrics.  “Most of the critical reviews you read are English language, just U.S.,” Hastings added.They are even making a sequel to Bright!

"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",the one real substantial complaint i have with the Netflix catalog is it's tone. it tends too much towards serious heavy dramas. that sort of thing becomes a bit dreary after a while. yes they have comedies but not that many . i find most of the lighter material to be geared directly towards children. sometimes i just need something to watch i don't have to think about.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",I’m just going to put this on repeat. There is no reason on this earth why the entire movie catalog of the United States isn’t available to watch and/or rent. I would happily pay 1-2 dollars to rent old movies if I knew I could quickly and legally access them.   
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","Which would be great, if most of those series weren't dismal failures like the new Lost In Space. Content will come back when the Warner/Disney/Paramount ventures fail. With studio streaming you're paying for access to a fixed pool of content: once you watch that content, the service is a waste of money and you'll soon cut it from your budget.A service like netflix (in principle) gives you a smorgasbord of studio offerings and hopefully some thoughtful curation of well-defined genres. Original series can be fun, but frankly most of them are simply multicultural remakes of what was broadcast in the 70s. People will drop Netflix in droves if that's the shape of things to come.    "
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","Can someone explain to me why Netflix no longer has some original content that it produced?  I am specifically thinking of Zack Galifinakis’s Live at the Purple Onion. I thought the idea was to keep growing their own catalog, but now I’m realizing older stuff isn’t there. "
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Netflix didn't produce that show it was just produced *for them* and they were a distributor.  Slight but important difference.According to Wiki.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",Yay twice as much crap. Someone needs to explain to them the concept of quality of quantity
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",How about invest in more quality over filler.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says",I would rather them just get some halfway decent horror films. Both companies have some very good original series but shifting the balance too far towards original content at the expense of the major studio films that netflix built its brand on will turn off a lot of the customer base. Amazon has more room to work here because they didn't build their brand as much on films.
"Netflix and Amazon Set to Nearly Double Originals Catalog, Study Says","most all of netflix originals are complete garbage, I think they're actually hurting their rep with their policy of making quantity rather then quality shows"
FCC: Local Franchise Authorities Can't Regulate Broadband,">  the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals last year found that the FCC could not use its mixed-use rule to bar LFAs from requiring franchisees to provide non-cable services, because that would appear to prevent LFAs from regulating institutional networksWould be nice if the Executive Branch stopped ignoring ruling from the Judicial Branch."

Pluto TV Just Announced 8 New Channels - Cord Cutters News,This is my biggest complaint for pluto tv. The ads are technically no more frequent than regular tv but the fact that they recycle the same ones so much makes them feel way longer. There are cases where it plays the same ad twice in a row.

How Netflix and Disney are fighting for the future of streaming: Kids,"I mean, if cable could support several kids channels, it's only natural that there'd be a ton of competition in the category on streaming as well. Especially when kids get hooked on something and want to watch it on repeat for months on end. Parents will probably get at least one streaming service for their kids, whether it be dedicated to kids or is something more general like Netflix."

What do you want to know? 1/XX,"I would love to hear about the more ""subjective"" experience pieces, in general but especially with the DVR. I've only subscribed to Hulu Live (+ Netflix and Prime Video) but the DVR is the thing that struck me as the most irritating.* Cannot (at least on Android) start watching an in-progress recording from the beginning, making it difficult to jump into an in-progress game* DVR set to ""all new episodes"" will also record episodes that are available on demand. I understand why they do this, but it's very difficult to tell what's going to be available on demand the next day and what's not."

What do you want to know? 1/XX,"To be honest, I’m not a big DVR user. I don’t know if I’m missing out or what but if I want to watch something I missed, I’d rather just watch it on demand and deal with the commercials. Most of the shows I watch are available on demand. I used to record football and soccer games all the time but realized that I never went back and watched them.I will be sure to use it to at least be able to speak to the ease of use and features, though.I will tell you this regarding Hulu Live; when I set up my account it asked me for favorite channels/shows/sports teams. I noticed that when I picked the Texans, it automatically started recording the football game last Sunday. Whenever I would close the app and re-open (iOS), it would take me straight to the game and start from the beginning too.I just jumped to live, but it’s an observation."

This is excellent for college football or MLS when there’s multiple games at once. I do notice like a one/two second buffering time for Hulu - negligible for me. It’s only when I change to a different channel. I’ve never had buffering issues mid-stream."

id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"Especially since Hollywood bundles everything.  For example Comcast, Cox, etc cannot buy just Disney Channel........ they are also forced to buy Disney XD, Freeform, ABC family, ESPN 1/2/3,  et cetera.- Other bundled channels are Discovery Networks, NBC networks, and FOX networks.  The cable company has to buy ~10 channels at once, not just one."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"There is no incentive for them to do that.It takes money to pay for the licensing, the equipment, the repairs, the customer support..etc, etcThey aren't going to give it away."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"That opportunity was lost when streaming bundlers like SlingTV came along and cordcutters embraced them. Some of us pointed out cordcutters were trading one master for another, but most people didn't care because these new streaming channel bundles were smaller and cost less than the old coax channel bundles.I will not be surprised if streaming bundles get bigger in the future instead of smaller."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"its the content providers, not sling.  Its not like ESPN is a stand alone company.  They are wrapped in the Disney family, so you have to buy a whole package of channels to get ESPN.  The same goes for every other channel."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,">I will not be surprised if streaming bundles get bigger in the future instead of smaller.And then someone will come along again to offer smaller cheaper bundles and people will jump on those because without contacts these companies aren't ""our master.""  If one isn't meeting our needs its very easy to jump to another one or cancel all together when there is nothing you need on (for example no new shows in the summer or non football season).In the beginning the cordcutting market was never going to be big enough to get companies to change how they license their channels, let alone the contracts already in place.  Saying otherwise is just wishful thinking.  Besides, paying for only the channels you would would be more expensive than options like sling anyway once you got past 5 or 6 channels."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,What channels?
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"The very idea of channels is dying. It's being replaced by streaming services.Someday, when you talk about channels, your kids will look at you like you look at your parents when they talk about land-line phones."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"Closest I've seen is Charter/Spectrum's ""Choice"" plan which gives you broadcasts + 10 channels of your choosing for $30ish, but you have to use them for Internet to get it & no DVR unless you rent one of theirs or get something with a cable card."
id much rather a service that did charge by the channel!,"I might actually switch to this once my Dtvn promo expires. I ready have a HDHR/Plex setup for DVR, I can get most channels that I need through Choice. "

In response the National Association of Broadcasters cited Kagan data that shows the pace of retrans increases have slowed significantly overall in the past several years from about 65% in 2010 to 10% in 2018.Another advantage of using antennas: Don't have to pay that fee.
ACA Members Believe Retrans Fees Will Rise 88% by 2020,"If the ACA doesn't like the price it pays for TV service it can stop paying. Stop bellyaching already.The recent HuluTV carve out of Sinclair stations with CBS, where CBS provides its network content circumventing the local affiliate, may become a new normal for network players.

Question about Data Caps,"3-4 GB per hour is a good rule of thumb for HD streaming. If ALL of your data usage was streaming, you’d get about 300 hours with 1TB. That’s roughly 10 hours per day. Based upon your comments, it doesn’t sound like you’ll go over that. Data usage is a bigger issue for families that might be streaming to 2 or 3 devices at a time, as well as those who leave it on all day or night for background noise. "
Question about Data Caps,As long as they aren't watching 4K video 3 GB would be on the high end.
Question about Data Caps,"Probably not, i have the same cap and as a family of three we use anywhere from 700 to 950gb a month. I would also say we are fairly heavy users. As long as your not streaming everything in 4k."
Question about Data Caps,nice. I would be streaming almost nothing in 4k
Question about Data Caps,\*You\* will not go over being that you are living alone. My parents go every single month and I did too until I made my local channels antenna. The data cap is insanely low and of course that is done on purpose. 
Question about Data Caps,"As a single person who uses ~2TB a month, you aren't *that* heavy of users!"
Question about Data Caps,You’re*
Question about Data Caps,For your situation living alone probably not.  As a couple that streams everything in HD it's quite difficult to stay under.  Makes me cringe everytime I see Comcast say 99% of users stay under the cap  I know more people that go over than stay under
Question about Data Caps,"> Comcast say 99% of users stay under the capYes, but it's only 99% only when including (a) customers using cable only; (b) people who aren't actually using Comcast; and (c) all the dead people."
Question about Data Caps,interesting because I posted something similar in r/gaming because I play games online and they all seem to say I should stay way under. A lot of replies are about people in homes with 4 people and they say they never go over 
Question about Data Caps,Comcast isn't making numbers up. You're anecdotal experience is not proof.
Question about Data Caps,"Yea you’re probably fine. I have a household of 7 people. Multiple Apple TVs, ps4s and computers  online at the same time and we’ve only gonna over once. And that was when I was downloading lots of files. We average about 750gb to 950gb per month. We only watch tv using the internet. :) "
Question about Data Caps,"You've got nothing to worry about. My fiancee and I only go through 250~300 GB a month and that's with Vue, Netflix, or Youtube running for hours daily. "
Question about Data Caps,"I wouldn't worry about it. Sounds like I am very similar usage wise to you: I live alone, have a streaming service for TV (DirectvNow) but most of my use is for sports, no 4K streaming, no big downloads, no online gaming, basic internet browsing on my phone when watching TV. I've never been close to hitting my cap -- I'm usually around 200-300GB per month."
Question about Data Caps,I have 3 people in my household and routinely go over 1TB. I don't feel like I am a 1 percenter either. 
Question about Data Caps,Same here!
Question about Data Caps,"I too have comcast for internet and use DirecTVNOW for tv (we've had it for about 5 months now). Its my wife and I in our household, both use music streaming services and are on our phones/laptop quite a bit for work and life with the tv on in the background, as well as Netflix or digital download rentals. I have yet to go over the data cap that comcast puts on their internet. closest I came was in July when I hit 620gb"
Question about Data Caps,"I went to internet only back in March and stream Youtube, YTTV for sports, and a little gaming - not much. Pretty much have the TV on from 6 or 7 until 11 watching baseball or whatever. My usage went from around 4-500GB a month to about 800ish. Before I cut the cord I still streamed baseball pretty regularly still but hopefully will give you an idea of what to expect."
Question about Data Caps,how is YTTV for sports? whats your speed in terms of MBS?
Question about Data Caps,Comcast has a fee and they will waive the cap.Also where I live if you get their Gigabit service there's no cap.
Question about Data Caps,how much is gigabit where you live?
Question about Data Caps,"Last month I got Comcast Internet only with the cap.  There's 2 of us watching TV/Streaming, and we average about 150 a week so far."
Question about Data Caps,"Do all Comcast XFINITY users have data caps? I have 150 mbps plan, have I just not hit the cap?edit: figured out how to check: https://dataplan.xfinity.com/ no data cap in my area woooo (for now)"
Question about Data Caps,"You shouldn’t have a issue. It’s just my wife and myself in the house, she doesn’t work so tv is playing all day and night while I’m at work. Have 2 Nvidia Shields, 3 computers, 2 iPhones, 8 wireless switches, 2 google minis and we are a internet only household. I average 600gigs a month. You should be fine. "
Question about Data Caps,"Does Comcast have an unlimited data cap plan? I have to pay extra, but mine went from 600 GB to unlimited for an extra $20. "
Question about Data Caps,"Depending on where OP is located, the price may vary. Over here in Washington State, you have to pay an extra $50 a month for unlimited.Edit: Which I am already paying $60 for 200/10. Back in Texas I was paying $80 for 400/10  w/Unlimited, I miss Texas."
Question about Data Caps,"We had the same concern before we cut the cord. After about 6 months, we average ~450 GB every month. Family of three, tv is on from the moment we get home until we go to bed, no 4k. "
Question about Data Caps,"Family of 5 here who stream everything including games, sports and some 4K content. We average 700-800 GB/mo.  "
Question about Data Caps,just the wife and i 1tb cap with cox. use ps vue netflix ps4 regular browsing etc have never even come close to going over. no 4k tv’s just hd though
Question about Data Caps,depends on your playback rate and video quality..anywhere from about 130 hours a month at 4K to 900 hours a month for 480p
Question about Data Caps,"I seriously hate comcast.  Moved from a google fiber zone to a comcast zone and was appalled to learn that there is a 1 TB cap.  I don't really use that much internet myself, but I live in a house with four other guys to save money.  Split evenly, we only get 200 GB per person.  It's freaking stupid that Comcast is trying to make an unlimited resource into a finite resource.  It's as absurd as saying that you can only listen to a certain number of hours of the radio before incurring a fee."
Question about Data Caps,"In our home, I have 2 constantly streaming kids, 3 streaming iphones and all TV is streamed with appleTV. We just go over 1TB every month."
Locast comes to Boston-local channels free,I can't find much info on this. Have you used this? Just cut the cord and if this works well that'd be awesome. Have yet to buy a roku box but if it's as good as Im hoping I'll pick one up asap.
Locast comes to Boston-local channels free,"Yes,we used it last night and today.perfect.We cut the cord 3 years ago and use many legal and not so much other things that are free.local channels that stream 24/7 were hard without an antenna,until this.We use firetv and roku by using 2 Hdmi's on the tvs.I prefer firetv but Locast appears to only be in roku.you don't need anything fancy.the cheap rocky sticks are fine.yay,free tv!"
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,5g service from Comcast probably. 
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,*with 1TB data cap
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"Spectrum has already started their mobile service, I'm sure that Comcast will do the same.  Even if it's as an MVNO, they'll still start encroaching into the wireless market.  And of course they'll also loosen the reins a bit on their cable ISP as well.And to be honest, Comcast is big enough that they certainly could make a bid to acquire some smaller carriers as well."
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"When Google Fiber was moving into Salt Lake City, Comcast responded by providing 1 gigabit service.  I expect they will do the same if 5G arrives in your city.That's the benefit of free market competition... it forces a company to stop being lazy & improve itself (or lose customers and die)."
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"They will lose service in droves.They'll do EVERYTHING except improve their product, speed, and service in response. They'll try to lobby to restrict 5g (they already are), they'll use monopolistic practices (cancellation fees, anti-competition behavior, etc), and they'll complain that it isn't fair.The day that it's available, I'll switch away from Comcast. I don't care if it's more expensive, slower speeds, or has a data cap. "
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,I am doubtful unmetered wireless will be offered. 
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"Verizon started taking orders for fixed 5g wireless in the Houston area yesterday with no caps.  300mb to 1gig speeds, $50/mo for existing Verizon wireless customers, $70 a month for anyone else - completely inclusive of taxes, fees etc including equipment - the 1st 3 months will be free with a new Apple tv.I'd say that's a pretty strong indication that unmetered high speed wireless is being offered."
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,I live in an area that used to be exclusively Comcast.  Then FiOS moved in to compete.  Both offer no cap and no speed reduction.  You can be sure Comcast offers this purely because of the competition. 
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,What is the bad news? Even 70 for 300meg is fantastic 
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,It won't. The cable companies will just have a nice chat with their good pal Ajit Pai and Ajit will destroy the progress of 5G before they ruin the cable company's monopoly.
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,The big dig against Ajit Pai is that he was a Verizon employee.  That doesn't really fit your theory.
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"Any mention of Comcast makes me irrationally angry. Well, perhaps it is quite rational. Comcast sucks!"
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,"Probably nothing. Both services will be very expensive, go down a lot and raise rates every year. We have both Comcast and Verizon where I am and they don't care to compete at all unless you're a new customer. "
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,I have been wondering why the predictions that 5G will be cheap. Why would they do that? I think they only would where there is competition from other 5G providers. I hope to be proven wrong though.
What do you think will happen when unlimited 5G reaches Comcast-only areas?,Nah nah nah... nah nah nah nah... hey hey hey... Goooooood bye!

TV Antennas Making Comeback As More Americans Cut The Cord...,> Mr. Free HDTV ManBrilliant name for his business.
TV Antennas Making Comeback As More Americans Cut The Cord...,Saw a couple of YouTube videos today; a guy in Canada and a guy in Georgia making their own TV Antennas.The GA  guy said he makes $1000. a week for making & installing homemade antennas; he says he only works 2-3 days.
TV Antennas Making Comeback As More Americans Cut The Cord...,"$350 to $450 seems somewhat high for a basic antenna install, more so if it doesn't include the antenna itself.   But if they are doing thousands and thousands of them as stated, they must be pricing it appropriately from the market's standpoint."
TV Antennas Making Comeback As More Americans Cut The Cord...,"They're roof and attic antenna, so they're probably larger and more expensive.  Add on that they're likely doing the actual install, assuming it, and making sure everything is wired properly, and I can see the price being reasonable.  It is probably about double the cost of hardware which is a pretty normal pricing."

"Frustration with the ""app"" problem","The Apple TV 4K has pretty much every streaming app you need, often offering the best experience for a wide range of services (especially live TV). The limited app stores of smart TVs and consoles can be frustrating. "
"Frustration with the ""app"" problem","It's up to the services themselves to make the apps, not the platform. So the real question is, how can you convince a service to put the time and money into making and supporting another app for another platform? Difficulty is variable and relative, short-term and long-term costs and returns are more important. Sometimes the platform will pay the service to add support, but that's rare and usually only occurs with the most popular services like Netflix.If you really want a Smart TV with a lot of existing apps, get a Roku TV, Fire TV, or Android TV which are existing well supported platforms. Other than that, Samsung and LG have okay app selections."

How Streaming Services Like Showtime and Hulu Combat Subscriber Churn,"If they're really having a problem with it, why not offer discounted yearly rates? I have a couple services that I don't mind paying a year upfront (without a contract) as long as I'm getting a better deal. I think for people who do ""churn,"" they still have some services they will subscribe to for a full year."
How Streaming Services Like Showtime and Hulu Combat Subscriber Churn,"Showtime offers a discounted yearly rate as does STARZ, Sundance Now and a few others. Hulu and Netflix don’t offer yearly subscriptions AFAIK. "
How Streaming Services Like Showtime and Hulu Combat Subscriber Churn,"Discounted yearly rates aren’t too popular because when it comes time to renew, increasing the yearly rate by 10-15 dollars looks worse than increasing a dollar a month. "
How Streaming Services Like Showtime and Hulu Combat Subscriber Churn,"I don't even pay for Netflix, Hulu or Amazon! Just do a one month free trial for one service, they will offer an extra month when you got to cancel and then you move on to the next service. 2 months Amazon, 2 months Hulu, 2 months Netflix and then repeat. I've been doing this for the last 2 YEARS!"
How Streaming Services Like Showtime and Hulu Combat Subscriber Churn,"At least for myself, the ""churn"" helps with keeping the costs down.  We subscribe to a few services each year (ex: HBO / Starz / CBS All-Access), watch what we are interested in, and then cancel.  There are three we do not cancel (Netflix / Amazon / Hulu) for various reasons.  But, the rest we subscribe and cancel when there is content we are interested in.  "

Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,You could get a used (but like new) Tablo for half as much.
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,"I got my Tablo used from Amazon, works great and I got the lifetime guide data this year so no more payments."
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,My big issue is limited device support and you can't add external storage. Past that looks good. 
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,"Not being able to use the USB 3.0 port for storage kills it for me, I have 2TB attached to my Tablo.  If the drive dies I got to Costco and buy another one."
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,"My primary concerns with it are the limited device support and I think lack of storage expansion. I've had platform locked devices/services in the past, and it often burns me in the future. And with no way to expand storage or archive recordings elsewhere(both things I can do on a Tablo) it's value further drops in my eyes."
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,"Your locked into the Amazon echo system.  Hdhomerun, Tablo and Airtv all have similar offerings available on multiple eco systems."
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,I already have a server running plex with DVR and I considered it as I already use many fire tv devices spread out in my household.The biggest issue holding me back is commercials. Right now everything I record in plex is stripped of commercials and recompiled to a better streaming format. I fear that if I switch over to the Recast I'll be dealing with commercials and huge TS files all over again.
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,Not having to pay for guide data is a big plus but then you are limited to 1TB and you can not currently add more storage via the USB 3.0 port on the back.
Thinking about getting the Amazon Recast.,"I have a couple of questions about the DVR functions. I have two OTA DVRs, both Channel Master, the DVR+ (which is nearly perfect) and the Stream+. But both are single-TV devices. Anyway, the Stream+ is also running Android TV (I think Amazon is forking a version of Android for their Recast device), and Live Channels, and the deficiencies in that device are:1. Guide data only goes out 48 hours - we are promised 14 days by year end.2. You can't start watching a program that is being recorded in ""delayed mode""; we often start watching a program being recorded about 20 minutes in so we can skip the commercials.The rest of the DVR functions are fine, and I suspect Amazon's version will be very similar to Google's Live Channels. I also have a HD Homerun which is the same as the Recast (a network OTA streamer) but also has the ability to stream Silicon Dust's ""Premium TV"" skinny bundle. And, it can record those streamed cable channels on it's $35 a year DVR. The Fire TV devices support the HD Homerun through its app. The disadvantages are that you need some kind of network storage or media server to store the recordings on, and the DVR user interface is ... odd. But at $35 a year for a 14 day guide (such that it is a guide), it's cheap enough for me."
Roku debuts new Premiere and Premiere Plus 4K HDR devices starting at $40,"The Roku Premiere doesn't support 802.11ac, which makes no sense to me as a 4K streaming device. If you're going to stream 4K and you have a 802.11ac router, you'll want the 802.11ac support.Edit: It looks like the Roku Premiere does support 802.11n on both 2.4GHz *and* 5GHz, based on their [comparison](https://www.roku.com/products/compare#sku=3920R) page (see the checkbox for dual-band MIMO support).

Most of the differences between the devices are down to technical specs that the average consumer doesn't understand, kind of counter to the Roku simplicity.Though I guess this time things aren't too bad, since the devices can be roughly divided into:* Cheap Boxes: * Non-4K ($30)     * Optional: Analog A/V Out ($35) * 4K ($40)     * Optional: Wireless Remote with Voice Search ($50)* Streaming Sticks: * Non-4K ($50) * 4K ($70)* Premium box with Ethernet and USB, plus Headphone jack remote ($100)"

If you're not a hockey and/or Knicks fan, Vue, YouTube TV, and Hulu with Live TV are great choices. Remember, you can use whichever to log into many tv network apps for live and on demand content as well.

And all your local network stations. Someone else said Directv Now is unreliable, but it's been great for me. I've had it since March and have had very few issues. Watched college football all day on Saturday with no buffering. I've had the picture freeze a few times recently, but changing the channel and back fixes it. I get a better picture than I did with cable (Comcast) and save a ton of money. One great thing about Directv Now is that premium channels like HBO and Showtime are only $5/month, compared to $15 on other services. If you're an AT&T Wireless customer with one of their unlimited plans, you can get $15 off per month on Directv Now and free HBO, so a total savings of $20 per month. That alone makes it worth it to me. I think YouTube TV has a better interface, but Directv Now is the cheapest by far because of a phone plan I'd have regardless. "

Poor reception to primary channels only,Delete the powerline amp and try again.  Maybe the  tuner is being overpowered
Poor reception to primary channels only,Powerline networking adapters
Poor reception to primary channels only,>I'm puzzled why signal is spotty on primary channels but perfectly fine on the secondaries?If the streams are all on the same transmitter the reception should be the same. At the point of separation it is all digital.The main signal is usually in HD with the rest in SD. So a significantly higher bit rate. You might want to check your networking.Does the failure show on the HDHomerun diagnostic program/app?Power line networking is a known source of severe interference but I had the impression it was not that bad at TV frequencies. Still something you could look at as faster data transfer on a HD channel could in theory cause more interference.
Poor reception to primary channels only,Looks like it might be as simple as a failing network cable.  Swapped it out and so far signal is much improved.  What's the old saying .. 'your network is only as good as its weakest point.'I will check the diagnostics later.
Poor reception to primary channels only,See my latest post .. you were correct suggesting the network issues.
Poor reception to primary channels only,"The Dual is bit old but there are firmware updates for tuning, re-scan required.  Nothing wrong with your antenna choice but to use 2 of them typically would be pointed in perpendicular directions.   The antenna receives signal from the rearward direction almost as well as from the front."
Poor reception to primary channels only,"Thanks, I found the solution - the powerline network adapters were a total failure.  Diagnostics indicated a ton of packet losses.  I used 2 different brands.Turns out the house had coax I was able to fish out, allowing me to relocate the HDHR downstairs next to the router thus circumventing powerline.  Rock solid now.   I guess I'm just surprised how poorly powerline performed considering how it works for many.  Guess each situation is different.Edit:  Silicon Dust told me the primaries were affected the most since it used the most bandwidth.  Makes sense."

Either menu or play/pause should clear everything and take you back to what's currently playing, instead menu exits the app altogether.\- Since each show must be individually recorded which is an epic, just stupendous oversight in it's own, you have to search for the shows you want to record, then go the show in the search results, aaaaaaand the record option does nothing"

I have actually found myself using prime music all the time lately since they’ve started adding personalized stations at some point like pandora. It also has some movies that weren’t available elsewhere that I wanted to watch. All in all I think prime is very much worth the $10 a month. Netflix is a binge service imo and just something you sub to when there is something on it you wanna watch, sub and watch everything before cancelling again after a month or two. I subscribe to DTVN but it’s only for the rest of my household. I never ever turn it on and the only use I personally get out of it would be the $5 hbo when I subscribe to it while there are some movies I want to see on it. "
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"I went through this same thought process a few months ago because I felt like I was spending an outrageous amount of money on this stuff. I could afford it, but I decided I didn't want to anymore. I had Amazon Prime, Netflix and DTV Now with HBO. I don't watch any live sports though, so I think that makes things easier for me. Getting NBA games probably changes the equation dramatically if there's no other way to view them.DTV Now and HBO got cut. I listed out all the shows I was watching and looking up the dates for the next season. Basically all of them have been pushed to 2019 - 2020, so no real reason to have live TV this fall for me. I only have a handful of shows currently airing that I'd actually purchase outright, so I'll save significantly with season passes ($20 - $40 each x 6) over monthly service ($45 x 12). What I don't spend on season passes I'll spend on buying back seasons or movies. I'm tired of hunting down stuff between streaming services or finding out there's suddenly no way to watch it.I don't keep Prime for the TV, mostly just the music and free shipping. I'm paid up through April and I use the other benefits year round, so this will stay.I couldn't stomach paying for Hulu without ads *and* Netflix at the same time since I'm trying to reduce streaming expenses, so I'm alternating subscriptions monthly. This is about as much as I'm willing to bother with. (TV is supposed to be relaxing and easy, right?)I also fixed my OTA situation with a Tablo. If I had known about the Fire stuff coming, I might've gone that route. DTV Now only had 1 mislabeled local I didn't care about but I'd been using them for credentials to stream ABC/NBC/CBS shows.It's been about a month since I put this plan in action. So far I've spent more time watching shows deliberately vs. watching whatever happened to be on because I couldn't decide what thing I DVR'd or had queued that I wanted to watch. And it is refreshing to not have to sit through ads or try to FF a cloud DVR and hope it doesn't shit the bed."
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"This is sort of where my thought process is coming from.The challenge for me is the NBA but it's not like I'll die not watching regular season games. I suppose I can simply get sling when it's playoff time for the ESPN and tnt games. But at the same time the NBA is my favorite league, it's the best spectacle and best game.Even just cutting DTVnow and getting HBO separate would get me ahead. 30 a month not spent on dtvnow can go towards one a la carte season of whatever specific show I like, but I wouldn't even necessarily buy that many seasons since there's so much quality stuff on Netflix and Amazon and HBO as is. Plus I tend to play video games more than TV generally, and because of various sales and giveaways I have a bunch of games to play."
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"You could do a rotation based on what you watch.

At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"Prime has other benefits like shipping and exclusive deals and while their pricing isn't as low as it used to be it still saves me trips to the store for items not needed immediately. As fas the Directvnow check the channels you actually watch and see if any other services like Vue, yttv, etc.. offer them cheaper. I think HBO is the largest waste of money to keep regularly. You can sign up for $15 and watch a bunch of stuff in a month then cancel. "
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"Basically the answer is if/when you don’t feel like you’re getting a value out of one or more of the services.

Having a bill of 70$ plus your bill for internet is in the territory of a satellite bill. Most people are switching to streaming bc they dont watch ALOT of TV. Maybe play around with what you have? One month have Netflix, the next do hbo.Have you looked into espn+? Also I havent looked at the prices of directtv now but sling is around 25$ I tell customers that if they keep their bill under 120 for internet and TV they are doing good. After 120, you're either paying too much or grandfathered into a bad bill/speed.Also get a OTA antenna!!! It helps!!"
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,>$71 a month. I get most of my TV shows by renting the DVD or Bluray season set.  That is waaaaay cheaper than ~850/year.
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"Strictly due to my frugal bones, I only keep one service. I gave up NF for Amazon Prime. There are too many other monthly expenses to pay in life. But we don't watch a lot of video, so it's more than enough. Since Prime is for annual sub, no room for NF. Might add Shudder TV, but that's about $35 annually, I believe..."
At what point does cutting a streaming service make sense?,"You know what the nice thing about most streaming services is? Binge Watching.I used to subscribe to Netflix consistently, ever since they first offered streaming. Recently I figured out that I just don't watch it as much as I used to. Yes, I watch certain shows, but I tend to binge-watch them, and then I leave Netflix alone for a month or two before going back and watching another in the same manner.So I canceled them. Every few months I go back if there's a new show, and I binge-watch it over the course of a few days. When I've exhausted their collection of shows or movies that I'm interested in, I cancel again and save myself another few months of subscription fees. I do the same with HBO Now, but for currently-airing shows. When GoT or Westworld are on new seasons, I subscribe and watch for the couple months they're active. Then when the season is over I cancel and wait for the new seasons. Amazon Prime Video is different, since it's tied to my Prime account and I use that for other things. That stays constant. Hulu I'll subscribe to once a year, maybe, if there's something good and exclusive. So far, I'm not impressed enough to stay past the 1 month trial. I do not watch sports, so I don't bother with any ""live"" TV packages. They're annoying and not worth it to me. I hate commercials, and I hate viewing by appointment. Frankly, I think you sports fans are crazy for trying to cut the cord, because they have you by the balls and you end up paying a lot extra for the TV-via-Internet packages just to get your live sports events, and then you STILL have to watch a thousand commercials. But it's your choice. I just think they're taking advantage of your addiction to sports, is all. It's a lot cheaper and simpler if you just stop giving a damn about sports. Try it. You may find, after a few weeks of skipping it, that it wasn't as important to you as you previously thought it was. "
HDHomeRun Prime video quality not as good as it should be?,are you watching over wifi?    
HDHomeRun Prime video quality not as good as it should be?,"The Prime doesn't transcode, so the only way this is possible is you have the quality set lower on playback and plex is transcoding to a lower quality stream.Or your cable company is now just compressing the hell out of the channels to squeeze in more stuff. The HDHR just grabs the stream as its sent. Its not going to selectively drop detail in the picture."
HDHomeRun Prime video quality not as good as it should be?,"One issue I've run into is interlacing on 1080i channels.  Most set-top boxes deinterlace the signal for you, whereas if I'm watching 1080i content directly from the HDHR on, say, my FireTV (which displays at 1080p) there's no deinterlacing happening and it looks really terrible.  Of course, this doesn't apply for 720p content."
HDHomeRun Prime video quality not as good as it should be?,Plex is probably transcoding and that is the loss in quality. The prime gets the exact same video as a cable box due to the cable card.
Help: problem w/ CBS All Access through Amazon Prime,"Justwatch.com doesn't list season 6 of Elementary with any streaming service except as a purchase. (Amazon would be one of those options). Hulu has rights to the first five seasons of Elementary. (See Justwatch.com and Hulu). My guess is that season 6 will soon land on Hulu.I looked on cbs.com and unlike NCIS, I can't not find any full episodes for Elementary - just clips and news stories. The tab for full episodes is missing. This usually means they no longer have the rights to the show. (Like Big Bang Theory and a few others, I don't think they produce it in house.)Same problem for Young Sheldon except it says the new season is premieres in less than a week. For shows that CBS licenses and does not produce, this happens in the week or or two leading up to a new season. They may only have a current season or five or six episodes - depending on what rights were granted to them. This looks like the same pattern as Big Bang Theory."

cable running advice,"If the signals are reasonably strong then passive splitters should work. Try to get one that claims an actual loss spec. Unfortunately counterfeit splitters are a thing but that seems to be the best you can do.>...if we start ""streaming"" local channels may hit the data cap the ISP has and also during bad storms here in midwest the internet can go out and thats when i really need the OTA for the weather...Things like the Tablo use the local network for the actual streaming. The only thing they use the internet for is the guide data."
cable running advice,Thanks for the splitter info.  And not sure why I was thinking the tablo would go against data cap. Feel like an idiot now and may have to reevaluate that. 
"Fire TV Recast looks awesome, but I have a Shield TV. What should I get instead?","Only bad thing with Tablo is there's a subscription fee to get more than 24 hours worth of guide data. I switched to an HD Homerun w/ Plex as my DVR and haven't looked back. I already have the lifetime Plex pass and use it for movies and other tv shows already, so it was an easy switch. I like that all my media is in one place now instead of spread across multiple apps.If you're starting from scratch it's definitely a bigger investment, although you can always use the Shield as a Plex server (your only purchase would be the HD Homerun then, anywhere between $100-150, and Plex pass if you don't have it already)."
"Fire TV Recast looks awesome, but I have a Shield TV. What should I get instead?","Cool, I have a lifetime Plex pass too. Thanks for the heads up, I definitely don't want a subscription for Tablo. I've just never heard of the HD Homerun, so I'll look into this.I like the idea of a standalone device as opposed to a tuner that'd plug right into the Shield TV. My antenna is tucked behind the TV where it doesn't pick up as many channels as it could. I bet I could find a better signal elsewhere in the apartment and keep my TV where I like it, and still keep the cords looking tidy."

Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,"No fees with streaming services, some jurisdictions charge tax but it will show you your price before you click submit. "
Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,"So some fees to keep in mind they aren’t telling you about are: broadcast fee ($8), regional sports fee ($6.50), franchise fee ($5), and HD tech fee ($10) if it’s not included for the first year. Then you’ll need to calculate the DVR costs if they don’t provide one included, plus the other outlets or TVs you’ll want your service on. I believe each extra outlet is like $5 or $10 a month. If you can find a streaming service that covers all or most of your bases, I’d suggest you go with them. For me, I’m missing out on HBO, PAC 12, and NFL Network/RedZone with YouTube TV, but I wouldn’t go back all things considered. Not having to pay those fees, to me, is so freeing and invigorating that it’s worth sacrificing a few channels. The major caveat here, though, is to know what the internet-only plans are going to be. If Comcast offers you $80 for the package you described, but $65 for Internet only, it might not make sense to cut the cord depending on what channels you need.  For me, I went from $145 a month for one TV to $55 a month for the same internet speed and no TV. "
Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,"You forgot to mention Taxes!We had Comcast's ""double play""....TV & Internet; the price was $99.99 mo.Our bill was $128.67.Jus' sayin."

Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,"First rule. Never believe a damn thing comcast says.  I had a package that just went up in price constantly, and they kept removing channels from. Oh yeah I had a 2 year agreement.... but that agreement is only on you to pay not their agreement not to jack the bill up and remove channels. Even if it's the same price to cut the cord. Do it. Because that cable price won't be the same long."
Comcast promo offers VS cord cutting,Just switched. They offered $75 for 60mbps or local channels and 100mbps for $59.99. So that made it easy for me to choose sling to cover my missing channels. By doing that I’m saving almost $40 a month. Hate that they are my only option for Internet.

Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,i bought a powered 1byone antenna (2018 model) and I get 40 channels. Previous antenna only got me 20.
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,This is what we bought. 
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"I need a smart amplifier that will amplify some signals but not others. This is because I live next to a local antenna, but also want to receive signals from farther away. If I turn on the amplify function, the local channels are overamplified and lose signal."
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,Get the biggest antenna you can based on the recommendations from TVfool or Antenna web and figure out how to put it outside or in an attic.  Antennas are a trial and error thing. Just because one works great for someone else doesn't mean it'll work for you. On my 2nd floor we get all the channels with an old cheap antenna but first floor and basement are pretty hard to get anything.
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"We are on a hill, in a depression part, so...we have trees and other stuff to deal with. We also have our projector for home theater in downstairs which is daylight basement. Anyway, we got a 50-mile range window antenna (hanging on suction cups on window). Ours is powered/amplified which help. Works fine, but we don't get tons of channels.I found that a lot of channels are available on the web, without the problems of an antenna (weather, trees, and other issues)."
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"Skip the antenna ; if you found channels you watch are on the web, go that route.  Antennas don't work for most."
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"Honestly, I use a paperclip.  Get all the local channels in HD plus two PBS stations."
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"I'm glad for you, but the paperclip didn't work for me."
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,How?
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,Is the hill blocking your TV signals?>...but it would still be pretty low compared to the surrounding topography.Are you on the side of a valley or something?You could go to a site like TVFool.com to see what it thinks but what are you going to do about it if it is pessimistic? You should probably blow $10 on the rabbit ears and just try it.
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"I am in the middle of the city, the neighborhood is just built on a hill.  I'll probably just have to experiment with some and hopefully be able to return them if they don't work.  "
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,">  I have my TVFool reportPlease share it, otherwise we have no idea if your TV signals are weak or strong.  In order to get any reception with my basement television I initially tried a Winegard Freevision but only got 1 station.  I then installed a CM4228 which gave me about 15 stations, and over 25 channels.   (I then put the Freevision on my second-floor TV, and it works great up there.)"
Indoor HDTV Antenna Suggestions,"I thought I attached it via reddit, weird... "
Finally did it!,"That’s what I did then went over my 1TB cap.  Looking at paying Comcast $50 more month to extend to unlimited I added antenna and Tablo and also ended up going back to DirecTV with a promo for $45 off per month + $450 combined in cash and a a final bill forgiveness.  That only lasts one year though, so I’ll be canceling again.At DTV’s full price it’s still cheaper to be on DTVN + $50 more to comcast if necessary."
Finally did it!,Yeah they jumped us back to 130 a month for one room. Just tired of it. That was with an AT&T discount. 
Finally did it!,Yeah they jumped us back to 130 a month for one room. Just tired of it. That was with an AT&T discount. 
Finally did it!,Congrats. Hopefully DTVN doesn’t sour you on the experience. Just remember there are no long term commitments and many other options.
Finally did it!,It seems to work well for me now. I had an issue with the sound but once that was sorted out I have loved it.   Free hbo and $15 off was hard to pass up. 
Finally did it!,Well it is working on my phone and Apple TV and since the sound issue initially it has ran flawlessly. Takes maybe 2 seconds to load a channel then no buffering.  If I don’t like it at least I’m not locked down anymore. 
Digital Antenna Question,"Antenna height tends to be the most important variable in OTA TV reception and a basement is negative height. So, yes, you could have problems.To get an idea of how tough the problem is you can use a online reception prediction site. Examples:* http://tvfool.com/index.php?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29* https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmapsYou can post a link to the results of the TV Fool report for more informed advice.You might as well score some cheap unamplified rabbit ears from a local discount store and try it. Rabbit ears are as likely to work as any indoor antenna and are better than many."
Which one looks better?,Amazon channels
Which one looks better?,Does the cbs all access app have bad quality?
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,"I highly doubt you would need both DirecTV Now and Philo. DTVN has pretty much all the channels, and is the most cable like experience of the OTT providers.What I usually recommend is making a list of the shows you watch. Decide which ones you have to see day 1, which you can wait until they hit streaming services, and which ones you really don't care if you actually ever see them.That should help you at least find a direction."
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,">We do watch news and some (recorded) prime time shows from CBS, NBC, ABC & Fox as well as History, National Geographic, Travel, Tru, ID and maybe HGTV/TLC. Would like the weather channel (hurricanes and Jim Cantore!).Do you know why you would need DirecTV Now **AND** Philo?  I think DTVN gets all those non-local channels.  Did you check their website to see if they offer your local channels already?  You may not even need an antenna.If you were to go with Hulu Live TV or Youtube TV you would want Philo to supplement the missing channels.  The exception would be The Weather Channel.  I think the only services that offer that are DTVN and FuboTV.>I don't even know if we can ff through the ads on DirectTV Now (or Philo, which I had never heard of until today).Philo does allow you to fast forward through commercials.  DTVN allows you to fast forward through commercials for programs that are recorded to your ""Cloud"" DVR already.The deal killer for us with DTVN is that you can't pause/FFW live TV that you're behind on.  For a while you couldn't even pause live TV for more than a minute or so since it would jump back to live.  Not sure if that's still the case.>I assume we'd still need a DVR?Each service has it's own DVR service built in.We cancelled DirecTV a month ago and replaced it with Hulu Live TV and Philo.  We're paying **half** of what our DirecTV bill was and couldn't be happier."
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,"Thank you.  I looked at Hulu, but may be judging them from the trial I did  years ago on their streaming.  Ads, ads, ads, and no way to avoid.Reviews on DTVN are so mixed it concerns me.  Black screens, etc.I really have to figure out what Philo is/does LOL"
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,"Check tvfool.com to see what channels you can get with an antenna. If you can get the networks you want then you could do what we did, get an antenna, a DVR, and a streaming device like a Roku to watch Netflix. After your initial cost, your monthly cost is going to be $15 to $30.TiVo makes the Roamio OTA DVR that records antenna TV and allows you to skip commercials.

Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,"Before signing up for one of the cable TV through the internet services, I would check how much of what you watch is available on Hulu (normal service, not live TV). Personally, I've found that just subscribing to their $11.99 ad free* tier, and then buying shows they don't have on Vudu (usually ~$20 each for current seasons, available day after airing with no commercials) is a lot cheaper than subscribing to any live TV service. Your local news station might have a Roku app or be available on the NewsON app. There is not currently any way to get the weather channel without a cable/online cable subscription. WeatherNation works pretty well for local weather though.*There's like 5 shows that still have ads on the ad free tier."
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,"call directv and ask for the retention department, many people have major success getting bills lowered."
Ugh - $130 monthly DirectTV bill with no premium channels :( - can you help?,Weather channel can be replaced by Weather Nation.  It's much better and completely free.  Just get a Roku or Fire TV.

Thank you!!","I can’t speak to NY sports but Comedy Central is owned by Viacom, HGTV by Discovery and TNT/TBS by WB/AT&T. Only major service that carries all of those is Directv Now. You can enter your zip on their website and see which Regional Sports Networks would be included. Unfortunately DTVN is on the low end in terms of reliability, DVR storage and app quality. Live streaming is good quality but watch your data cap if you have one. Silicon Dust recently started a streaming service that works with its HD HomeRun boxes. It has the 4 channels you listed but no RSNs. At least, not yet. EDIT: Sling may be an option too.  Always forget about them. When I last demoed about a year ago, both the image and app were poor quality. All services have free trials so sample for yourself. "

"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Look at Philo on Roku, it has what you want cheaper than anyone else"
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","> The channels I use most are AMC, TNT, Fox, NBC, HGTV, Food Network, SYFY, and FX/FXXI use Philo, and there's no TNT, Fox, NBC, SYFY, or FX/FXX, as OP is looking for."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Just to clarify, no locals on Philo so he'd need to use an ota antenna too (for Fox and NBC).I like Philo though. I highly recommend the service if the smaller selection of channels works for people."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",They all have free trials and while people can tell you their experence with thier location and thier connection with thier equipment none of it may apply to you your best bet is to try them all out
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Definitely do this. Luckily DTVN didn't have local CBS when I started free trial, right at the end they added it without any hoopla. Glad I was testing it."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Vue is worth it, 5 streams and the best DVR. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",Is the Vue’s DVR really better than YouTube TV’s?
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I really like parts of Vue's DVR, but I have had to stop watching a number of series because I was saving them, and on certain channels, it will only save the most recent 5 episodes, so if you were waiting, and it hits Episode 6, well you are shit out of luck. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",Did you consider YouTube TV?
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Right now, I seem to have narrowed it down between Vue and YTTV. It is disappointing that neither get Viacom channels, but what to do.&#x200B;The biggest differences I'm seeing is that with YTTV I lose Discovery, Animal Planet, HGTV, and more importantly Food Network and also I've read a lot of complaints that YTTV forces VOD, so you can't skip commercials for most stuff. I think I get the same locals with both except for CW, which I don't really watch anymore anyway.&#x200B;With those things in mind, it seems like Vue seems to fit what I want decidedly better than YTTV."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","One thing people need to realize is that cord cutting should not just be a new way of having old TV habits. I only watch certain things. I don't have TV on all day. I use the NFL app to watch football (phone only), I use Netflix, Hulu, and my dad uses HBO Now. The thing is, what do you need? What shows do you like? If you're one of those people that likes to have background noise, podcasts are great for that. Those are all free. Music streaming is another one.For me, I was a cc because I had all these channels and never watched most of them. I was tired of spending nearly 200 bucks just to watch Kitchen Nightmares and Mythbusters marathons. Also, less TV has helped my anxiety and depression. I don't know what your situation is, but that's how I do. Less is more and better."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I cut the cord about 10 years ago and I agree with you completely. One of the very best thing about cutting the cord is that it is a great chance to change bad habits like leaving the TV on all the time ""in the background."" I usually put music on in the house instead now. Only time I turn on the TV these days is to sit down and specifically watch something. No more channel surfing, no more commercials, no more sitting down at a certain time to watching something live as it airs. The ""Live TV"" streaming services are completely unappealing because watching live TV with commercials is antiquated and weird and a waste of my time. It's very freeing to just leave all that behind. TV is mostly off these days. I still watch a lot of shows, but I watch them days, weeks, or full seasons later. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",Seriously.  The services asked about by OP seem to be more cable TV over IP and not so much cutting the cord.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I have Sling. NBC comes with it. Depends on if you choose Orange or Blue package. I recommend the free trials like someone else here suggested. It’s worth it. Good luck. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Well it depends on the market whether there’s abc, cbs, fox and nbc are available Here in the Tampa market. We get abc and I think fox "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","As others have said, try the trials. I have used Vue, DTN, and Hulu Live. Vue was the most expensive, and didn't give me a ton. DTN was buggy as hell. Now I  am using Hulu Live, watching the Pats game now. :) Too bad your channels don't align , it's been great. I love how it works seemlessly with the non live service.Good luck! "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",Are games geolocked?
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","The second I find out Hulu Live gets all my locals, I'm back in a second."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",When I had Vue it was very reliable and I was very happy with it at the time. I have since moved on to other streaming services due to price. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","From reading on these forums, apparently another option is Youtube TV. How does it compare to PSV?&#x200B;"
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I'm not familiar with psv, but the interface of  yttv is pretty good. Hulus interface is abysmal. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I switched from psv to yttv last month. I think everything is better with yttv except there are some channels that it doesn't have, but for $40/month I'll just buy the shows I missed on amazon or wait for them to go on netflix/hulu/prime. For $40 you're going to have a hard time getting everything you want. The cheapest option is PS Vue Access for $45+ tax, but you only get a 28 day dvr which in the end wasn't enough for me. Honestly just look at the different streaming services and do a free trial of the ones that have your channels. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Trials. That is the best way to determine which service works best. I would rotate them as each trial ends and begin a new one. That is a free month of TV right there. :)DirecTVNow has gotten a lot better. One less talked about perk of it is the discount on premium channel subscriptions. For example, HBO is only $5 per month.I have not had any issues with the DVR recently but TBH I don't use it a lot. I mostly catch shows on the on demand screen. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I am definitely going to use the 5/month HBO at some point, probably going to wait for Game of Thrones, otherwise I'll get addicted to it and never cancel"
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I really like vue. I use the DVR and on demand a lot. Fiance likes the sports channels add on.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","You should give it a month or two without live tv. It's a complete waste, you'll find PLENTY of other content to watch and won't be paying for ads. Just an opinion. They'll be happy to take your money later."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Sling Blue=Didn't have local, and seemed a little bit too piecemealPSVue=seems people really like it, this is one I have never testedHulu Live=I loved it, but didn't have local NBC :(DTVN=So... I've settled for it. I pray every time I watch DVR it works, and no pause of live TV drives me insane at times. But it has all the locals, all the cable channels I need (honestly not very many), and it has ""DVR"". If they ever increase, make it work 100%, or add pause live TV, I will be the happiest customer."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Pretty much these were deciding factors that made me choose psvue. Parents had hulu live, and while it was pretty nice, not being able to skip ads without paying an extra $15 a month (bringing the bill close to $60 a month after tax) is a dealbreaker for me. Sling doesn’t let you pause live TV either, and for my family that is a big deal. If it had that option, it would be perfect. I looked hard at dtvn, but I don’t want to fuss with unreliable service, and it seems 1 out of 2 people has problems with it. Also, again you can’t pause live tv. Psvue costs an extra $5 over dtvn and I lose Viacom with it, but I feel like the added convenience, functionalityand reliability of the dvr is worth those concessions. Also, from what people have said psvue currently does not convert your dvr files to On Demand, so you maintain the ability to ff through ads on all shows you record, which is huge. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Weird, I had sling blue and it had my local NBC station.... And my local fox station"
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",Depends on your area I think.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I use Sling and use an HD TV Antenna and I get all the major local channels (including NBC) except for ABC which is very weak in Philly 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I use Vue on TCL Roku TV's combined with a high Def antenna for some non-network local stations. I'm quite happy with it. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","I use Apple TV, not Roku, and I’ve never tried PSV. I have used Sling and DTVN, and I scrapped them both in favor of YouTube TV. The app is great, and you can skip commercials on most recorded shows. The apps for Sling and DTVN were crap, and Sling would stick/skip a lot on live TV. I highly recommend YT."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",If you don't care for sports Philo is amazing cheap (like $16) and you can save shows. Works well with Roku
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",No locals as well
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Chord cutting always has its drawbacks. The freedom of no commercials usually means giving up some programming you were used to before. My advice: get an Apple TV and get Netflix, prime, and Hulu. Use it for about 2 weeks then decide if you want DVR and all the things you had before. The UI on the Apple TV is far superior to the alternatives. "
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","YTTV is the best in my opinion -- having tried all of them extensively.&#x200B;But not having Food/HGTV/Discovery does suck. If they can pick those up and the NFL RedZone, I would be set for life."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",yttv plus philo's $16 package will get you what you want for $56/month. Ps vue Access also can get what you want for $45+tax. What local broadcast streams you get depends on the region so if you can get a dvr and an antenna that opens up your options.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice","Tried a few of the service and finally landed on YouTube TV.Easily the best of the options, IMO.  Only one that the DVR did not lag and suspect the ability to leverage regular YT is why.But also getting unlimited channels and unlimited storage changes everything.  Basically gives you TV on demand, finally.It is bizarre that TV never changed.  You have to watch at a certain time?   That is just insane in our world today."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I decided to try out ps vue since it gets all the locals and has the most powerful dvr. So far it is pretty nice. I also like that it has a bunch of in-app authentications so you can log into channel apps like AMC to view their whole libraries. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I switched from PS VUE to Youtube TV.  No regrets on the switch.  I really like Youtube TV.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I tried Sling but not my favorite. Now I am using Direct TV now for $45 a month but got the first 3 months for $45. It has NBC shows just not all of them. The quality of picture is really good just takes a little time to load which drives my son crazy. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I recommend trying to not replicate the old live TV experience. Try going a month or two without it. You might find you don't miss it at all. Just get Hulu no commercials and/or Netflix. Not being a slave to live TV can have a wonderful overall impact on your life. Having a lot of free time for other better things is a beautiful thing. 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I've been using DTVN now for one year and I really like it because it has all the channels I need. I've had only a few hiccups along the way and would recommend it. The device you use it with really matters. The Apple TV works really good with DTVN. I've used Roku and Fire TV and they don't work nearly as good.
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",I believe there's a free NBC app on Roku... 
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",">  so I can skip commercials Note: Many streaming services will substitute your DVR recording with a Video-on-demand stream (which means you cannot skip the ads).> they lack NBCBuy a Winegard Freevision or Flatwave, aim it out a window, and you'll have NBC (if you're within 20 miles of the station)."
"New Cordcutter Here, looking for advice",some more info https://redd.it/9bq6ku- DTVN more channels but only 20 hr of just ok DVR- PSVue more $ but free DVR for 28 days- YTTV free 9 months DVR- Philo + Sling blue + antenna for $41

Apple's Upcoming Streaming Service Is Reportedly So Bland Staff Are Calling It 'Expensive NBC',">Apple is still aiming to keep its content offerings squeaky clean, with little “gratuitous sex, profanity or violence.” The desire to keep everything family-friendly is reportedly delaying or interfering with many projects. If this is their plan, they need to partner with Disney on their service or go halfsies on Hulu. This isn’t like Apple Music.

Apple's Upcoming Streaming Service Is Reportedly So Bland Staff Are Calling It 'Expensive NBC',"Leave it to Apple to let their marketing dictate content. There's nothing wrong with wanting to produce inoffensive shows for a broad audience. That said, this is a huge red flag. If this many of their productions are having behind-the-scenes drama because of their squeaky clean directives than this does not look good for the future of their platform."
Apple's Upcoming Streaming Service Is Reportedly So Bland Staff Are Calling It 'Expensive NBC',"The keyword in this story is *gratuitous*.  Meaning: *uncalled for; lacking good reason; unwarranted.*Gratuitous sex or violence doesn't serve storytelling, and actually makes a story disjointed... sticking out like a sore thumb. I have no qualms about Apple avoiding gratuitous anything. That's quite different from Apple specifically aiming to be family-friendly, which is more like saying there are stories Apple will simply avoid producing. It's not as if Apple will tell a story about cops pursuing a mass murderer without ever showing any violence."

Apple's Upcoming Streaming Service Is Reportedly So Bland Staff Are Calling It 'Expensive NBC',"If you're any kind of semi-decent parent, then you will understand the intent - if not the execution.  I'm not an overprotective parent, but while he was growing up I didn't want my kid exposed to mature stuff too early and cause him to grow up jaded because he'd seen it all by the time he was 13 or something. That kind of crap is practically *everywhere* nowadays with so few exceptions that it's gotten very hard to avoid exposing underaged kids to concepts like being ""sexy,"" ""popular,"" or worse: ""sluts.""  Preteens shouldn't be worrying about that stuff yet - it really affects their sociological development and how they think and look at the world as they grow up. They often wind up being train wrecks for the rest of their lives because how they think of things has become so skewed.My kid's in his mid-teens now and I pretty much treat him like an adult because I know he's getting exposed to that stuff by now without any help from me. I feel not pretending he isn't exposed to it and giving him the respect of not hiding from the fact it exists is what's kept the lines of communication open between us even though he's definitely in his rebellious teen phase. He knows he can come to me with any topic he may want to talk about and I won't belittle him (although I admit to sometimes teasing him because he obviously didn't even *try* to think about something before asking). Nor do I refuse to talk about something because it's ""too adult.""He's turned out a pretty decent person overall and he's definitely not as jaded or know-it-all as some of his contemporaries. If I hadn't tried to minimize his exposure to mature topics before he was mentally ready for it, I think I'd be having far more trouble with him - particularly considering what I've seen from the neighborhood kids with parents who either just didn't care or didn't have the time to manage what their kids did or watched (which there was a fair amount of since we were living in low-income housing for much of his youth).As a parent I appreciate what Apple's trying to do, but I can understand that not appealing to all. Honestly, I would still want to watch mature content myself after putting the kid to bed. Why they can't just put such content behind a parental control wall like I've seen on my kid's PlayStation is beyond me. I still applaud the effort, though it may not be well thought-out."

best device for sports streaming?,"You will not find a streaming service anywhere that gets you near to real-time. Using the chromecast might add another second or two to the problem, but its not unusual for streaming services to be a 30-60 seconds behind.Example... this afternoon, I was listening to an NFL game via the SiriusXM app on my phone. Towards the end of the game, my son says, ""Wow, they won huh?"".  My feed still had about 45 seconds left on the game clock.I even noticed this last year when watching hockey games on DTVN.. someone would post a goal scored on Twitter while the play was still going on on TV.Nature of the beast. You can't fix it with today's technology."
best device for sports streaming?,"Why does it matter, are the neighbors cheering 10 secs ahead of you? You’ve never watched sports from a dvr or anything?"
best device for sports streaming?,This guy streams sports
best device for sports streaming?,> You’ve never watched sports from a dvr or anything?No and I don’t like to. Why do you care about my sport watching preferences? 
best device for sports streaming?,All streaming services have a delay. The only real way to watch stuff live is to actually go to the games. 
best device for sports streaming?,> The only real way to watch stuff live is to actually go to the games. I realize that; but I’d like to at least be caught up to the broadcast. 
best device for sports streaming?,"My Roku works great with YouTube tv. Amazon Fire TV still doesn’t have YouTube support, so I’d recommend avoiding it. Roku ultra goes for $90 on amazon, IIRC, with other cheaper options. I like the ultra for its Ethernet port and 4K support."
best device for sports streaming?,Any insight on broadcast delays? That is my main issue. I’m also looking at Roku as my main device because it is able to support some of the other streaming services I’m looking at whereas chrome cast does not. So if it solves my delay problem it could be better all around. 
best device for sports streaming?,"I use a Shield and it doesn't solve the delay, it's inherent with the format. For what it's worth, Cable and Sat also have a delay over broadcast - we watched the Super Bowl last year and the garage was getting OTA with an Antenna and the bar area had a cable feed and we were at least 15 seconds ahead in the garage."
best device for sports streaming?,"That’s pretty crazy. I would not expect cable to be that far behind. I may end up switching to AirTV in the future (not just because of this issue, but mostly to save money). I wonder if that would act the same way as a traditional antenna. "
best device for sports streaming?,"Legit something that came up during [an episode of The Solid Verbal a month ago](https://www.solidverbal.com/2018/08/26/consumption-junction/). I think one of the hosts has the same setup (Youtube TV and a Chromecast) too. Not sure it made any difference in terms of devices, though."
best device for sports streaming?,"Sweet, thanks for the link!"
best device for sports streaming?,"Yes, a proper set-too box will probably eliminate that delay since it cuts out the middle man of your computer or phone. The near consensus is the Apple TV is the best set top box in terms of ease-of-use, app quality, and stability. The Apple TV 4K is very powerful and will give you the smoothest experience, even if you don’t have a 4K TV. The 4th-generation Apple TV is slightly slower hardware but still works great for me. Both run the same OS and have YouTube TV and Sunday Ticket apps.Your other options are a Roku or Fire TV, which should work fine if you prefer their interfaces or they fit better with your budget. However, I don’t think the Fire TV supports YouTube TV."
best device for sports streaming?,Does roku work in the same way as Apple TV in terms of “cutting out the middle man” as you say. I’m not super familiar with how roku works. Does it take the stream and send it directly to your screen like other set top boxes would? Or am I going to deal with the same delay I deal with in the chrome cast?
best device for sports streaming?,"I'd say the near-consensus regarding Apple TV is that it's not the best device *unless* you're all-in on the Apple ecosystem. Roku regularly gets better grades for reliability, value, channel support and a straightforward user experience. And that Apple TV remote is just terrible. My newest Roku is the Stick+ and it's the best streaming device I've ever used. It's also regularly sold for 1/3 the price of an Apple TV."
Tv tuner power?,Not all tuners are created equal. 
Tv tuner power?,"Some tuners are better than others, but also the weather/atmospheric conditions play an impact in reception. You may find that your distant TV reception is not a permanent thing. An atmospheric condition called tropospheric ducting will allow radio signals to be stronger and travel further than they normally would."
Tv tuner power?,"I'm looking for the same thing, for the opposite reason. My newer samsung 65 curved screen gets poor reception compared to my old 55 and compared to the samsung 20"" on the same antenna. As far as I know, there are no specs available.  If you find out otherwise please let me know."
Tv tuner power?,"Back when converter boxes were released in 2008, the FCC subjected the boxes to testing to verify they met minimal reception standards.  Boxes that failed were not eligible for the $40 rebate from the government.  Sadly the FCC never applied the same rule to TVs."
Tv tuner power?,I wish Tuner specs where a bigger deal. A good tuner is an important as a good antenna. 
Philadelphia Eagles games - best way to watch,"NFL broadcast contracts are complicated. CBS and FOX own the rights to all sunday afternoon games, and they work with their local affiliates to determine which cities get to see which games each week. See https://506sports.com for maps of which affiliates will get each game each week. Living in SC, you're only guaranteed to get Panthers games each week plus whatever others CBS/FOX decides to give you. Any streaming service or cable/satellite service you get will only give you SC local stations.The only legal way to watch live out of market sunday NFL games is by getting the DirectTV Sunday ticket package. They offer it as an addon to their satellite service, or as a streaming package but only if you live somewhere that is unable to get a dish (specifically an apartment complex or a college dorm). See https://NFLSUNDAYTICKET.TV for details on that."

Advice on cutting the cord for someone who watches a lot of live sports?,"130 including internet and a package that includes Redzone is not that bad if that really includes all the incidental fees and equip rental most of them charge. Is pretty common to end up with$65-70 alone for cable internet once you cut the cable part. Getting locals for football + some package that has redzone is going to be difficult. PS Vue is weak in many markets on locals (some only had CBS, etc). Sling has a good package with Redzone but then you don’t have locals. If you have antenna capabilities where you’re at, using Sling + antenna might make some sense. I use DTVNow at the moment, get all the local sports and sports channels I would like except Redzone. It works pretty well for me here because we have all the locals in my market. They’re beta testing a full Sunday Ticket package now for DTVNow that I might try out if it comes available next year. It’s really the only thing I miss. "

Advice on cutting the cord for someone who watches a lot of live sports?,"Simple.  Use your mother's cable subscription.  Load all the sports apps you need (fs1, watchESPN, etc) on your fire tv, apple tv, nvidia shield, whatever, and use her account to access the content. That's what I do.  Is this stealing cable?  No, at least not in my case.  My mother doesn't watch all those channels anyway, so I watch them for her and report back later :) :)"
Advice on cutting the cord for someone who watches a lot of live sports?,"$130 is a good price for both cable and internet. Most people who turn to streaming are paying $200 per month or more. You’d be luck to save $10 per month with a streaming option: $70 Internet + minimum $50 for streaming. If that $130 includes RedZone, I doubt streaming would save you anything. "

At that point you're getting the same content for the same price.

Only caveat is having a computer or laptop setup with an hdmi cable to your TV.
Advice on cutting the cord for someone who watches a lot of live sports?,"I have Sling (Orange + Blue + Sports) + antenna.  It works great for me, but I live in a fortunate reception area.

After the NFL season is over, I will probably drop down to the Core Blue package for the rest of the year."
Advice on cutting the cord for someone who watches a lot of live sports?,"If you are into sports, either cable or dish is the way to go.  The sports channels are very expensive (~$8/month), but they are subsidized by all your non-sports-watching neighbors helping to share the burden.- Suggestion:  Disconnect all your TVs except one.  Return those boxes to Spectrum, and your monthly bill will drop about $7 per box returned.Take your newly-liberated TVs and add antennas: Winegard Freevision or Flatwave."
ESPN plus problem,See my post a few down the main page. Similar issue but for ESPN authentication for me. ESPN+ worked fine.Eventually it just worked after a few attempts. Apparently it's a known issue.

xfinity streaming is not that great,"The service isn’t too bad via web browser. Although the FPS sucks, I swear xfinity limits it to 20-25 fps, so the motion lag is quite annoying.

xfinity streaming is not that great,I don't know. Its garbage though I don't even use it. As soon as I get a job I'm going to signup for fiber and ditch cable.
New Antenna or Amp,A higher gain antenna will almost always increase signal to noise ratio while a preamp will only increase signal to noise ratio in the case where the signals are so weak that the loss from the cable becomes an issue. Normally it is best to spend money on antenna performance if at all possible.That antenna is pretty weak on VHF-high band signals. What channels/networks are you having problems with?
New Antenna or Amp,Mostly channel 5 (Fox). Which antenna do you recommend? Thank you!
New Antenna or Amp,"Fox and NBC are both UHF band channels and for all we can tell your existing antenna is somewhat good at the UHF band. So much for that idea.You might want to try moving the antenna around or at least pointing it in different directions if you have not yet done so.

Do Low Emissivity windows block TV waves?,My understanding is that low-E windows use metallic coatings that are invisible in most light. So you might not be able to tell just by looking.

Seasons 2 and 3 are available now on DVD. Then the show was sold to ABC for season 4 on. After Diana Rigg left (Season 6 and 7) it really went downhill. Basically, *nobody* has Season 1. The only ""streaming"" format is Season 5 (for purchase on Amazon or Vudu) or you can buy the DVDs."

Need help finding an attic antenna,The signals are strong and from the same direction (southwest). So most any UHF/VHF-high antenna should work.

I rarely watch the Apple TV in that room because of the remote, and prefer my 3rd Gen Apple TV in another room.What do you do with a remote?   HOLD IT IN YOUR HAND.   You absolutely cannot do that with their trackpad remote.   I cannot think why they thought it was a good idea."

"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","Sure, just add an antenna to the TV for you local stations. "
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","I'm really new to this and have no idea where to even start, sorry. Can you elaborate a little more or link me to something?"
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","Cord cutting isn’t for everyone. If things like this seem really complicated, I’d be cautious before making the plunge. Dip your toes first. Use free trials to see what works. Ultimately, it’s their money and choice."
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","If you get a Roku or Fire streaming device, please use a wired connection to it. Most streaming issues I've run into have been resolved by plugging in my network connection.Some will tell you this complicates the setup.  I say it simplifies it by taking the wireless aspect out of the troubleshooting equation."
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning",Depending on location could the NewsOn app cover the local news aspect?
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","I would see how much can be replicated on an iPad, then he can watch anywhere:ABC News by ABC Digitalhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/abc-news/id300255638?mt=8CBS News: Live Breaking News by CBS Interactivehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cbs-news-live-breaking-news/id334256223?mt=8"
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","Yea that's a good idea, the only problem is, is that he generally watches the news on the TV while he's on his iPad doing other things. So that wouldn't really work unfortunately. Also, how did you know he had an iPad or Apple product in general? lol, that's the only apple product in the house xD"
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","Google TV, Hulu Live TV, or Playstation Vue (worst name ever, you don't need a Playstation) will do this if you cannot get an antenna working.Check they offer your local channels first as they all have a free trial so you try it for 7 days or so. You'll also need an internet TV box, e.g. Roku, nVidia Shield, Apple TV. But that's a one-off investment and will give you access to all services like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. It just plugs into your TV with a HDMI cable like any other cable box.I use Google TV, which can ""record"" shows to watch later or even just 5 mins late. By record, I mean I mark the series and it is available to watch anytime after it airs. It's all stored by Google so there is nothing else you need download. Your Dad could watch morning news live, start a couple of minutes late, and pause it while it's on.As for price, depends how much are they paying. I would be paying Comcast $120-$150 once you add in the bundles, surcharges, taxes, equipment, and so on. Google is $40. PS Vue is $45-$80. Hulu is $40. Plus my internet for $60.Something to look into further."
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning",Dunno what network he watches the news on but some now have YouTube channels for their newscasts and have full daily episodes along with segments and what not. 
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","This is long.. but don't be scared! Getting local TV over the air is similar to getting a radio station over the air. All TVs sold in the US contain the necessary cards to support broadcast TV. However, TV has all moved to Digital, which means you can't access channels unless a re-scan on your TV to find them all first. Re-scanning is pretty easy to do, just go into your TV menu, usually it's under ""Channel"" or ""Signal"" or something like that.Before even looking into an antenna, you'll need to figure out how close/easy to receive the station you're looking for will be. I've linked the FCC site below, put in your address and see if it's towards the top of the list. There's also TV Fool, which tends to be more detailed but slightly out of date. Check both. Also take into account if you live in a building with thick walls or in a neighborhood with a lot of trees, they will make signals harder to receive. If you're in the green on both TVfool and the FCC sites, it should be possible to get it with an indoor antenna.I'm assuming you're going to want at least Newschannel 9 (Chattanooga), with the callsign WTVC. TVfool has a callsign lookup with a guide for indoor/outdoor reception. Plug ""WTVC"" in there and check your neighborhood. It looks like that station still broadcasts on Channel 9, so you're going to want an antenna that supports VHF at least, more on that at the very end.If you've checked the resources, and getting the stations you want over the air is possible, it's time to get an antenna. You can spend really as much as you want, I've linked to the Winegard flatwave below which is recommended by the sub and fairly cheap. If the rating an TVfool for the station you want is below 50 or so NM (dB) there's an amplified version.https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmapshttps://www.tvfool.com/https://www.amazon.com/Winegard-FlatWave-FL-5000-High-VHF-Ultra-Thin/dp/B0063705PE/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1537677684&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=winegard+flatwave&psc=1"
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","This, to me, is the classic exmple of the bad side of cord cutting.  I find it to be a generally bad idea to convince ""older"" people to cord cut.  Most over 40 are to tied to the old way of watching tv and/or have no time or desire to learn how to do cord cutting right so it still delivers the programming they want at a significant cost reduction.  Part of this is also because the younger generation trying to urge them to do so lacks the ability to truly do a cost analysis to make sure it is even worth it for someone to cut the cord and just spout off nonsensical statements about how much money can be saved without truly knowing the situation.  For some cord cutting is great and saves money - but not for all.  This post is a classic example of this as right off the bat the op suggests 30+ per month in subscription costs and seems to have no clue about how to stream these services to a television.  Also, if op isnt' smart enough to know that the local news and gma are available ota he probably shouldn't be advising anyone on cord cutting.  This is not meant to slam this particulary op but really, do some research before you jump on the bandwagon and maybe you should sit down and really discuss the whole situation with your parents before trying to 'help' them. "
"Trying to convince family to ditch Direct TV, but my Dad needs to watch the news every morning","Not people over 40; people over 65-70 have a hard time cord cutting.  People in their 40's -50's were coming of age or young workers when the Internet came online.You have a point though ; people dropping cable are fed up with poor service and costs.  Their children encouraging them to cut the cord is not their motivation, or incentive."

"New T-Mobile’s plans for in-home, fixed wireless internet services to cover more than 250 million people with data rates greater than 300 Mbps by 2024, competing with Charter and Comcast",Is this only in the US? Because 250 million is 3/4 of the entire country.
"New T-Mobile’s plans for in-home, fixed wireless internet services to cover more than 250 million people with data rates greater than 300 Mbps by 2024, competing with Charter and Comcast",They're the only unlimited offering in my area.

I worked for a major telecom company that was planning on covering a quarter of the country using fixed wireless around Y2Kish.  The speed of wired broadband outpaces the speed of wireless so quickly that by the time you have a fixed wireless product ready to go to market, no one wants it because the speeds are so bad compared to wired internet.

"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","As you know, FIOS marks Fox channels and some premium channels as copy-once. This will prevent you from watching/recording those channels in Plex. That's not going to change with Prime 6, nor is there any plausible way for Plex to ever support DRM channels.The thing you heard about DRM and the Prime 6 is probably tied to the SiliconDust DVR software. They've long promised support for recording DRM channels, but hasn't happened yet (you can watch those channels on some devices, but you can't record).If Fox/Fox Sports/Fox News/NatGeo/FX/etc are important channels to you, then I don't think you'll be happy with Plex."
"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","Thank you so much for the info! Fox stuff really isn't too important to me, but I might as well play with multiple ways to watch the stream and give the HD Homerun software a fair chance. "
"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","I'm in the NY area, have FiOS internet and did the cablecard via HDHomerun Prime.  I used Plex DVR.  I switched to streaming tv and I have a lightly used one if you're interested PM me."
"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","I doubt the DRM channels will be treated substantially differently on the 6 tuner Prime, as it's one of the major qualifications for CableCard certification. Unless Plex wants to build in support for the DRM (and everything I've seen indicates they have no plan to do so), I wouldn't expect to be able to use it for DRM channels.If you want a PC-based solution that does support CableCard DRM for DVR, right now your only option is Windows Media Center. And that comes with its own issues that will likely never be fixed since it is a deprecated product. Silicondust supports live viewing DRM channels in the HDHomeRun app on Windows and Android TV, but the DVR doesn't support it yet (though they do plan to support it at some point). Tivo is also an option, but that gets pricey once you factor in the service subscription. "
"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","If you are truly wanting to save serious money, then get rid of trying to purchase a bundle of cable channels.   Put up an antenna for local channels, put a Roku on each TV and stick to apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.  Purchase any shows that you can't do without.  This is what cord cutting used to be about.   "
"HDHomerun Prime, buy used or play the waiting game?","I appreciate the tip and that is the ultimate goal, but in this area it doesn't make financial sense. We have the lowest tier verizon package which gives us a lot of channels for $12/month on top of our internet package. If we wanted to drop the cable part, it would be a fee to break the contract, the price of internet would go up (the bundle brings it down) and we would have to pay for more services on top of it. We also only have one cable box currently, so it isn't like cutting out the cable will lower box rentals substantially (in fact the resulting increase in internet price would negate that anyway). Instead, trading the $12/mo for the cable box for a $5/mo cable card and getting all the benefits of a DVR would be a huge upgrade for my current situation. "

Acorn TV and Brit Box quality?,"We use both and like them both.  If you are a fan of British shows and in the USA, they are a must.  I'm not sure what you are referring to wrt to quality.  We use Acorn and BritBox internet VOD.  "
Acorn TV and Brit Box quality?,"Broadly speaking, Acorn and Brit Box stream content that American cable channels and bigger streaming companies chose not to license. If you're a BBC lover aware of what's being shown in the UK on the BBC and ITV in the past few years, you'll be disappointed.Examples... The BBC's biggest export is Doctor Who now that Top Gear's stars have moved to Amazon Prime, and The Great British Bake Off has moved to Channel 4. Neither Acorn nor BritBox stream any seasons of Top Gear or Bake Off (both are on Netflix in the US... though the latter has been renamed The Great British Baking Show to avoid Pillsbury's trademark of the phrase 'bake off'). Meanwhile, only BritBox has Doctor Who, but only episodes from before the show rebooted in 2005 (it's the new stuff everyone watches). New Who is only on Amazon Prime in the US.If you don't mind watching older content and B content, then you'll be pleased with Acorn or BritBox. As for streaming quality, they're all the same. Your issue is likely with your Internet provider, not Hulu. An exception might be something unusual specific to your streaming box, such as having an older box whose Hulu app is no longer supported. If you're using a modern streaming box, then look to your Internet provider as the cause."
Acorn TV and Brit Box quality?,Do either show the original Avengers 1961 show?
Issue with Live TV streaming ONLY,"If possible hardwire everything.From what I remember, yhe reason why things like Netflix don't have this issue vs live TV vs streaming service is that live TV is much more sensitive to dips in speed. There is no buffering for a live feed."
Issue with Live TV streaming ONLY,"I can't hardwire any of them. All in different rooms and too far from the router. Are you saying what I am experiencing is not buffering? If not, then what is it?"

How to save a DVR'd movie before canceling?,Same as all the others. Even if there was a service that let you download the recording no doubt it would have some encryption that you would need to have an active subscription to watch it. And I don’t know how the services work but I know most streaming services won’t play while a desktop recorder is running on the computer. At the end of the day if you want to consume content and enjoy the product of people’s labor and time you need to pay for it.

Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,Do you have enough room for a smaller outdoor antenna used indoors? I am thinking of a 2 bay UHF type which you would have to aim north-northeast. Examples:* Digiwave ANT2088 AKA Solid Signal XS HDB2X AKA Stellar Labs 30-2420* Channel Master CM-4220HD* Eagle Aspen DTV2BUHFYou could in theory get the 60 mile signals with a high gain UHF band antenna put up high. Over such a long distance the signals probably would not be reliable and you would probably have outages caused by weather conditions. Your close transmitters could make reception of such weak signals difficult. You probably wouldn't get the 31 mile PBS as it would be coming in from the side of the antenna and high gain antennas are very directional. Probably not worth it unless you really want the 60 mile signals.
Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,"Thanks for the suggestions, will check them for dimensions and make some measurements to see if something will fit.  Educated guess is yes we can fit something like these, though, so that's great.  Did you list them in order of your recommendation, or no particular order?&#x200B;The 60mi signals aren't really worth the trouble for us, especially if they wouldn't be strong enough to rely on, thank you for the info on those."

Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,"Consider a ClearStream Eclipse Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna which sells for $49,99.Even without using the included +20dB amplifier, mine delivers stations that are far weaker than the -44 dBm of your PBS affiliate.The Eclipse is a flat wall-mount with a wide dipole reception pattern. Assuming you have a wall or other mounting surface that faces the antenna to the North, you should easily receive all your LOS stations. I'd wager that, using the in-line amplifier, stations out at 60 miles would come in acceptably as well."
Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,Which model specifically are you recommending?  There seem to be a lot of these.
Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,You'll get the best PBS reception with a left leaning antenna.
Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,"It appears that most DTV channels today use the UHF band, which can be easily received with the bow-tie or flat style antenna.But some DTV channels are still broadcast on the VHF band.  This is why the older style rabbit ears antennas had the two dipole antennas plus the loop or bow tie style, because analog TV was broadcast on both bands, and it varied by each station as to what they used.  The dipole antennas were needed to pick up the VHF stations.If you check with TVFool [https://www.tvfool.com/?option=com\_wrapper&Itemid=29](https://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29) or AntennaWeb [https://antennaweb.org/Address](https://antennaweb.org/Address) for your area, you can easily identify the broadcast band that your PBS station is using.  VHF occupies the ""Real"" or ""RF"" channel numbers ch. 2-13, while UHF is ch. 14 and higher.You could also try an old fashioned set of rabbit ears with a coax connected to your TV if that PBS station broadcasts on VHF.  If that works, you probably won't have very good luck with the flat style antenna. "
Indoor Antenna suggestions to get PBS stations?,"There is nothing wrong with VHF channels, all major TV markets are assigned VHF channels.  Once you get out of the big cities you will find UHF islands, my market being one of them.  "

Amazon ReCast,"If one of the streaming services that has a great DVR (Vue, Hulu or YouTube TV), and offers all of your local channels, you’re better off going that route than buying the Recast. If you don’t care about cable channels and want just local channels and you’re able to get all of them via an OTA antenna without any issue, then the Recast might be perfect for you."
Amazon ReCast,"So far I have not seen any Streaming service that has subchannels like ThisTV, Movies, AntennaTV, Cozi, Gameshow, etc.  I spend more time watching these subchannels than the main channel, therefore need an antenna."
Amazon ReCast,"Sling has a OTA DVR called the Air TV that integrates with their service. It also works if you don't havd Sling but it doesn't have the Sling guide integrated without Sling service. There's also an OTA DVR called Tablo. I personally have this one. It has an on screen guide and can also be used to send multiple streams throughout the house. So for instance if she's watching ABC in one room but you want to watch NBC in another you can do this without having to hook up multiple antennas.  You can also record multiple shows at once depending on how many tuners you decided to go with. I have the 2 tuner version but there's also a 4 tuner one. Another benefit of Tablo is if you pay for their subscription you can watch and record your local channels outside the house. The subscription is $4.99/month, $49.99/year, $150/lifetime that stays with the account not the device so if you buy a newer Tablo the subscription works for them both. Tablo works without their subscription service as well but you wouldn't be able to watch and record your local channels away from home. "
Amazon ReCast,Hard sell there. Recast offers 2 and 4 tuners to watch and record multiple streams but there are no additional costs for a guide or to watch live or recorded content outside the home. The two benefits tablo has over Recast are that the device costs are cheaper and that it’s platform agnostic. 
Amazon ReCast,Amazon FireTV Recast..... no never heard of it.  It has not been mentioned on this forum  ;-)   And yes it sounds like a great way to marry Free broadcast TV with a DVR and streaming service (Prime).
Amazon ReCast,"This is the route I will be going as I just preordered one.  But, I have several Fire TV devices in the house, so everything should hopefully work really well together.  I plan on updating once I have received and used it."
Amazon ReCast,"Yes seems  like the easiest all in one solution. Too late for me. I went Plex pass Nvidia Shield (already owned one) Hdhomerun.  Plex pass does have the auto commercial skip for the DVR, it works pretty well. The only thing it seems to more is the network show commericals."

What is a good DVR for both Over The Air and Cable?,"Not sure if there's any box that can do both at the same time. A workaround would be to get both an HDHomeRun Connect for OTA and HDHomeRun Prime for cable. You can then combine both of them inside various client/server software to freely switch between the two as if they were one source.Though I've heard that Plex currently only supports one guide source at a time. So you can only get guide info for either OTA or Cable channels. The workaround I've seen for this involve adding the cable channels first, then adding the OTA channels and mapping them to their cable equivalents in the guide."

I pulled the plug on them in 2012 and haven't looked back.  We didn't miss the cable channels, maybe ultimately that is your answer. "

Looking for an OTA to HDMI adapter or DVR,Seems like you could buy a digital tuner box. They have coax in and HDMI out. Run about $30-40. 
Looking for an OTA to HDMI adapter or DVR,Thank you. 
Looking for an OTA to HDMI adapter or DVR,"A digital converter box from Walmart or Target will convert it to HDMI. Some of them have guide data too, like the Channel Master at https://www.channelmaster.com/ConverterBox_Digital_to_Analog_Converter_Box_p/cm-7004.htmI have used several different HDMI switchers, and they work, sort of. HDMI is kind of finicky, so every now and then the cable wouldn't complete the ""handshake"" between my antenna DVR and the switch or  TV, or from my Roku to the TV. There is a process to fix it and I don't remember the exact sequence but it was something like you turn everything off, disconnect the cable in a certain way ... I forget which end had to be disconnected first, then you power on the Roku before the TV ... Some crazy thing like that. It happened three or four times a year so it wasn't too bad."
Looking for an OTA to HDMI adapter or DVR,"Any ATSC tuner you buy at Walmart will deliver an HDMI signal to your set.Recorders are more expensive. You build or buy, and yes the scheduling costs can be onerous.Schedules direct is a non profit. They deliver good quality schedules for $25/yr ( a steal). If you are handy at plumbing such things and resurrecting ancient hardware, the old ReplayTv can be interfaced to to Schedules direct.Hollywood mostly killed recorders. Very few are available now. You must be stubborn to bring those capabilities back. No manufactuer will take the risk of doing it for you....even with the betamax Supreme Court decision.The weasels won."

Advice for being a cheap prick to DirectTV Now?,"The OTT streaming cable services like DirecTV Now don't rely on long-term contracts much, so the classic moves you could make with traditional cable/satellite providers don't work with them.

"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I wonder if Amazon will be smart enough to aggregate the data on what people are watching so they can consider what future content purchases to make. I also wonder if they will sell that data to third parties.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Yes and yes. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",TiVo does that too and charges a monthly fee for the privilege
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I bailed on the FireTV ecosystem when they started putting ads in the UI. I expect this DVR will be an order of magnitude worse.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I really think that's the only reason for this hardware. People under 30 I assume dont use DVRs. Netflix changed that for everyone. Now I know people want to record the news and all that but most local broadcasters are going online and saving their streams soooo idk I think a DVR is a old tech clinging to life.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Make money by making money. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",They are probably selling the boxes at a loss so they can get that sweet sweet data.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I’m so glad that this device has been released. Amazon is bringing OTA TV into the spotlight and we may see r/cordcutters get a bump in numbers I have an RCA Yagi sending 20 channels to my HDHR Quattro linked to Plex DVR and am very satisfied.But I will never say no to competition, it stops companies getting lazy, lowers prices, and improves functionality and efficiency."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I tried but just gave up at my new location. Wasn't going to worry about mounting an antenna to the outside of my house. The cost of the plex server, lifetime plex, storage, shield TV, HDHR, and antennas (needed 2 to get all channels) came out to a pretty penny. Not to mention it wouldn't eliminate all costs for me as I still would have had side streaming services.I couldn't justify it without a quick 1 or 2 year breakeven especially when for the NFL as an example the reception would get noticeably worse only for that event."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Does this require a monthly subscription for the guide? Or do you get a lifetime guide with purchase of the hardware (like the Tivo Roamio OTA)?
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Lifetime guide data is included. No additional ongoing fee.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I imagine this to work like the Fire TV Editions that pull in guide data automatically (and for free) once the antenna is connected and channels are scanned. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",so you would only be able to record things that air over an antennae right? 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Yes
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Am I crazy for hoping this has Chromecast support?
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","This will most likely never happen as the two companies hate each other. Amazon won't even sell Chromecasts. But yes, some sort of casting ability would be nice."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Certifiably insane
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Google won't let Amazon have a YouTube app so I'm sure Amazon won't let them have this either. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",It will work on Android TV though. So there's always that method if you want to get on board with Android TV. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","For me, this is the perfect device for a few reasons.1)  It is pricier than the 4-tuner Tablo, but I do not have to subscribe to a service.  As such, it will be cheaper in the end.2)  We have several Fire TV devices, so this is not an issue.  Even better, we can watch what we want on any of the TVs.3)  We have really good OTA service, so we should be able to record the vast majority of what we want.I am going to place a pre-order and cross my fingers it works as well as promised."

"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","That's rather pricey. Edit:Should of added I'm in UK,I can get a You view DVR for about £40...so it's way to pricey to me.Not this will ever come to the uk"
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Not compared to the TiVo option I was looking at the other day...
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Oh very much so but here in the US the TV market is entirely broken. In the UK there's no end of cheap DVRs and uptake of OTA (Freeview) is much higher. Also no need for subscription based EPGs because who thought that would be a good idea?!
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I hope it comes to the UK. There's nothing available that can stream recorded hd content to another device.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","Spendy, but could be an HD Homerun killer."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Seems more like a Tablo competitor.  I actually prefer the HDHR way of doing things where I can use my NAS to accumulate shows and do whatever I want with the files (or upgrade to something bigger).  I do appreciate the simplicity of the all-in-one solution like this one though.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","Now it makes perfect sense why the Fire streaming devices have continued to have native support for MPEG2. That's the format for OTA broadcasts. They've been planning this for a while it would seem...Roku is really hurting themselves by not supporting MPEG2 on their boxes!We were a 4 Roku house until we started watching OTA content via an HDHR and Emby. We are now a 3 Fire box + 1 Roku house SOLEY bc Roku doesn't support MPEG2. To watch any live OTA broadcasts through a Roku requires that everything be transcoded into a format Roku supports. This taxes our server needlessly, causes the Roku to change channels VERY slowly compared to Fire, and makes the shows coming from the TV connected to our high-end Roku 4k Ultra box anywhere from 15s to 20s behind even the cheapest little FireStick we own. Roku as a company can't seem to get out of their own damn way. The only thing they have going for them anymore is that they FINALLY make a remote that can control the power and volume of your television but it took them years of being yelled at by customers before they did it. If it weren't for that remote we wouldn't even keep the 1 Roku we still have... The lack of MPEG support is very much a deal breaker for anyone streaming live OTA antenna throughout their home."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I doubt it.  I've got to believe that Amazon's going to transcode that OTA single down to something smaller/manageable  (e.g. H.264).  Especially since they're claiming this thing can be used to push from the DVR to a Fire TV device via WiFi.  Trying to push around a \~2MB/sec OTA MPEG2 signal over WiFi is not going to make for a good consumer experience.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","Sounds like it will do what a TiVo does at a lower price. Remember you have to add storage to a HDHR, plus use a streaming device at the TV, so the price difference is not too much. Channel Master has the Stream+ at $149, but it requires another storage device, so you're up to about $210. Then they don't have Netflix or Prime. And it's one device per TV.This is promising."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","That is exactly where my mind went.  They are taking aim at Tivo OTA...in addition to Tablo, Plex, HDHomeRun, etc. But doing the Tivo OTA cheaper and with the ability to stream to  Fire OS, IOS, and Android without the need for something like the 'Tivo Stream' box. And then they beat out all the Tablo/HDHomerun/etc boxes by not requiring a subscription for guides or requiring you to BYO hard drive.  Promising indeed.  Too bad I hate Fire OS and the Fire TV's.  "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Sounds like it does what a Tablo does.I wonder if it has a spinning rust drive or an SSD.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","The article states that competitors like TiVo require a subscription, but my understanding was the OTA TiVo did not require a subscription (but it is no doubt pricey). "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",The retail price of the latest TiVo Roamio OTA was $400. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","No, you still need a subscription. The expensive-for-what-you-get DVR + the way-under-powered-and-still-costs-a-lot minis ends up hurting the wallet pretty badly.Of course you can always buy the lifetime pass."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",That is one fugly piece of hardware. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","its just a black box.  who cares what it looks like, its about what it does"
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",But if you stick it in a closet somewhere who cares.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",[removed]
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I find Amazon's style to be fugly.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I was about to downvote you without even looking at the picture, thinking ""come on, no modern piece of electronics can be THAT bad.""Nope. I was wrong. That's hideous. Looks like some old intercom from the 60s."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Marginally better than [Sony's box](https://www.theonion.com/sony-releases-new-stupid-piece-of-shit-that-doesnt-fuck-1819594774)
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I think that is why one of the main things talked about in the article is ""you can hide it"". You would definitely want to hide that."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","The free ongoing guide data/DVR service, plus the smooth integration in with the Fire TV UI, Alexa and Amazon Channels, are what set this product apart from Tablo. Tablo offers similar products, with a bit cheaper total hardware pricing (including a separate USB hard drive), but then Tablo charges an ongoing program guide fee or a once-only lifetime guide data charge of $150. Once you add that in, the cost is way more than the Amazon Fire TV Recast. Although Tablo does offer the option of using a Roku or Apple TV for viewing; the Recast requires a Fire TV stick, box or TV."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","It appears to have some unexpected limitations in how many of the tuners you can use at once while recording things.  If I'm reading this right, if you are recording 4 things at once, and stream anything, including only recorded shows, one of the recordings will stop.From the FAQ on Amazon's site:> How many programs can I record at once? Can I record a program while watching another live or recorded program?> > With a 2-tuner Fire TV Recast, you can:> > * record 2 programs at once,> * watch a live or recorded program while recording another; OR> * watch 2 live or recorded programs on different devices at once.> > With a 4-tuner Fire TV Recast, you can:> > * record 4 programs at once;> * watch 1 live or recorded program while recording 3 other programs in the background; OR> * watch 2 live or recorded programs on different devices at once while recording 2 other programs in the background."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I'm guessing their streaming magic includes hardware based reencoding (along with some other magic) and they limited these pathways in the design.  They also likely limited CPU, network I/O, and/or RAM of the backend based on intended use of 4 streams concurrent.  With 4 tuners worth of HDHomeRun (and mythtv) I can record all 14 program streams that I can receive over the air at the same time because they're in the same four transport streams.  "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I don't like that you can't hook a tv directly to the device. You can only stream from the box. My internet is too slow to waste on streaming local channels when I already have a cable ran to each tv. If you had fast internet and didn't want to run coax around the house, this would be nice. "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",The speed of your actual connection doesn’t matter if all the traffic is local. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",The internet speed you pay for has no bearing on this. Your local internet speed depends on your router not your ISP. Everything should stream just fine locally. As for out and about using a mobile device - that will depend on the upload speed of your ISP.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I have the same concern, but a different reason. I really like the uncompressed look of OTA HD. I was hoping this thing would have a fire TV interface built in and could play the recordings and live TV right off the device. Guess TiVo will continue to get my yearly fee. "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Time to get a switch and run CAT6 through your home. Turned out to be a lot cheaper than buying a $200 WiFi router. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I read the article. Have they said what format this will stream in?  Seems like a nice product but a little late for me as I have a Hdhomerun running Plex (lifetime pass) on my Nvidia shield.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","With Black Friday just around the corner you may be better off waiting to get Plex Lifetime Pass (Historically 50%), a HD Homerun (Historically +30%), and a good antenna. This way you won’t be locked into the Amazon infrastructure unless that something you are seeking. You might come out cheaper, have an expandable amount of storage, be able to connect it all to your homes LAN, and share it with your family/friends. "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","You say that, but I seriously doubt we don’t see a Black Friday discount on this box as well..."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","So long, TiVo!  It's been fun.Finally a single UI for broadcast, streaming and a local DVR with a normal channel grid and no inputs to change!TiVo should've made this box 10 years ago but squandered everything."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","I have an older TiVo Roamio OTA that does exactly this, but the number of apps is limited, and the apps it does have like HBOGo, Netflix and MLB.TV are very, very slow."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Amazon's Fire/TV devices continue to disappoint. They should just release a VCR and make the circle complete. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",why do they make you buy 2 tuners?
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",The 2-tuner model means you can record two different channels at the same time. Or you can watch 1 channel while recording another.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Very similar to tivos DVR. And cheaper!
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","The two tuner version will probably be DOA. I'm in the middle of nowhere and still want several things being recorded -  at let say 8pm. The four tuner version offers more space and two more tuners, so depending on how smart their record algo is, I could deal with that. Assuming it can also download amazon prime to the HDD, I might get this,"
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","It can only record OTA signals to the local drive. All of the OTA DVRs with a local drive seem to have this limitation except for the HD Homerun DVR service that allows you to record OTA and at least some of the programs in their ""skinny bundle"" package of cable channels."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I'm glad there's another option and probably a better UI and integration but I'm happy with my hdhomerun setup with plex and mycloud 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","But if I already have DirectTV Now and I'm not planning on watching local sports or news, does this really work for me? The DVR being 150 hours is certainly a boon, but I can't think I'd need it given I'm mostly watching non-basic channels anyway"
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",No reason. This is strictly targeted at OTA users.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","When I get a projector, I’ll probably need one of these things, since they don’t have tv tuners.  Hopefully the interface is smooth.  Currently, I’m using win media 7 to record football.  "
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Amazon needs to offer live streaming TV 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Not gonna happen 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Too expensive.

"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",i like the concept but i only have a fire stick. i prefer my nvidia shield or my smartTV apps. is there an alternative for me? 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",This would stream your antenna channels to your Fire Stick. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",so Amazon Tablo basically?
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","i can't switch back to fire tv, until they make a version with volume on the remote."
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Will it auto identify your channels and populate a program guide for you? This is the most handy feature of a cable company DVR box. I have a tuner card on my PC and it records fine. It's just a pain trying to look up schedules and manually set beginning and end times.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Plex will handle that for you or nextpvr with the TV guide.com import will do it for free. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Yes
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",It will be interesting to compare this to the Channelmaster Stream+
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Is this only for over-the-air channels?
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Yes
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I wonder if this will work with any Fire TV stick and Fire TV or just the more recent ones ?I have a 1st gen Fire TV stick and Fire TV at home as well as the original Amazon Show (plus a 1st gen Echo and four 2nd gen Dots).
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",>I wonder if this will work with any Fire TV stick and Fire TV or just the more recent ones ?  >  >I have a 1st gen Fire TV stick and Fire TV at home as well as the original Amazon Showjust saw on the FAQ page: Fire TV Recast works with all generations of Fire TV streaming media players and Fire TV Edition televisions.

"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",I really hope they make this open to work with Plex. That's my main issue with the Tablo is it's not open which kinda sucks. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",anyone see in the specs for out of home streaming...doesn't seem to be real clear on that.  would like to stream on my firestick at work.  
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",Now would it be possible to some use this with directv now via fire stick or maybe Apple TV? That would be awesome if they could do something like that
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",You didn’t read the last bullet point fully. 
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)","So this is basically a tablo without the monthly fee and doesn't (yet) work with roku?I'm in the market for a dvr because I have a super cheap one that rarely works.

"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",There's so many ways to watch your favorite content a DVR almost isn't needed.
"Amazon announces DVR, Fire TV Recast (updating)",A DVR is really handy if you want to actually cut the cord from cable AND the cable-like services like Sling and PS Vue.

I'm saving $840 a year over my Dish subscription.

Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,"> Is this internet speed enough???Heh.  I have just 1 Mbit/s so yeah 150 is MORE than enough.   Barebones internet you only need 2 Mbps*3 people == 6 Mbit/s for HD video streaming, so 150 is plenty.     I'd probably consider a stronger antenna like Winegard Freevision or CM4228 or rooftop antenna."
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,I’m in an apartment so a rooftop antenna is not an option- I will look into the other antenna. Thanks!!
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,How so you stream anything on 1mbps?
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,"150mb is more then enough, I currently have the same as you in that aspect.

Sooner or later as you get more into the possibilities of cord cutting/entertainment, you may look into upgrading from the firestick to a more powerful streaming box for setting up and streaming your own personal music and video library. I would suggest a Nvidia Shield but that’s just my own personal preference. "
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,Thank you! I keep hearing about this Nvidia shield as I thumb through this group- I will definitely look into this!
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,"Two people streaming in HD?  15 Mbps would be sufficient. To do 4K on one TV, 50 Megs would be comfortable. 150 is way more than you’ll ever need. Maybe if you were simultaneously streaming in 4K to six separate TVs. "
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,good luck with the mohu

Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,HD Homerun with Channels DVR is pretty awesome IMO. Nvidia Shield is incredible as well.  
Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,Thanks! I looked into the HD homerun. Is this an antenna device within itself as well or it works like the tablo and simply wields the control for rewind /Ff and recording of the TV from the antenna?

Okay! I’m new here but cutting the cord!,Awesome! Thanks!I am going to hold off on the bias lighting as well. I would rather have a sound bar. I will look into the mohu sky 60 as well. It has mixed reviews (but I guess a lot of things do) some spectacular and some awful.

Yahoo Sports App NFL,"Yeah, I just downloaded it again, and yeah, on a Verizon phone it is saying you need LTE on. That is new because it is supposed all mobile devices including tablets which don't have LTE in most cases.Edit: when I click on help I see an orange message stating ""Its NFL season and that means games streamed in the Yahoo Sports App. Tonight's game (Sept 20), Jets vs Browns is limited to mobile phones* w/cell data only. Look for all of our other live week 3 games, which are available via wiki or cell data on your mobile devices.""What the hell, Verizon??? Even I, a non sports fan, think this is totally wrong. "
Yahoo Sports App NFL,"Mine does that on AT&T, it's a load of crap. "
Yahoo Sports App NFL,So confused...
Yahoo Sports App NFL,This only applies to games on NFL Network. All other games on Sunday that you can stream in the app work on WiFi.
Yahoo Sports App NFL,So people understand what's coming...Wireless and cable/internet provider convergence with data caps.  Then packages with great rates to stream you video and content that eats up your data and forces you into higher tiers of service.
Yahoo Sports App NFL,Oh joy...
Yahoo Sports App NFL,I was able to start the streaming on LTE and then turn on wifi from the quick toggles and it kept playing over wifi.
Yahoo Sports App NFL,That’s slick!  I’ll have to try that next time 
Yahoo Sports App NFL,That's just Yahoo's deal with the NFL. 
Yahoo Sports App NFL,Boo...
Yahoo Sports App NFL,Same thing with Cricket/AT&T. You need to use cellular data; no wifi allowed.

Yahoo Sports App NFL,How would Net Neutrality change this?
Yahoo Sports App NFL,This literally has nothing to do with Net Neutrality. This has to do with NFL restricting games that are only on the NFL Network to mobile data only. 
Does DirectTV now let me watch shows from 3 days ago at no extra cost?,"Well, if you can get it OTA then you could get a DVR to record their favorite programs that way. A Tablo for example can even be programmed to only keep X amount of recent recordings of you want to keep the latest news broadcasts, or whatever, recorded without filling up the storage.Also SlingTV just updated their AirTV device to support DVR if you hookup a USB HDD, and it integrates the channels and recordings with the SlingTV app."

"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",It still doesn't seem to make Fire TV useful for most people.This google/amazon spat needs to end.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",Apple must be happy to see it continue though 
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","It's sad, but I want this exact product, except made by Google. Once you're invested into one of these ecosystems, you can't really change. I can't just throw some Amazon/Alexa gear into my Google Home environment to enjoy the new tech, I've got to wait until Google comes out with something equivalent. It's a little lame, this walled garden that's being set up with our homes."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","If this device worked with other streaming devices, maybe.  I have a a mixed array of devices:  Roku, Apple TV, and Fire Cube.  I have an HD Homerun on my network - it works well.  I use it with Plex.When I get some time, I plan on trying out SageTV, MythTV and TVHeadEnd.  If the FireTV ""just worked"" (maybe an app for the other devices?), I'd have interest.  "
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","Unless you're using an HDHR prime that transcodes everything anyway, the Roku is a crap client bc it doesn't support the native OTA broadcast format MPEG2. Without support for that, in order to support the Roku, the Amazon Recast would be required to transcode all live OTA broadcasts on the fly just to allow the Roku to play them, just like a Plex or Emby server has to do right now. But a Plex or Emby server that can transcode 4 simultaneous HD MPEG2 streams coming in on all 4 tuners in real-time is a hell of a lot more money than what Amazon is selling the 4 Tuner Recast for with all the tuners built into it, and a 1 TB drive. Amazon wisely decided they weren't going to double the price of their recast and degrade live television just to make up for Roku's own lack of capability. For live OTA streaming Roku is junk without native MPEG2 support and that's not Amazon's fault."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",[More info coming](http://www.aftvnews.com/please-bear-with-me/).Edit: see u/08830's post which I missed. This looks like the first article on this.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",[Link to said-post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/9hhl4l/amazon_announces_dvr_fire_tv_recast_updating/)
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","Another attempt to leverage the firetv ecosystem.  Amazon is pretty much the one streaming system I do not have, so I’ll probably go the tablo route.  But maybe this will lead to prices coming down, hopefully including the lifetime service for tablo."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","I just went through this whole decision-tree for our household. What you decide boils down to whether or not you value watching live OTA broadcasts in their native format in real-time with 0 degradation in the video or audio. If you want that then you won't go with a Tablo and you'll probably start getting FireTV devices. The Fire streaming devices support the native MPEG2 stream that is hitting your antenna which makes them ideal playback clients for OTA. Any tuner you use (like HDHR) can send the signal straight to the player the second it receives it without needing to transcode the whole signal into a different format. Roku doesn't support the native broadcast format so it requires a lot of hardware intervention before any OTA broadcast gets onto your TV and everything is slower. Tablo is the same, it just acts like it's own server. You hear Tablo owners talking about how excited they are that it only takes 6s to change channels now instead of 11s. They may be happy, but I wouldn't be. That doesn't work for us. It's because the Tablo is transcoding EVERYTHING it receives OTA and to me this is just ridiculous. It's a beautiful high-quality stream straight off your antenna and you've got a device in the way intercepting it that won't simply just pass the stream to a client on your own network without compressing it and transcoding it first. Then you end up with slow as hell channel changes, you are behind the real-time broadcast, your video quality isn't as good, and you've got this Tablo turning into a space heater it's working so hard all the time. Did you know people are selling aftermarket cooling fans for Tablos now bc they get so hot working so hard all the time?Eventually you'll come to the same conclusion I did that bc the Fire streaming devices support the native broadcast format that they make the most sense as playback clients for OTA. I have an HDHR 4 Tuner Connect sending the native unaltered broadcast feed straight from my antenna, routed through my laptop that's used as a server, and playing back on 3 televisions without any transcoding whatsoever bc the Fire devices don't need transcoding to play it. Channel changes are instant, no buffering, the video quality is outstanding and you wouldn't even realize the laptop was even plugged in it's totally silent and room temperature. I have a 4th TV in the living room that is still on a Roku and playback is slow. It's about 10s between channel changes, if all my devices are on the same channel the Roku is way behind real-time, the video quality is not as good, and my laptop has to work and you'll hear the fan come alive. When you care about OTA television and there's an ideal and cheap playback client out there made by Amazon that's WAY better for OTA playback then you go for it bc it works so much better for that purpose."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",Cheers to Tablo. I've disowned Amazon ever since they decided not to play with Google.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",check out airtv as well.  They just released an update to enable dvr thru a usb connected device.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","If this had a cable card option, that'd be pretty cool."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",I absolutely love my AFTV’s and have 3 of them however this doesn’t interest me in the slightest. I rarely watch over the air content and if I do I tend to watch it on things like iPlayer catchup etc which can be accessed on any device anywhere.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",Interesting. Not what I expected at all.
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices","I know this is the cordcutters sub, but could a cable feed be plugged in to this for the DVR feature? Does it have to be OTA? Or could one tuner do OTA and one do from cable?"
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",It sounds like it would only work for OTA. Typically you need at least a cable card installed in the DVR since most cable tv feeds are encrypted
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices"," I am a huge fan of this. I just switched to DirectvNow, and I am very satisfied with it, but even with DirectvNow, I may consider this device. There have been a few similar products on the market, but I see this Amazon's product really ahead of the rest. I would have preferred if this also doubled as a 'firebox,' with more power than my firestick (that would have been an easy purchase for me). Either way, I appreciate Amazon doing this."
"Amazon announces new Fire TV Recast — DVR for Fire TVs, Echos, and Mobile devices",There are already a number of other systems that let you record OTA broadcasts.

Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,Lobbyists and political contributions. 
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,"Every market that Google entered or tried to enter resulted in some form of fiber being installed. Personal example is OKC. Google announced they were coming and AT&T & Cox went from ""we have no  plans to upgrade...."" to ""OH SHOOT, WE GOT MEN ON THE GROUND RIGHT NOW!!!!""It was like they were working as hard as Google felt like working. They hit downtown. They hit midtown. They hit business areas. They started residential areas........and then Google started announcing they were thinking about wireless internet at fiber speeds........and Cox slowed down rapidly because they knew Google was bullcrapping. AT&T kept going though! THEY ACTUALLY THEN STARTED COMPETING VIA 5G!!! (OKC was one of their first markets they announced has it, so thanks to Google OKC will have 5G)...then Google halted OKC's expansion, and AT&T stopped fiber wise. Cox was already done. My neighborhood was to get AT&T's stuff and I saw the big spindles of fiber. It's delayed now. That's the whole point of the article. Everyone gave a crap because nobody wanted to lose out to Google over this.  It helped small businesses and residents when Google cared. Now that they don't care we're seeing less stories about communities wanting their own municipalities to install fiber or private companies speedly trying to beat Google to fiber. It's a shame. Government ain't goin' step in either so unless Google actually does try their hand at wireless 5G as broadband like T-Mobile and AT&T are gearing up to do we're going to still have communities where fiber isn't an option and will never be one..."

Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,Capitalism is the problem. Nationalizing Comcast is the solution.
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,Comcast was slapped with a dose of reality when Google Fiber entered the Atlanta market.Comcast drastically lowered prices to compete and attempted to offer a half @$$ Gigabit plan.Today in Atlanta Comcast has had to cut prices by 50% in order to compete with Google in the small footprint in which both operate.  Meanwhile those of us in surrounding markets where Comcast holds a monopoly are hideously overcharged for Internet and TV. I relish the day when I can cancel my Comcast internet and move to a another provider.The American consumer is getting screwed by the teleco industry.  I dont care if you label yourself as a Democrat or Republican. Both parties are in bed with the teleco’s lobbyist. I applaud what Google did and is still attempting to do even if it is at a snails pace because of powerline pole right of ways.I currently utilize OTA TV in the Atlanta market.At least one Comcast commercials is on every half  hour it is nauseating.  Comcast knows that newer technology is nipping at their heals and they can not compete.  Comcast can not compete with YouTube TV on picture quality and cost. Google can afford to take a loss on YouTube TV in order to sell eyeballs to the advertisers. The Comcast stock holders will not tolerate losses.With 5g on the doorstep. Comcast will no longer be the only game in town... Good riddance....

Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,"It absolutely helped here in Charlotte, NC. I cant remember the exact time frames but shortly (within several months) after google fiber was announced Time Warner not only increased bandwidth options considerably (it had been the same max speed since it was implemented from what i remember) but they actually increased the speed of the regular tier without increasing the price)  ATT installed fiber in my neighborhood within a year and offered gigibit speeds for $80 a month (and not part of a bundle) I doubt any of those things would have happened if it wasn't for google as TW was willing to sit on the infrastructure  since obviously it was in place for as quick as they rolled it out after the google announcement. ATT had been promoting their fiber option for a couple of years but they had only lit up a few neighborhoods at that point, all of the sudden you see install crews everywhere. The impact may not have spread much beyond the few cities that got picked by google and even in those cities its isnt going to be seen as real competition anymore so I can see both Spectrum and ATT implementing caps or other bullshit down the line. At least for this brief moment in time I have cheap unlimited internet  and I think its a direct result of google.   "

Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,To expensive. They probably thought they would just have to undercut the other provider by a little bit. When they got in the other providers drop their prices so much that it was not remotely cost feasible. Now the question is did they drop their prices low because they could or did they take a loss in order to scare Google into not continuing. 
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,FAILURE . IS . SUCCESS
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,It's a success in my house woo. I love my google fiber.
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,who the fuck says its a failure?
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,"It certainly wasn’t a success. They aborted it before any meaningful or lasting impact could happen, and then came out with some airy-fairy bullshit about fixed wireless. Now, the result is a tiny footprint that will most likely be sold off to an MSO, and a permanently damaged reputation. Does anyone actually believe Alphabet/Google can do any project and see it to completion? They botched Waymo, and I’d lay money on the line that Verizon will be offering actual real fixed home wireless before google ever will."
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,Shoutout to people like me with 18Mbps over two-wire and my buddy 200ft away with 4Mbps
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,"I work in telecom and I'm sure to get downvoted to oblivion here, but the cost of deploying fiber is incredibly expensive. In most cases, too expensive. For a little background, Google bought dark fiber when the internet bubble burst for a fraction of what WorldCom paid, while most companies were trying to stay alive. Google uses a fiber hut strategy to further reduce costs. Google deploys only in dense metro areas with low regulations to maximize profit and avoids high reg states like notorious Virginia PUC. Google hires the best and brightest available. And with all that...Google can't make fiber work. We're going to get there eventually, but I don't think we are going to get gigabit speeds in rural areas anytime in the near future. Why would you develop expensive interstate running to some podunk town? High speed internet is similar. Telecoms will continue to deploy fiber at slow rates because it is incredibly expensive. I'm sure you'll say, ""Well you'll get the money back eventually."" But that isn't a sure thing. Spend billions running fiber to the home and someone sends up microsatellites with gigabit speed and you have to declare bankruptcy. "
Google Fiber's 'Failure' Succeeded In Shining A Light On Pathetic Broadband Competition,"I get that it costs alot, but what did the Telecom companies do with the billions in tax breaks, fcc money, and profits from deregulation? Why are they focusing more on vertical market intergration and 5g instead of fiber roll outs? "
"How to cancel cable with comcast and go internet only? When I call they tell me it will be more expensive to get just internet, and I'm paying $200 a month.","Deal with the account cancellation folks only. Tell them that you're dropping cable and going internet only. Tell them that you can get an internet only deal from their competitor in your area and ask them if they can match whatever new customer price they are offering. I suspect Comcast will give you a discount on internet only before losing you altogether. I was paying $30 for internet with ATT as part of a bundle with cable. Their internet only price was $60. I got them down to $40. If they don't honor that next year, I will switch to their competitor. The important thing to note is that you will definitely save money cutting the cord. I am saving about $85 per month overall. Don't listen to the Comcast reps. They will lie their asses off to keep you. My $0.02 anyway. "

"How to cancel cable with comcast and go internet only? When I call they tell me it will be more expensive to get just internet, and I'm paying $200 a month.",They probably mean more expensive for whatever tier you choose not more expensive than what you’re paying now. I pay ~$65/mo for 60 mbps Internet only from Comcast. If basic TV had been included (no HD) then yes it would’ve been a little cheaper. Out of principle I wanted Internet only. I can stream content to whatever TV I want without worrying about extra equipment charges and BS broadcast and local sports fees.
"How to cancel cable with comcast and go internet only? When I call they tell me it will be more expensive to get just internet, and I'm paying $200 a month.","Totally agree. I cut the cord to save money originally but it turned out that I greatly prefer streaming after all.

"Can't cancel YouTube TV using IE, Edge, ESR Firefox, Safari, etc","I would say it's completely intentional to make it difficult to cancel. Pretty much every service makes it way more difficult to to cancel or downgrade than it is to join or upgrade.    For instance any phone company and cable service (I haven't had one in many years though) will let you join and upgrade all you want online, but make you call them to cancel. I was pissed that I had issues getting AT&T to cancel one of my lines and had to keep calling and sitting on hold four different times until they finally terminated the line. If it was just an option online it probably would just be a seem less one time online visit to get it done.    I guess we should probably be grateful they at least let you use chrome to cancel and don't make you call and give you the mandatory sales pitch."
"Can't cancel YouTube TV using IE, Edge, ESR Firefox, Safari, etc","> you cannot cancel your YouTube TV membership from a device or browser that will not allow you to watch YouTube TV.This seems obvious to me.  If the device or browser cannot let you access YoutubeTV then logically that device/browser will not let you access your account (and cancel) either.- Of course if a service absolutely will not let you cancel, you can call your credit card company and dispute the charge (explaining that you tried to cancel but the company refuses to comply)"

DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"I second this. I brought my equipment to UPS, watched them scan each item into DirecTV's system, and they then provided me a receipt to prove that I returned the equipment. I watched them put all the equipment into a single box for shipping. I spent the next few months battling with them because they claimed they received some of my equipment but not all of it. They proceeded to charge me about $300 for a no-return fee. Finally after about the 3rd time calling them and giving them the confirmation numbers on my receipt I had the charge removed. "
DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"Damn.... my experience cancelling Dish was smoother, they even offered to see if any loyalty credits could apply, but they couldn't get lower than DTVN.  Took a while to get the return kit.&#x200B;I was also happy to see that they *didn't* charge me an additional month, and actually cut my current balance in half!"
DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,Ditto when my brother canceled Dish.  No problems at all.  Dish appears to be more customer-friendly than Directv.
DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"They are just terrific aren't they?  I cancelled DirecTV on September 3rd and switched to Hulu Live + Philo.  Guess what happened last week?  They did an electronic withdrawal from our account for the **full** amount.  I checked the bill this week and found out that they charged us for the full month even though we cancelled 13 days before the end of the billing cycle.I called last night.CSR #1 -  she was with UVerse even though I called the number on the DirecTV bill and told the automated system I wanted billing.  Transferred me to DirecTV.CSR #2 - she was with DirecTV but when I told her they overcharged me after cancelling she notified me that my account was not cancelled and was still active even though I told her their website specifically showed our account as cancelled and I had email confirmation they received my equipment.  Transferred me to their cancellation department.CSR #3 - explained all the same crap over again and what I had been told.  She told me she needed to put me on hold.  No hold music and could hear something in the background.  Still no music.  Said ""Really?  I don't think anyone put me on hold or anything.  This is weird""  Suddenly hold music.  Comes back to tell me our account is in their RC1 system and she doesn't have access to that system.  Transferred me to another CSR.CSR #4 - explained all the same crap over **AGAIN**.  Seemed to know nothing about the RC1 system or wouldn't acknowledge the other rep said anything about it.  Confirmed the account was cancelled.  Realized we were indeed charged for the full month and will send out a refund.  Send out?  Yes, they can **TAKE** your money electronically but not refund it back.  We should get a check in 2-3 weeks.All that took just over an hour.  They're awful.  We'll see if a check really arrives in the mail."

DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"My experience cancelling was actually really good. The conversation went like this:Me: ""I'm moving and wish to cancel my DirecTV service.""Rep: ""so you're moving and do not want to take the service with you? Ok let's take care of that.""And that's it. No pitch, no transfer to retention. I was shocked after hearing all he horror stories."
DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"I found it easier to tell them I am moving in with my parents who are already DTV customers. They will ask for how long (hoping to talk you into suspending your account), just tell them permanently. At this point they really don’t have any “save” options and will close your account. "
DirecTV is horrible when trying to cancel.,"I had to cancel my Dad's service when he went to an assisted living facility.  Once DTV understood we couldn't transfer his service it was a decent experience dealing with them.So when I cancelled DTV a while back I told them I was going to a home and couldn't transfer service...piece of cake cancelling and they were really nice (while wife was laughing her ass off next to me).If you even hint you are going to a competitor's service while trying to cancel, I guarantee it will be a horrible experience."

I was then paying for PS Vue and Amazon Prime. For UVerse internet and PS Vue I was over $100 and did not get all of the content I wanted.You are paying less than that for a bundled service. Under $100 seems really reasonable to me. I switched back to AT&T about 13 months ago and have U300, 1 DVR, 2 wireless boxes, and 50Mbps internet for $105 per month ($115 after tax).

"Loki, Scarlet Witch to Get TV Series on Disney Streaming Service – Variety","A bit off topic.  I find it interesting that TV/streaming shows that are supposedly in the MCU (Agents of Shield, Daredevil and others) never seem to influence any of the movies much.  In fact, I don't recall ever seeing  references towards any MCU series in the movies (e.g. Was there any mention of Agent Coulson after the first Avengers movie?).  There are plenty of references to the movies on the shows, but never the other way around.&#x200B;Anyways, I hope these series will be different.  It would certainly make them carry more weight and importance.  &#x200B;Disclaimer:  I haven't watched every MCU show (like I never finished Luke Cage or Iron Fist), so perhaps I'm missing something."

Another huge factor, each month movies come and go.  4-5 of the top 250 left at the start of September, while 7-8 of the top 250 were added.

Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,"I'm actually wondering what people are expecting from them. The bigger thread on this on whatever subreddit yesterday was full of people slagging on how far Netflix has fallen and how bad it is now.Yet the article says that this is actually a bit better than two years ago, and the apparent high point four years ago was still under 20%. It seems weird to take these numbers as proof that Netflix is dying or whatever.Honestly, since I can't watch 250 movies at the same time, I'm pretty much okay with a steaming service that has films rotating through, where I can see a decent chunk of the great movies at any given time. 10+% of the top 250 feels like it's decent enough. That doesn't mean that the rotation is good enough, or that everything is awesome, but this just isn't an area I'm unhappy with Netflix over.The UI autoplaying constantly is a much bigger thorn in my side."
Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,"There is so much new content coming out that it makes up the vast majority of their viewing hours.  There’s no way a data driven company like Netflix doesn’t calculate exactly how much per viewing hour each item costs them.  I’m sure they hang on to a few that are a net loss just to keep their selection up but not too many. If you want to watch a movie repeatedly there are tons of purchase options, they don’t need to focus there.  I would much rather have the full series of a TV show available.  The new UI auto play is beyond awful.  I have been actively avoiding Netflix since it was implemented and watching Hulu or Amazon instead. If they don’t fix it I may cancel entirely.  I don’t want my TV screaming at me when I am browsing content."

Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,Exactly.  I probably watch over 100 tv episodes for every movie I even look up.
Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,"Is this a problem? The very first sentence seems to sum up the reasons why pretty quickly:> From now through Christmas, Netflix is slated to release an unprecedented amount of original movies.What this says to me is taht Netflix is spending their money on making new content instead of paying contracts on getting old shows and movies.

Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,"They have some pretty big movies coming that are gathering buzz as well. A movie from Alfonso Cuaron, the Coen Brothers, and from Gareth Evans(The Raid) seems like they're at least trying to do something about it."
Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,"I'm not as impressed with Netflix' product, but there's no question that rising demand for streaming content was driving up the contract price for existing desirable movies.

There are lots of movies on that list that, while regarded as masterpieces in the cultural zeigest, I have no desire personally to sit down and watch again. I havent wanted to watch To Kill a Mockingbird or Into the Wild since I saw them in highschool English class. And while everyones tastes are different, Im sure lots of people would be just as happy with Netflix picking up the latest RomCom or Marvel Action movie as they would them paying big fees to keep Schindler's list"
Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,">I would rather watch something new instead of classics that I have seen dozens of times over the last 40+ years.Parents spend a lot of time showing their kids old content for nostalgia, or just because it's quality content their kids have never seen.

Netflix Only Has 35 Movies from the IMDB Top 250 List in Its US Streaming Library,At least Blockbuster had an isle of classic movies that had the best 50 films from  1945 -1970.  Netflix seems to just have every Marvel spinoff that someone can get the rights to film.

A guy at best buy told me the situation was pretty grim, and pretty much any antenna they sold at the store was going to get me next to nothing. I was hoping there was something somewhat affordable I could mount on the roof, but not sure it's worth the hassle, or even possible by the sound of things. "
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,"I don't think BBCA has next day episodes on regular Hulu, if that's what you mean.  Probably the best way to go is to add Philo for the next couple of months.  Or buy it on iTunes. ETA: Or you could sub to PS Vue, DTVN or Sling instead. They all have BBCA. "
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,"Pity. Yes I have DTVN but they recently raised $5/month and I think they're considering raising it again soon so I'm looking for alternatives and Hulu Live seems like the next best thing for me, but I do love my Doctor Who."
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,Not sure if it's available in your area but YouTube TV carries BBC America as well. 
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,"Unfortunately YTTV doesnt work on the devices I want (either Fire TV or PS4) last time I checked, unless that changed?"
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,PS Vue carries BBC America and would run on both of your devices
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,But that's $45/month so it'd be the same price as DTVN anyway :(
Thinking on switching to Hulu Live. Will I be able to watch Doctor Who the next day on Hulu?,FuboTV has BBC America

Help with AirTV 2 (black box) - Getting wrong channel information,"Is there a place in the software to list your location or zip code? If so, make sure it is correct. Other than that, you are relying on the channel guide information provider to be accurate. With my ChannelMaster DVR+, I at first had incorrect guide info for just one channel. I contacted them to find out who the channel guide provider they used was. Then I contacted that company with the correction. They promised to look at it, and in about 2 weeks it was corrected. The fact that many of your channels are mussed up makes this seem less likely to be the problem. I would double-check your location and then keep bugging AirTV support."
Help with AirTV 2 (black box) - Getting wrong channel information,I haven't thought about asking about the channel guide provider. That's something I could look into.
Help with AirTV 2 (black box) - Getting wrong channel information,I had a similar issue with one of my OTA channels. I ended up switching the zip code from my home zip code to another in my market and it fixed my issue. So maybe try using a different zip from another city in your market. 
Help with AirTV 2 (black box) - Getting wrong channel information,"That's a good point. Are you talking about the zip code that is listed under the personal information section on the account information page? I checked my account and under my personal information, it had a different zip code listed. It had my billing zip code which is different from where I actually live. I went ahead and updated it so I will have to see what happens when I get home later."
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","That’s not a bad price actually, now is that regular price or a special that will increase at the end of the offer?  When I cut to internet only I dropped from $214 to $95 all in. $80 for internet and $15 for my live tv service, between my live tv service, a couple apps and my OTA antenna, there really isn’t anything I can’t watch. If you are renting your modem you can shave about $11  a month off your bill by purchasing your own modem and router. I’ve always owned my own, and always will. As far as not liking Comcast, I’m with ya there, but I will say their internet is rock solid unfortunately lol, atleast in my area. 1 way you may look at it is, with the channels you have and the channels you want, how much would it cost thru Comcast, vs dropping to internet only and picking up a streaming service. If the price between the 2 is still pretty much neck in neck ya might as well stay with what you have unfortunately. Now as another poster said check and see what you can pick up OTA, I currently can pull 22 local channels. "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","That's the actual price. Not a promo. They and Verizon are competing HARD in our area right now.

At least until they start raising the price. Thanks for the feedback. "

"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","I'll have to look into that. Last time I checked, it was $100 for the basic TV and the 100Mb connection. Them early termination fees though..."
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","'Cord Cutting' means different things to different people; but i think we all agree it means getting rid of cable or satellite TV.  But to me, that's just trading one cord for another; like you said, Sling, PS Vue, YTTV, and others offer the same thing, but through a different technology (the internet).  IMO, we have gone nowhere other than provide more competition with DISH, DirectTV, Comcast, and more.  It's a good thing, because it drives down competition, but I think that the original goal (at least for me) was to force someone to offer a pricing model that includes a-la-carte channel lineups based on our preferences.Upon reading your concerns, I decided to do a quick analysis of my Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) since cutting the cord (which I will provide in the next paragraph) based on my memory and available records.  I concluded that Over-the-Air (OTA) is definitely the way to go.  \*Note that when I was a DISH customer, I was also a Netflix and Amazon Prime customer, so I did not take those costs into account for this analysis since I do not view it as an 'additional' cord-cutting expense; I would have subscribed to those whether or not I cut the cord.  Same thing goes for my internet service: it's not an 'additional cost' so I don't count it.During my time as a DISH Network customer, I never modified my plan.  However, prices slowly rose from 29.99/mo up to $54.99/mo over the course of my 41 months as their customer.  The reason I cancelled was because I received notification it was raising to $59.99/mo.  The average cost of ownership was $40.41 per month, with TCO of $1657.09 sunk into DISH network (including installation fees, taxes, DVR service, etc).  At the end of that service, I had nothing to show for all that sunk cost, I had to ship back the DVR and satellite dish.  Since I cut the cord it has been 40 months.  At first I bought a cheap Antenna ($30), a TabloTV with lifetime subscription service (equip+service=$350), and a Roku TV ($199).  For that initial $580 startup cost, I had pretty much lifetime OTA HDTV with no extra cost forever (or, until they update the signals to something my tablo can't decode, which will likely be a minimum of 20 years, but likely more).  Thus TCO for this cord-cutting setup = $580 and the average cost per month to-date is $14.50 (this number will get smaller as i continue to incur $0 in service fees for OTA).But I think this is a bit of a deceiving number, because after that initial setup, I sunk more costs in equipment to better use my new 'free' service.  These costs are all completely optional, but recommended.  I upgraded from a 2-tuner Tablo to a 4-Tuner Tablo ($299, but I didn't have to pay another subscription fee).  I upgraded from a 32"" TV to a 55"" TV ($510).  I upgraded to a better omnidirectional Mohu Sky60 antenna ($89) so that I could get more channels (went up from 22 channels to 55 channels).  I kept misplacing Roku remotes so I bought 4 more ($40), and while I was at it, went ahead and bought another 65"" HDR Roku TV ($699).  When you take all these additional costs into consideration, my TCO is $2448 with an average monthly cost of $61; however I have LOTS of stuff to show for it since it's all MINE.  &#x200B;So if you decide to go this route, take this lesson from me and buy the best equipment right off the bat.  I wanted to 'ease' into it; Tablo was fairly new, and back in 2014 Smart TVs were pretty dumb.  But now its a proven concept that works; I've been using it reliably for 4 years now."
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","I really appreciate the breakdown. Since our TV package is basically free (just internet is the same price), so I think I'm going to stick with what i have until they start raising the prices. Thanks again though. That was awesome to read. "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","You are one of the lucky ones. Honestly, if my cable company was even close to Internet only + PS Vue + Tablo, I'd consider switching back, if only for the convenience. But I'm not going to pay more than twice as much for it. (I have no choices in providers or the HD fees, the sports fees, the local access fees and the fees for their crappy encrypted digital equipment that go with their cable.) "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...",That's what I'm gathering. I guess I can deal with comcast if they aren't gouging me. 
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","I have Mediacom internet (100mbps) for $51/month. I’m using Directv Now for $40. I am using a friend’s Netflix account. And I have Amazon Prime so I get that video. We came from Directv and ATT U-Verse Internet (which was only 50mbps but never got that). Without the 2-year contract, it was going upwards to around $150/month or more really. I can’t stand AT&T, hence why I dropped their internet. But my only option is ATT and Mediacom. Directv Now is ok for now cause it has the best channel lineup but I’m not a HUGE fan. I just deal with it. "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","We are definitely saving money for our desired. My main requirements for TV are being able to watch live sports (mainly college football, MLB, and Premier League soccer) and have DVR capabilities. Before we cut the cord, we had DirecTV, but the price was way too high. We still had internet, and Netflix and Amazon anyway, so we needed a way to get what we wanted from TV without paying the $80/month that we were on top of the internet service and streaming services we had. Youtube TV has been great. We're grandfathered in at $35/month, and it gives us everything we want. We did have Chromecast and Amazon FireTV sticks, but upgraded recently to Roku Ultra to get a better remote and more reliable hardware performance. That investment easily pays off in the long run. "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...",I'd guess you don't have a dvr. If I could pay a bit more for that deal w/a dvr I'd also stick with the local cable bundle deal. I currently spend $104 for yttv and my internet which sucks at 30/3 speeds.
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","Your price is very good, we were paying $150 for internet and one hddvr box when we cancelled.

"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","- Your cost could be $0.00 if you use nothing but over-the-air (like my parents).  - In my setup I supplement the free OTA with $8/month Hulu and free websites like cwtv.com, fox.com, etc.  My internet is only 15/month via Verizon DSL.

"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","I'd really like to keep access to cartoons on demand, so keeping the internet is a must.

How is your streaming quality with DSL? "
"Wanting to cut the cord, but I have some questions concerning total costs...","Your cost is at the lower end of what I've seen, but you still pay almost three times what we do (excluding the internet connection cost which we would have anyway).Still, I'd advise anyone who isn't prepared to go full war with their cable company just to keep their service. You do lose things. And you must be prepared to ignore those losses and accept your monthly cash consolation prize.I cringe when I see some dumb ass politician making claims ""cable is a choice"". That said...it's still very true. No one needs this stuff.OTA TV is just as junky as cable, but you'll be surprised how competitive they've become since the digital changeover. Honestly never imagined them taking the initiative - but they did.Internet service quality varies quite a bit, but I would always try the lowest level first. If you have any problems, hunt down a router with Qualcomm's Streamboost first. Might be hard to find - but matters. Especially if it saves you money with your internet connection."

Looking for rural antenna advice - is this setup overkill?,"The gray channels are the ones predicted to be not receivable with *any* antenna. I am curious why you think the linked RCA ANT751, which is a low performance antenna, might be overkill. Are you attempting this from indoors?TV Fool is fairly messed up these days due to the channel repack. You can try this site instead to get an idea of what all might be available:* https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmapsYou can see what is transmitted from each transmitter here:* https://rabbitears.info/market.php?mktid=203You are probably interested to see what K14IU is transmitting because the FCC site doesn't list those type of transmitters (translators) and the TV Fool site doesn't show what they are transmitting.Added: I just noticed that K08PR is also sending PBS, which might be of special interest as it is in the green, indoor reception, range. So you might just need rabbit ears..."
Looking for rural antenna advice - is this setup overkill?,"Thank you for the information. I tried one of the stick-to-the-window antennas and was only able to get 3 channels: CBS, meTV, and some old movie station (those last two are the K14IU signal). From what I read, it seemed that I needed to upgrade to an outdoor antenna in order to get PBS, so I suppose my question of overkill is more related to that than to the antenna I linked being low performance - is an outdoor setup necessary, or can I still pull this off indoors? We have harsh winds and winters, so inside would be much better, if it works."
Looking for rural antenna advice - is this setup overkill?,"Have you tried the PBS app on streaming devices like Roku or Amazon Fire?

Looking for rural antenna advice - is this setup overkill?,">  If the grey channels are a possibility with a different setup at similar cost, that would be good to know beforehand.It may be possible to catch the gray channels on the backside of the antenna (real channels 5,  5, and 3, from about 300 degrees).But they're blocked by mountains in between you and the transmitted and you would need a larger antenna that can receive low VHF channels, which requires very long dipoles.So it's probably better to focus on the PBS station plus the stations that are 16 miles away from you at 95 degrees.Since many of your stations are high-VHF, you may want to think about the Clearstream 2 MAX which has a high-VHF dipole."
Looking for rural antenna advice - is this setup overkill?,"Thanks, I'll look into that antenna."

Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,"There’s a lot of quality disparity between tuners. HDHR (I own) tuner is generally FAR better than TV cheap built-ins. I’d kill the splitter and just run unsplit coax to HDHR. Then share that throughout entire house using Powerline. (Wifi can sometimes be used successfully, depending on your situation.) At Visio, assuming no Visio HDHR client (I don’t know), just use Fire TV or cheap Android TV box to run HDHR client software (aka HDHR Viewer). "
Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,"I’m not sure what it is, but I seem to get a much brighter, cleaner picture with the direct to TV. I’ve got a Shield as the HDHR client. "
Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,"Not sure what you mean by ""shared"". If you mean that the transmitter has subchannels, that should not make any difference. It is all just a bit stream and everything is digital at the subchannel level.Is is possible that you are receiving a somewhat messed up signal from that transmitter? If you have not yet done so, you might want to carefully adjust the rotation of the antenna to peak the reception of the bad channel on the bad TV. Also check that your antenna is perfectly vertical as such antennas are very directional. You might want to try things without the powered splitter as a test."
Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,MyNetworkTV and FOX are sharing the same signal & real channel (UHF-25) but have different virtual channels (12-1 and 46-1).  This is becoming more common across the country.
Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,I’m not necessarily sure either - the Wikipedia entry for the fox affiliate WJZY saysChannels	Digital: 47 (UHF)(shared with WMYT-TV; to move to 25 (UHF))Virtual: 46 (PSIP)
Do some tuners have issues with shared signals?,Shared channels just means both stations operate on the same channel as subchannels with different virtual channel numbers but retain individual broadcast licenses.  This practice has actually been around for a long time where you might get 2 channels that have transmitters in different locations have a subchannel for the other one in order to increase their coverage area (In fact it looks like there are a couple that do that in the Charlotte area: WSOC-CR and WSOC-ST).  So sharing a channel should not affect reception.
"Just called to cancel Directv, but got strange instructions on sending the equipment back","I just did this last week, went to a FedEx store and they check in all the equipment.  They have an agreement with AT&T to send equipment back at no cost to you.  AT&T will email you a packing list to bring to FedEx/UPS and they'll take care of everything.  I would hold onto your tracking information they give you to ensure the package is sent back to AT&T."

That next week we got a bill for the full amount because it was for the month prior.  Not doubting you just wondering if we paid something we shouldn't have paid!Anyways to add to the main topic - yes they will scan everything.  You will also get an email as soon as they receive the equipment.**Don't forget to return the power cords and remote controls!**  When they scan everything they mark a checkbox saying that you included all the items with it."

"Just called to cancel Directv, but got strange instructions on sending the equipment back",You'll be good. UPS will straight up scan the barcode on the machine and know where to send it.

As others have mentioned, KEEP your receipt, tracking number, and maybe even snap a pic or two on your phone of everything you took into the ups store.

"Just called to cancel Directv, but got strange instructions on sending the equipment back","It's good to be wary.  My problem-free experience: I was a long term ~ 20 yr DTV customer. When I called DTV to cancel in early June, DTV said they would send me a shipping box and instructions. Shortly before my scheduled terminitation date, the box arrived. I packed the DTV equipment, took a picture of the equipment in the box, sealed the box and took it to a UPS store. I was given a tracking receipt.  After a couple of weeks I received an email from DTV that they had received the equipment. Done."
"Just called to cancel Directv, but got strange instructions on sending the equipment back","Yes, that's what happened to me with DISH network.  I guess they're having a lot of people ship their stuff back because no one wants to deal with their shit anymore, so they set up contracts with the shipping companies to make it easier.  "
Anyone know what Carson shows Antenna Network broadcasts?,"Didnt they show full shows containing Burt Reynolds the week of his death. I think all i have seen are full shows.

"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Yeah we constantly see criticism of Netflix's volume approach compared to HBO but this has been a common theme recently. Netflix has a lot of garbage but there's quality there you just need to pay attention. 
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Atypical is a fantastic half hour comedy and I bet most never even heard of it.  Many things get lost in that terrible Netflix UI
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Never even heard of that Maisel show and i been watching alot of series the past few years
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",It is really good. You should watch it.
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Highly recommend. Its funny and a beautiful production all-around 
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",I don't know how you missed it?  Amazon advertised Maisel every time I opened their Video app.  (More recently they keep advertising their Jack Ryan show over... and over... and over.)
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Have prime? 
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",The past few years? Ha. I’ve been watching series for the past 30 years.

"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","I am glad for Netflix and Amazon! This kind of strong presence is key for cord cutters. Also, can Netflix ""compete"" in foreign markets the same way? I mean, nominate their international shows in their respective countries' awards?I think that it can only help Netflix if they continue growing their presence in other markets. I know I have enjoyed many of their international offerings.I am also so happy for Amy Sherman-PalladinoI love her writing style, she combines the old-school fast paced talk with a modern sensibility that works really well for me.The loving way she shows the whole comedy scene in NYC shows her ties to it, but at the same time, she doesn't ignore the grittier aspects of that life. kudos to her!"
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",award shows are meaningless
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","For us, sure, but not for the industry."
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","Am I the only person who doesn't care for the streaming originals? I've watched a few, but ultimately none hold a candle to the network shows. Obviously this is just my opinion, but why are they all such drivel?I'm a big fan of shows like The Office, Brooklyn Nine Nine, HIMYM.... can anyone direct me to the light?Edit: to be clear, I don't really care for dramas. They just don't do it for me. I especially don't care for the Uber violent/sexy dramas, as I prefer to watch TV with my kid in the room.Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt was ok, and I thought Red Oaks was dumb. I've heard ""F is for Family"" is pretty good, I think I'll give it a shot."
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","I’ve lost count of the original content I’ve watched that’s been outstanding.Currently watching Ozark (brilliant) but Narcos, Mindhunter, House of Cards, Stranger Things. I could go on and on. "
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","I think the best Netflix originals are their dramas like Ozark, Narcos, Mindhunter.  They have a couple decent comedies though.  Master of None is pretty funny/awkward.  GLOW is pretty good.  I liked American Vandal, I heard the 2nd season is good too.  They also have a few really good animated shows, Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and F is for Family."
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",I prefer the network sitcoms too.  I haven't found a streaming original sitcom that I think is nearly as good.There is good stuff on streaming. There just isn't a lot of traditional sitcom material.You should watch Ms. Maisel on Amazon. It's still not a traditional sitcom but it's funny and really good.
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","Bojack Horseman, F is for Family. Not a whole lot of live action sitcoms, though. I legit can't think of one."
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",I believe the shows you listed are done in a different style than what is on Netflix. I forget what it's called but it's kinda live studio audience vs not. 
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","There aren't that many shows that I'd put in the same sort of style as the ones you list there, but the closest would probably be Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix, and Ghosted on Hulu."
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’",Ozark is great 
"HBO & Netflix In Historic Emmy Tie After ‘Game Of Thrones’ Win, Amazon Has Big Night With ‘The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel’","Not traditional sitcoms but..The Tick is fucking great. Red Oaks was pretty good.Mrs. Maisel is solid, but it's more of a period drama that happens to be a woman doing stand up comedy. She runs into Lenny Bruce a couple times and everything. Everything else I've found on Amazon is drama, Jack Ryan.  Sneaky Pete. Bosch. Goliath.Edit-- As far as people saying this or that about traditional sitcoms.. it should be noted, afaik, there's just not a whole lot being made with longevity on networks even right now. Two of the three you named ended long ago. The only really popular one's I can think of are modern family and big bang theory, which is on its last season.They brought back Roseanne.. then immediately cancelled cuz , super duper surprise, she offended.. but they're desperate to hit an audience with such material, so they're bringing back the show sans Roseanne."

"Is there a list of content available for Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon?",Roku tries to provide this through voice search using the remote. So far it's been better than moreflicks and CanIStreamIt.

Lost Cause for Antenna?,"I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it won't be easy. Honestly I'd look into if there's any local professionals in your area that can help you."
Lost Cause for Antenna?,Well how much do you like PBS? :) You have a PBS transmitter (NJTV) right in town. Other than that you don't really seem to have anything that could be classed as a local.It looks like you might be in a valley or some other low spot with no close transmitters. The only other popular networks TV Fool thinks you have even a slight chance of getting are in the VHF-high band. That would be an antenna like this:* Stellar Labs 30-2476
Lost Cause for Antenna?,post in the tvfool forum.  They are pretty helpful and very responsive.
Lost Cause for Antenna?,Look around the neighborhood for rooftop antennas and see what types are up.  Ask those neighbors what channels they get and about pixelation etc.I bet you'll see some big winegards and channel masters up high on chimneys or even on towers with rotors.
Lost Cause for Antenna?,"Good point, I haven't seen a neighbor with an antenna."
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),"75 feet of coax will reduce your signal by about 4.25 dBi, leaving you with about 37.5% of signal.   You may wish to put in an amplifier at your antenna to negate the cable loss. "
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),That might be the path of least resistance before i start playing with other antennas and different positions.  Honestly i feel the issue is mostly  with the TV tuner.  The Tivo held the signal much better.  
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),"Try turning off electronics, including LED and CFL lights, to check for interference.Consider a roof or attic antenna."
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),Ill try the LEDs (they are also Hue bulbs). Otherwise ill look at attic or chimney mount.
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),Are you splitting the coax line at all? Is it quad-shielded RG6? You can also try an antenna amplifier. 
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),No splits.
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),"NBC in New York is actually not a VHF channel. The virtual channel is 4.1 but the [physical channel is 36](https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&callsign=73333#station) (UHF).It's hard to say how to improve your reception without knowing your location, height, etc. You can try putting the antenna on a window if you haven't already. Experiment with placing the antenna at different locations."
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),"Thanks, i must of crossed my wires regarding UHF vs VHF.  Window mount won't pass the WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor).  I'll play with a few more posistitions otherwise i'll look to roof mounted.  Not sure attic is worth it since i also have solar panels."
Issues w/ VHF Channel (NBC - NY),"If you have roku,the locast app features by ota channels.free."
Going back to Cable?,Make sure Uverse doesn’t charge you extra for equipment or dvr and hd fees.
Going back to Cable?,I have. It ends up at roughly $105 total. &#x200B;
Going back to Cable?,"If this is like the deal they did for me last year, they had no fees for HD, DVR, or equipment rental for up to 4 TVs.They're pretty desperate."
Going back to Cable?,"When I had Uverse, the internet speeds were shit."
Going back to Cable?,I wanted to try to switch from DirecTV and Comcast to UVerse for internet and TV and this is the reason I didn't. The price was fine but the speed is crappy slow.
Going back to Cable?,"You never left cable.  Choosing instead to stream a cable channel bundle over the internet instead of delivered by traditional means.  That is were a significant amount of costs lie.Cut the cord for real.  Put an antenna, and by your own list, you could be saving a significant amount of money.   And don't forget, that Uverse fee package doesn't include other fees and taxes that get added on as soon as you choose a cable bundle. "
Going back to Cable?,"Yeah, this. Back when I cut the cord it was to save money. I pay for Netflix and Hulu, and my wife has prime for non video reasons. We find it's plenty. If we want to legally get something like GOT or something, we'll get HBO for a short time and binge he hell out of it.    When everyone was excited about the Sling type services I was just like, umm, it's the same deal over a different cable...? Sure, it costs slightly less, but you're still paying for 95% of stuff you don't want.    And honestly, internet is a utility cost. IMO, don't count it when you calculate cord cutting costs. Just how I feel about it. But I get they give you deals that include internet that may be too good to pass up sometimes."
Going back to Cable?,Are you locked in for multiple years (years 2 onward at a higher price)?
Going back to Cable?,"Locked in for 1 year at that price. It goes up after that, but not a 2 year contract."
Going back to Cable?,What are you going to get for speeds with Uverse? I mean its bonded pair dsl.
Going back to Cable?,It is the internet 75 so up to 75 Mbps&#x200B;
Going back to Cable?,"Is there anything you specifically watch that needs live TV streaming or are there specific programs that are ""must have""? A simple Hulu plan would easily cut >$30 off of that, you just won't get live TV. Without more detail it's impossible to say."
Going back to Cable?,so currently we have the directv now go big grandfathered rate. Hulu and Youtube TV are both missing viacom channels which I wont switch to them because of that. I kind of feel trapped because of the price I am currently getting.&#x200B;
Going back to Cable?,And then after the year is up what does the price go up to...
Going back to Cable?,"It's only a 1 yr contract, so he can simply cancel when it goes up.Honestly, if Comcast ever got the Instant TV / Stream app fully able to replace a cable box, I would go back in a second."
Going back to Cable?,Are there hidden fees for equipment rentals or local fees? Different taxes? 
Going back to Cable?,"If I were to get more TV receivers than just the 1, it would be $10 each which drives me crazy. Currently looking for ways around that."
Going back to Cable?,"For each person it is different.  I have looked at AT&T, but they did not seem any better than the other offerings.  I should note we do no subscribe to an OTT Live service, just Netflix (T-Mobile pays for it), Amazon, and Hulu (now through our son's college subscription).  Every now and then we subscribe to a live service for playoffs, but most of the time we do not."
Going back to Cable?,"when i had uverse (internet only), the price was *supposed* to be locked in, but they found ways to fuck me over a lot. New fees showed up fairly frequently, I wasn't on auto pay for reasons, so they kept changing my due date, moving it forward a few days, so when I was eventually late with a payment, not only did they charge a late fee, they added a reconnect fee. I went through the hassle of getting that taken off twice before I pretty much told them to eff off and cancelled and switched. "
Going back to Cable?,"I ended up doing something similar last year.  UVerse is pretty desperate for subscribers, so it could end up being good.One thing to be careful of is that AT&T will sometimes give you a promo rate for 1 year, but force you to sign a 2 year contract.  This is more common with DirecTV than Uverse TV, but it does still happen sometimes with Uverse TV.Also, be careful about the internet connection. If they're offering 50Mbps or less, you're probably going to end up on a shitty DSL connection where you'll be extremely lucky to get anywhere close to the advertised speed.  This is why I didn't cry too many tears when they didn't have service at my new address and I got let out of my contract.  If they're offering 100Mbps or more, that is most likely a fiber connection, so you'll likely be OK.One more tip:  Go to your local post office and get a change of address packet before you sign up.  AT&T likes to put their ads in there, with promo codes that will help you score additional benefits like extra Visa gift cards back."
Going back to Cable?,Yea. They offered me $250 in Visa cards. It’s definitely tempting seeing as I saw directv now is already talking about future price hikes.

You can buy better quality TVs but not at the price of the TCL and it is the best smart TV OS and second place is far far behind. "

The big deal is thunder storms price,"I've had Fubo for a while and use it on an Apple TV 4K. It's great. The account works with many tv network apps (even though Fubo has on demand content in-app). Doesn't bother me, but just know that they don't carry espn. For me, that only matters for monday night football. Even then, I only care for some matchups. Fubo does have NFL Network, which airs MNF replays. These air early Tuesday morning. I typically DVR the game if I'm interested (due to my schedule) and watch Tuesday night. Other than that, NFL games airing on local channels are carried by Fubo. RedZone is there too. I like the balance they've managed to achieve between sports and other entertainment. No live streaming service is perfect, but Fubo is solid. I've also tried Hulu with Live TV, Vue, and YouTube TV. These are awesome options too, but I decided to go with Fubo because my NY Rangers are on MSG Network. "

Dad is thinking about dropping Direct Tv and getting smart TVs and cutting the cord. Any suggestions on what we should get. The big deal is thunder storms price,"To clarify your self-post... Roku is a streaming box, not a streaming service. Hulu and Fubo are streaming services you use through your Roku or other streaming box.Don't buy a TV based on its smart features. Those features are stuck in time, limited by internal hardware that cannot be upgraded. Whereas, external Roku boxes have new editions come out every 12 to 18 months that are faster and with more features. You upgrade (buy a new one) when you're ready, typically every 2 years, but really don't need to unless a new channel is only available on newer boxes.Step 1. Find out what streaming services contain the TV shows and sports teams you want.Step 2. Confirm the streaming box you want supports all of those apps/channels.Streaming boxes in general:1. Roku - easiest/simplest interface, most widely used. 2. AppleTV - best for integration with your other Apple devices.3. Chromecast - best if you really, really want to use your cell phone as a remote and cast stuff from phone to TV. Not good if you want to use a TV remote by touch memory. 4.

Doesn't have an official Youtube app. Best used only if you really know what you're doing.I'm biased against any streaming box except the top four. Lesser used boxes are less likely to have a comprehensive selection of channels/apps, and will be slower to receive new channels... channel developers focus on creating apps for the most-used devices first."

The big deal is thunder storms price,"Based one what you wrote it sounds like a very bad idea.  You love sports which is going to demand sports packaging.  That is not going to happen with 1 streaming service.  Plus your parents like hbo and showtime.  That will demand subscriptions over and above a streaming service.  So just based on what you have listed you will need the mlb package at $130 per year ($11) per month, nbc sports epl which I think is $60 ($5 per month) and you should be ok for college football over the air if you live local to uga.  HBO and Showtime are both about $15 per month as well so just in that alone you are up to $46 per month with literally nothing else.  So then you add a streaming service for $25-50 per month dependent on what you are wanting and you are already up to about what it costs for monthly cable plus you have to go through the cost and hassle of getting streaming devices, hooking it up and all of that.&#x200B;Alot of this is very dependent on what your needs are and situation but the bottom line is that cord cutting is not necessarily for everyone and doesn't necessarily save money.

"[Question] Two TV's, same antenna, same placement... different reception?","That sort of thing is pretty common with indoor reception. Different tuners deal with the sort of wonky signals you get in that situation, differently.How close is the TV to the antenna? Since TVs are digital devices they have the possibility to produce interference at TV frequencies, no matter how good the shielding is."
"[Question] Two TV's, same antenna, same placement... different reception?",Different tuner. 
"[Question] Two TV's, same antenna, same placement... different reception?","i don't get it... people go crazy over analyzing and reviewing every little aspect of TVs (see https://www.rtings.com/tv ), and after doing a ton of research I bought this TV which apparently can't get reception as well as my 10-year-old TV. What gives? I can return the new TV I bought, but how can I ensure that any other TV I buy will have a tuner that works like my old TV?"
"[Question] Two TV's, same antenna, same placement... different reception?","I have a similar issue. Both TVs are LGs, purchases about a year apart. The smaller TV in the bedroom gets perfect reception. The larger TV in the living room has lots of trouble with TV reception, even though we live pretty close to the towers and have a good antenna. It had the same trouble in the last place we lived, so I'm assuming that the TV just has a bad tuner. Thankfully, we rarely use the antenna."
"[Question] Two TV's, same antenna, same placement... different reception?","Your new TV likely has a less sensitive tuner, and thus cannot lock into the stations as easily."
Finally did it!,"I don’t game but atleast 1 of my TVs are running for approximately 16hrs a day. I stream all my tv content plus movies and local radio via internet. I have never gone over my 1tb cap. I average 600gigs +\- a month.  I also don’t stream 4K. If you go over Comcast gives you 2 freebies, after that it’s, I believe $10 per 50gigs. "
Finally did it!,"Awesome this is exactly what I was hoping to hear. Sorry one other question, am I able to track it on the Comcast app? "
Finally did it!,If your worried about data usage you can always get a OTA antenna for local TV viewing like football better quality as well. This is of coarse if you can get it OTA 
Finally did it!,I’ll take a look into that as well
Finally did it!,"\>  I have one TB per month. I don’t stream 4K, but do stream tv probably 3 hours a day and most of the day on the weekend with football. Also do online gaming.  &#x200B;Four user household.  The only time we run into issues is when the kids are home over the summer.  "
Finally did it!,After notice high usage I went into the Roku hidden menus and started throttling all my devices. I wasn't using 4k but for whatever reasons Netflix was pushing tons of data. Once throttled everything went back to normal usage and no picture quality loss noticed. Personally with caps I'd just set a reminder to check them at the end of ever billing cycle. If your tech savvy I set a ddwrt router to monitor bandwidth and report it to my phone it also showed what each device is using that's how I figure out it was Netflix on Roku. I think 1tb for one person is kinda hard to go over with no 4k or extreme downloading. Problem I have is 3 kids and a Wife so 3 or 4 streams going off at once even not a 4k is a good amount of data. I'd say gaming isn't super data intensive like streaming as you want to stay in sync so you really don't wanna send tons of data to the client. Just my experience
Finally did it!,150Mbps AND 220+ channels for $90??? Where are you located for that deal? Best I could find is 150Mbps and 140+ channels for $103 after taxes and fees
Finally did it!,Guy was going door to door. Had my own modem and he agreed to waive the HD fee. Trust me I know I was robbing Comcast blind hahaha
Finally did it!,"You should be fine with that data cap. I work from home and usually have a TV stream, Twitch, or a podcast running for some background noise throughout my day. I also game and night while the wife streams in bed. We have only hit 900gb once so far, usually end up in the 600-700 range. "
Finally did it!,If you like ps vue you might want to check out youtube tv. I had ps vue core for about a year. Other than missing nfl network and the discovery channel it has everything I need. The user interface is just so much better. It also never lags on me. It's $40/month.
Finally did it!,"I looked into it, but it doesn’t have food network which the wife would kill me for not having lol"
Finally did it!,"Games are data intensive, if anything is going to drive you over that will be it. Just track it for the first month or so and if need be adjust from there. "
Finally did it!,"Not compared to streaming video.  Most are just sending small amounts of data quickly.  Probably someplace in the 100-200M an hour range, tops.  HD Video can blow through 30x that an hour.  "
Finally did it!,Yeah I'd say games aren't data intensive that being said downloading 5 triple aaa games you bought on a steam sale can be pretty data intensive.
Alternatives to NHL.tv for streaming live games?,NHL.tv is basically your only option to watch every game out of market. A service with NHLN and NBCSN would get you some games. 
Alternatives to NHL.tv for streaming live games?,"If you only want to watch Blackhawks games (and no other team) you can get the single team pass for $30 off the full price.  Not a great deal, but some savings are better than none.  However, there will be 8 Blackhawks games on NBCSN (plus 3 on NBC but that's OTA), so if you want to watch those live you'd need some service that carries NBCSN or you'd have to go to a bar or something and hope they're showing it."
Alternatives to NHL.tv for streaming live games?,"I noticed that, probably will end up going that route"
Alternatives to NHL.tv for streaming live games?,NHL.tv is really the only option and it does a really good job. It uses MLB technology to send you the stream what hand down the best out their.

Cox reduced my internet bill from $80 to $70. But...,"Until 5G is widely available, I wish you luck requesting new-customer promotion pricing. In my experience, I’ve never been successful in negotiating new-customer pricing... up until like a month ago with Xfinity. I called corporate and spoke with them directly and they basically gave me the same rates as a new customer. Lesson learned: don’t talk to the loyalty depo, talk with corporate. Hopefully it won’t come to this, but if all else fails and you have an SO or roommate living with you, you can cancel the service under your name and open a new account with theirs. This is going to be a bit more involved and could result in an activation fee and a few days of no internet if a technician has to come out like Xfinity. "

Cox reduced my internet bill from $80 to $70. But...,"Are you not on contract and is there any competition in the area? If both of those are a ""yes"" then I would say you have a pretty good shot at getting them to lower the price.What I recommend is to call them telling them their price is too high and you decided to disconnect the service. Tell them you are looking to switch to their competition. Now, the key to this argument strategy is that you don't want them to immediately disconnect your service - you want them to schedule a disconnect in 2 weeks so you have enough time to get your new service installed. Bring up the promotion and say if there was anyway to get those prices you would stay, but since you can't looks like you gotta go. If those negotiations fall through, schedule the disconnect in 2 weeks. This gives you the time to decide what you really want, because you can always cancel the disconnect if you change your mind (within those 2 weeks). Keep in mind that switching services sometimes means you get additional ""connection"" fees on that first bill (and may need to buy a new modem) - so factor those costs into your decision."
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,"Here’s the dilemma...it could be one of three primary things:- Problem with YouTube TV in your area. If YTTV is consistently bad, try reporting it to their support and/or switch to another service. - Problem with this particular program on ESPN. Events like MNF draw big crowds. The stream YTTV is getting from ESPN may be overloaded. Try logging into the ESPN app with your YTTV credentials and see if it’s any better. - Problem with your network hardware. WiFi is good in many cases but not all. If you have a $300 mesh system that’s only about a year old, you should be good. But if it’s a $50 D-link or something provided by the cable company, you could be getting interference or be in the early stages of an equipment failure. Even if “Netflix and Prime work great” doesn’t necessarily mean a whole lot. Those services stream static content that’s cached on local servers within miles of your house. YTTV, Vue and other live services are streaming dozens of channels live across the country. There’s a lot more potential for failure. If you’re going all-in on streaming and know you’ll be saving significant dollars every month, invest a little up front. Make sure you either have a hard wired setup or top-notch WiFi equipment.Good luck."
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,">One Roku is set up on our Wifi and the other is set up on the Wifi extension, yet we're still having issues on both TV's.No offense, I promise, but you say that as if it's counterintuitive that it you wouldn't get good performance.WiFi itself shouldn't *necessarily* cause issues. But WiFi extenders are horrible and cause more problems then they solve. So no surprise there.Ideally, you want to be hardwired whenever possible. It's orders of magnitude better than WiFi. But that's just not possible for everyone.What model modem/router? If you're just using the combo that Comcast rents you, also not incredibly shocking.250 is far more bandwidth than you need for streaming. You just need better WiFi or placement that will allow for Ethernet. Definitely scrap the extender. They're evil and only sell because marketing. Cheers."
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,We have a Comcast rental set-up. We are upgrading to 400mbps (we have 4 kids with a million devices). We'll ditch the Comcast stuff and the extension. *fingers crossed* thanks!
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,can you temporarily hard wire either or both of the Roku's to see if the problem goes away?  Most likely wifi issues.
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,"Try Hulu with Live TV or Vue. I've had great performance on Apple TV 4K. I didn't encounter issues with YouTube TV on my end. Also, you could have used your YouTube TV account to sign into the espn app on your Roku. Sports apps are pretty stable. "
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,"I watched the game on the ESPN app, except for being kicked out once, and some commericals pausing, it was fine when the game was on. "
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,"You need a good wifi router, AC1200 or faster with external antennas like an Asus or Netgear brand. Get rid of the wifi extender if ar all possible. Set the router up with a different ssid for the 5ghz and 2.4 bands. Put the Roku devices on the 5Ghz band and your computers and phones on 2.4. "
Cord Cutting Newb Here!,"I agree that you should get rid of the equipment that you are renting from Comcast and buy your own.  Not only will it work better but it will save you money in the medium to long run.  Comcast has a list of supported cable modems at [http://mynewmodem.xfinity.com/](http://mynewmodem.xfinity.com/) I use the Arris Surfboard but I strongly suggest buying the SB8200 model because it is DOCSIS 3.1 compliant.  This means that if you wanted one day to step up to gigabit internet you likely wont have to buy a new modem.  I will note that the DOCSIS 3.0 model will likely handle your current internet speed (its what I use for 300bps on Spectrum) but it never hurts to call Comcast before buying just to be sure.  Now for the router.  All consumer wifi routers will work with the Arris Surfboard modems noted above its just a matter of deciding which one to buy.  CNET is an excellent resource [https://www.cnet.com/topics/networking/products/](https://www.cnet.com/topics/networking/products/) You can't go wrong with an Asus router that has earned ""Editor's Choice"" designation from CNET.  Don't $kimp on the router, they last for years when properly cared for and in the long run will save you money. It doesn't matter where you place the modem so long as you can connect it to a power source and the router.  The placement of the router will make a huge difference in streaming quality.  Wifi signals travel down and outward so a good rule of thumb is the higher up on a wall the better.  Also interference from TVs, wireless devices and walls are bad for the signal.  The advice in this 2016 Wired Magazine article is as true today as it was two years ago  [https://www.wired.com/2016/03/put-router-optimize-home-wi-fi/](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/put-router-optimize-home-wi-fi/)  # "

I really like all the on demand stuff too, it has a TON of on demand shows and movies for kids, which was a huge bonus.

YTTV vs Hulu Live,I did. I mostly liked Hulu Live. I just switched back to YTTV this month bc I had enough Google Rewards to cover a month for free. I plan on going back to Hulu Live next month though. 
YTTV vs Hulu Live,How long did it take you to rack up that much on rewards? 
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"If I wasn't grandfathered in to DirecTV Now's go big plan for $35, I'd be on YouTube TV.  Like you mentioned, the stability is second-to-none.  DTV Now is a lot better now than it used to be, but still buffers or drops quality on occasion, especially with live sports."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"They didn't bump your package to $40? I thought they did everyone?I have a discount go big plan too that I reactivated to give them another try, but with the quality issues, DVR failures, and (personally) my biggest grip, not being able to pause live TV and then skip ahead, I couldn't give them my long term vote. Oh, and they have zero local channels here."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"You're more patient than me, I ditched my $35 promo rate for YTTV last year because I couldn't stand how terrible DTVN was. I signed up day one and had it over 6 months, and while some things improved, too many things didn't in that time frame."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I’ve never had Hulu Live, but I really enjoy my YTTV... for what it’s worth."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I do for the most part too. My locals aren't truly local, but that's not the end of the world.I just miss the few extra channels. Seeing that Hulu had ESPN College Extra this weekend, and was carrying probably close to 10 more college games than YTTV was a little rough!"
YTTV vs Hulu Live,My biggest complaint with YTTV is no Fire stick app because of the Google and Amazon feud.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"Yeah, that's why we just started our Hulu Live trial."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,My biggest complaint is that I can't get it due to YTTV's stupid policy about local channels.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I liked Hulu w/ Live TV as a service for the vast library they had to offer. As for everything else, my experience was terrible. The UI was horrid and I kept having issues with buffering. Support told me that my internet speeds were too high (I have gigabit service) and the only option was to wait for them to push a fix. (That was December of 2017). I still use regular Hulu for their VOD, but never again will I switch to their live TV service again. Being grandfathered into YTTV at $35 is awesome. Google has a phenomenal track record of honoring grandfathered rates. Now with us being able to pause our service up to 6 months, if there's a need to switch temporarily I can now do so."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,Are you my alt? This is exactly what happened to me with Hulu Live. I even jumped on YTTV just in time to get the $35 rate. 
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I agree with Google's track record on grandfathered plans, that's what makes it hard to give up. The rep I talked to told me that if I held it more than 1 month I'd lose my pricing. No idea if they knew what they were talking about though. For what its worth, I've read that the last 3 months have made huge strides in Hulu's streaming quality. I haven't had any issues on my Apple TV.  I've never heard of ""your internet is too fast"" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I've used both services and currently don't use either (although I have Hulu commercial free). I liked the look and feel of YouTube TV much better than Hulu Live TV. One reason I switched from Hulu Live TV to YouTube TV was that I had constant buffering issues with Hulu. I've never had any issues with any other streaming service but Hulu Live TV just worked terribly (regular commercial free Hulu works completely fine..)
YTTV vs Hulu Live,How long ago did you use Hulu Live?
YTTV vs Hulu Live,The biggest yttv selling point for me was nesn. I can only get that cheaply with yttv or for 50/month with Sony. I've also never had buffering issues with yttv but ymmv.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"Same here, NESN was a must, and all my locals too sealed the deal. "
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"Last I looked, YTTV had  BBC America and Hulu did not. Still the case?"
YTTV vs Hulu Live,That's correct
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"DirectvNow if you want a great channel lineup and cheap premiums.YTTV if you want a technically superior platform with great dvr.Hulu Live if you want a piss poor stressful viewing experience, bad interface, and great on-demand."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I will be keeping on eye on this thread.I am currently on DirectvNow because of the grandfathered Go Big plan. I have been thinking about switching to Hulu since I already pay for the ad free Hulu account. That would get me to one application and I would save a couple of bucks. I do not think Hulu's DVR will bother me much because I stopped using my DVR when I had Dish because most shows that I missed were already on Hulu VOD. I wish they would do another one month free promo. I will definitely give it a go if they do. 
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"This.  It dawned on me one day I spent a lot of time on Hulu when not watching live TV, so I switched from PS Vue to Hulu Live.  I like how Hulu melds their library into live stuff.   I haven't had any issues with the DVR so far.   I only record a couple shows though. "
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I've used YTTV, HuluLive and DirecTV Now over the past year and I could go with literally any of them without issue. Like OP, I also like AMC but have access to my inlaws' login so it's a non-issue. Mostly I use these for sports so it upsets me that none of them have CBS because I miss half my football games on Sundays. But that's on CBS, not the apps. All in all, each app has features I like and mostly the same channels, but I did opt to not go back to YTTV because my wife likes HGTV.I like that YTTV shows a preview in the guide so I know if it's a commercial before I switch. I like how HuluTV provides channel groupings in the guide like Sports/News/Movies/etc. I honestly can't think of a particular feature specific to DirecTV Now to mention here.I haven't noticed any difference in live stream quality between the three."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,Don't you get local CBS? 
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"HGTV and history are my big Pros for Hulu obviously. I too have access to my parents dish account, so I can get some of the others through that."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,Does anyone find a difference in the device used?  I feel like running YouTube tv off my Apple TV works better than going direct from my Samsung smart tv. I feel like the picture is better and hardly any buffering. Maybe it’s just me?
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I have run all services of my ATV 4K and haven't noticed any difference between YTTV and Hulu
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I use Chromecast for YTTV and it works pretty flawlessly.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,Which is better for sports?  I tried HuluLive for the Super Bowl and was very disappointed.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I've been streaming NFL all day on Hulu without issues. I also haven't had issues with YTTV. Like I said, I think  they have made some dramatic improvements lately in their quality"
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"I've watched NFL, MLB, NBA, and college basketball on YTTV over the past year and have yet to have a issue with anything."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"ive been considering them, but all of 'em are missing a required channel, sooo I get to stick with cable a bit longer.   Yay. \*sigh*"
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat....need PBS; only Comcast has it live."
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I don't keep either service but have tried both out temporarily. I think if I was going to keep one Hulu would be the primary choice for me. Their channel availability and library just seem more robust based on my tastes at least. But AMC isn't a big deal to me and everyone has their own dealbreaker channels
YTTV vs Hulu Live,I had PSVue for 18 months.  Dropped them and went without for a couple months while we evaluated if we needed cable TV.  Wife got sick of the kids watching Youtube videos so instead of subscribing back to PSVue (for $50 to get added sports) we went with YouTube TV for $40.  Saved $10 and still got my sports channels and now we even have Universal Kids which used to be Sprout.  Just another kids channel for the kids to watch.
YTTV vs Hulu Live,"When I first went cord free, I used PS Vue with an antenna (got 66 channels). After a year when PS Vue went up in price, I switched to Hulu Live.   I have had no issues with being able to watch what I want to.  I also have CBS All Access.&#x200B;"

Channel surfing expeience,Directv Now has both a live guide that lets you channel surf as well as a search for shows that you can just watch like Netflix. I enjoy being able to surf and then just watch my shows directly — also the dvr function is a cool feature as well. 
Channel surfing expeience,"This. I don't understand it personally, but this was a critical feature for my wife. I'm a weirdo who only watches one or two shows, though, so I don't really channel surf.>also the dvr function is a cool feature as well. When it actually works. Haha. It's been a PITA lately. I'd still recommend DirecTV NOW, but man, their stuff has been buggy as hell lately."
Channel surfing expeience,"Yes, those who grew up flipping channels often have a hard time switching over to the new TV streaming paradigm. You especially see this in the elderly. Even I missed it some: until I kept remembering getting numb while I sat in front of cable TV holding my remote button down, and cycling through every channel in the roster repeatedly in frustration, never finding anything worth watching.That was one of the major reasons we cut the cord. And so I adapted."
Channel surfing expeience,I've never understood people who channel surf after digital on screen guides became a thing. I'll sometimes sit there and browse the guide for a while but flipping from channel to channel not only feels incredibly inefficient for finding something to watch but it's also annoying af for anyone else in the room.
Channel surfing expeience,You assumed two things here i) People channel surf to find something to watch ii) There is always someone in the room while you are channel surfing.
Channel surfing expeience,"If you're just looking for some content to flip through, Pluto TV can give you that for free.If you want something more cable like, you can do an HDHomeRun, possibly with their Premium TV add-on. "
Channel surfing expeience,"Wow! I thought most were running away from the need to channel flip. Used to be there was no way of knowing what was on. Now we get detailed descriptions before we go there, or better yet to let us know not to go there. Human behavior is fascinating."

"""Another"" Help me choose a HDTV over air antenna.","I put that yagi antenna in my attic and it is working out so well. There’s a reason it’s the best selling antenna on Amazon and everywhere else. It was explained to me that the TV frequencies are differentiated (among other things) by their wavelength, and having a longer antenna like the yagi has a better ability to pick up the most. I researched tower distances and directions, multiple antennas, amplifiers, combiners, and kept returning to the RCA Yagi.My set up is (RCA Yagi) + (Indoor antenna)  joined by a (Channel plus  2532 combiner)  > HD Homerun Quattro > Plex.

I plug that into a Tablo 4-tuner DVR, with a lifetime subscription of $175.  Tablo is very much like Plex, without the media sharing service.

"""Another"" Help me choose a HDTV over air antenna.","Man, that's nuts.  I'm over in 21046 (basically right where the 29/32 junction is) nothing inside my house would pick up any signal unless it was in front of my window, and even then it would only pick up about 15-20 channels with tons of drop outs on NBC/CBS, etc.We ended up getting a clearstream 2V with a LNA-200 Boost XT up in the attic and it's better now.  We still have a fairly weak signal to NBC and CBS 40-60% according to my TV.  We pick up about 55 channels, albeit some of them poorly, but we still get the occasional dropout, and artifacts especially when a plane flies by (we happen to be in the path directly between the broadcast tower and the landing runway.)Sadly we live on the end of a cul de sac which is on the bottom of a hill, so all the surround homes  and neighbors have higher roof-lines, and there are a number of tall trees across the street that obscure the LOS to the towers."

A lot of your towers are fairly close, but I'm guessing that you don't have direct line of sight to them, maybe you have some mountains in the way or something?My understanding of Yagi antennas is that they are very directional, so you may only have luck with the ones in the northwest quadrant, or you might need to set up two of them.That splitter looks good if you are going to be splitting the signal to 2 tvs, though you might want to hold off on buying it until after you see if you can even pick up any channels."

Help with antenna,Something between your antenna and the towers could be causing interference.
Help with antenna,"NBC is on WNJU (RF 36). It could be that you were picking up some signal from WMGM (also RF 36) from south Jersey because of a tropospheric event. That would degrade your signal quality.I've also seen people theorize that pixelation can be caused by wind swaying the 1WTC antenna: https://www.avsforum.com/forum/45-local-hdtv-info-reception/275729-new-york-ny-ota-637.html#post55980354That's just couple of possibilities. Ideally, you want to have a good strong signal so you're less vulnerable to these issues."
Help with antenna,">Can wifi affect these at all?Not the wifi signal itself (radically different frequency) but a wifi router has digital electronics in it that could in theory cause interference. Turning off all possible electronics, including LED and CFL lighting, is the test."
Help with antenna,I’m also in NYC and haven’t been able to pick up NBC with our Mohu Leaf for months now.
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I'm also considering a separate tuner device route e.g. AirTV, Tablo, etc. So perhaps I should just get the TV that fits my criteria and rely on another device for full house OTA distribution. "
Choosing a TV for OTA,"wirecutter has reviews on different types of TVs, with categories (smart, ""best"", by budget).Check them out. They're reputable if you want to look for something long term. "
Choosing a TV for OTA,"That's how I found this TV, but I've read more than one person complain that they experienced worse reception when going to this TV after another, using the same antenna."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"Sadly, there are no standards or even test results for OTA tuners. Certainly a real need."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"OTA depends more on getting the right antenna than the tuner in the TV.  They are all pretty good in that regard.   I'd pick the TV for it's features 4K, OLED, etc.  and as far as the ""smart"" goes, Roku is the best. "
Choosing a TV for OTA,"Second on the Roku.  I got the Roku Express ($29.99) and have never been happier.  I currently subscribe monthly to Hulu (the no commercials plan, which is only $4 more per month) and Netflix cheapest plan.  For 20 bucks a month I have all the TV shows I can handle.  I hardly watch OTA anymore, unless I need something live.  You should worry more about the reviews on the antenna than the tuner on the TV, as topcat5 said."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I have the 55 inch tcl (cheapest model, maybe 4 series?), and I've had no issues with antenna reception. Never really heard of the tv making any difference, I'd say your antenna is far more important. I love some of the features on it, like the built in channel guide for OTA channels, and the ability to pause and rewind live TV. The built in Roku functionality is also fantastic."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"It is anecdotal but the Insignia Roku TV 39” i got back in July has been really crashy. It crashes on me about 2-3 times a day where it will freeze up, and then restart the set. Some folks have told me their TCL have faired much better, and I have also heard that the 4k Roku TVs come with far better Roku hardware than the 1080P sets like the Insignia I got. Crashing aside, I like the Roku interface as a Smart TV because at least the ‘channels’ seem to be updated every so often and from what I can tell the vast majority of services are represented. My only concern is if I switch to a universal remote, input switching seems tedious and maybe wouldn’t work well with remotes that automate the input switching process, since hdmi inputs are like apps that you select on the screen. "
Choosing a TV for OTA,"The TCL 6 series has a known issue with some panels having some defects. But if you buy it from a store with a decent return policy and do get one of the screens with issues, you can just exchange it. "
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I have that exact same TCL you are thinking of getting, and I highly recommend you get it.  Roku TVs will ALWAYS continue to receive updates as long as Roku stays in business.  They don't leave old models behind (at least, they haven't yet).  I have 4 Roku TVs and they all update with the same features.  It's not like other TV vendors who leave their own proprietary OS's in the dust.I got my first two Roku TVs about 4 years ago; the reason we went with Roku was because my wife loved that we didn't have to switch inputs to watch streaming services vs regular TV.  When I bought them, my first two Roku TVs could 'only' tune to apps and OTA channels.  The hardware was very bare-bones and didn't do much anything except turn the tv on/off.  However, they eventually update themselves.  Examples: Roku released a feature that allowed you to 'silently' watch TV by plugging in headphones to your Remote.  This appeared to only work on newer models that came with a remote that included a headphone jack.  But they don't leave their loyal customers behind.  They add the function to their Roku App, so any smartphone with the Roku App can now use the 'silent listening' feature, even if they have old Roku devices.Another feature that suddenly popped up onto my Roku TVs: a 'guide-style' OTA channel lineup, which allows you to see what is currently on and what is coming on over the next 72 hours, without having to channel surf.  This is a new feature as of about 2 years ago.  Also, the ability to plug in a USB drive to the TVs so that you can pause live TV is a feature that was added via a software update, and it's all free; included with the TV, no add-on service required!!My setup: 1x Tablo DVR at the circuit breaker (where the OTA cable comes into the house) ($150 device + $150 lifetime DVR subscription)1x Mohu Sky 60 sitting on top of a bookshelf on the second floor (where there happens to be a CATV cable wired from the circuit breaker where the Tablo is located) ($80 on sale) 65"" Roku TV (HDR) in my home theater room (basement) ($799)40"" Roku TV (HDR) in my bedroom on the second floor ($299 on sale)55"" Roku TV (HD) above my fireplace in the Family Room (I think i paid $599 for it)32"" Roku TV (HD) in the Guest Bedroom ($199 on sale)With the Tablo setup, I can have as many devices as I want.  Yes, there is a 4-tuner limit, but we never have 4 people watching live TV at the same time.  I can easily get another Roku TV for my kids room and have OTA TV, Netflix, Hulu, and whatever apps I want set up on that TV pretty much instantly.  No additional wires needed, I just have to connect it to my home Wifi.  If you choose not to use the Tablo, you can still plug in your OTA wires to the Roku TVs.  They actually handle OTA quite well, I like the large font and on-screen channel guide; it's really slick, and I feel sorta bummed that I don't get to use it!!  But the Tablo DVR ability is well worth it!!As an added bonus, all the Roku TV remotes are exactly the same (except for the app shortcut buttons) and they work on all Roku Devices, so we have like 12 of them in our house because they are easy to fall in between the couch cushions or left somewhere out-of-place, and you can get 2 extras for like 15 bucks on Amazon.  Plus, in a pinch, you can use your smartphone as a remote for any TV.Oh, and with the Tablo, you can watch your recorded or live OTA remotely through your laptop or mobile device.  The only way you are limited with the tablo is that you must have a device that can load the Tablo App, which includes pretty much every popular streaming device (Roku, Amazon, Google, Xbox, Android, and any web browser except Microsoft Edge), but does NOT include other 'smart tvs' like LG, Samsung, Sony, Vizio, or others.  So all the nay-sayers out there are wrong.  Roku is absolutely awesome.  If you prefer functionality and convenience, then go for it.  If you are an audio/videophile then you may want to go with some other brand, although the higher-end Rokus are including Dolby Atmos and DolbyVision."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"Wow, thanks for the thorough description of your setup! What you're describing is exactly what I'm considering doing, so it's nice to hear a real-world example of it working as I hope it will. Thanks again!"
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I have 3 TCL Roku TVs and haven't had issues with OTA reception on any of them. In fact, I really appreciate how a free internet based TV guide is included, and if you add a 16GB USB drive then you get the ability to Pause/RW/FF live TV. As for ""smart tv"" concerns, 4K TCL Roku TVs are the best in that they are good picture for the money, have the performance of a Roku Ultra, and in the future you can actually disable most of the Roku functionality if you want to switch to a newer streaming device for some reason.My advice if you get a TCL Roku TV: * Get at least a 4K model, even if it's the cheapest, as that guarantees you get Roku Ultra like performance. Though I recommend going for a model with at least some HDR support if you can afford it, since that's a bigger deal in modern TVs than 4K in my opinion.* Get it from a store with a good return policy. Test every aspect of the TV when you get it, and if you notice any issues get it replaced. One of my TVs was rebooting randomly when I got it, replaced it and haven't had an issue since. Wal-Mart is actually a good option since they have a [90 day return policy for TVs they sell](https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#00000150-2911-d285-add2-fff948300000) (third-party sellers on Wal-Mart.com excluded)"
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I love the built-in Chromecast feature in certain TV brands like Sony, Vizio, and Toshiba.  Incredibly handy with so many apps, channels and weblinks out there that you can seamlessly pass off from your phone or tablet to the TV (I have a Sony).That said, I do also enjoy coupling that with my Roku devices.  I prefer the Roku over Smart TV functionality."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"Me personally I'd go with a non-Smart TV and instead go with a regular flat TV and just make it smart with a streaming stick. Since smart TV's at some point stop receiving updates and you're stuck with what you got, where is, a streaming  stick you can replace and upgrade them at any time. And not also worry about performance issues with the TV itself if it were fully smart. That's the path I've gone. Plus saves me some $$."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"At this point most TVs with good pictures are smart anyway. You accept it, get a streaming device later if needed, but also get the benefit of a decent TV guide."
Choosing a TV for OTA,"I've got 3 different sizes of the TCL Roku S405 series, they all work fantastic.  It is what I have been recommending to family and friends.  FOR THE PRICE, they cannot be beat."

"Not Receiving CBS OTA in Urban Tampa, FL","I am in Tampa and about 15 miles from those towers, and the signals are mostly coming to me over the water so lessened obstructions.I noticed that you mentioned you're using an amplified antenna.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"Then I'll cancel, simple. I'll just find something else to watch if they try to price gouge me. No contracts, and plenty of competition, that's true capitalism.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,This is my attitude for most things. Throttle my internet? Now you get $0. Non of this shit is needed to survive.
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"Ya, jack the price up, get competition.  Simple as that."
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I already did. I have tried and canceled Hulu TV, YouTube TV, DirectvNow, and Sling over some combination of not enough content and prices too high/increasing over time. There is currently no service that is worth the price it charges for the value it provides, so I’m on the sidelines waiting for someone to compete for my business. "
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,It really is as simple as this. TV and movies are not our only options for entertainment and escape.
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"That's short-sighted honestly, as there's less than 10 streaming services in America right now. Each of them have had some sort of price increase within the past year AND/OR has lost channels. All services aren't the same either; YoutubeTV doesn't have Scripps programming for example so if you're a Food Network watcher you're already getting handicapped in choices. While you have much more choice than you did before you cut the cord....that cord isn't forever in length. Unless you're fortunate to always get a new subscriber rate a la how folks get the WWE Network for almost free every year....you're going to have to eventually pay up. I'll just type this....Cox offered me a package so dang good that if it wasn't for the receiver price I'd bit. I'm a live sports watcher and need dependability (which Sling can't provide). The moment DirectvNow is above the price of that Cox package + receiver, OR the moment Cox releases apps so I can use my Apple TV to watch the programming....I'm out the cord cutting game. And we're not even talking about yet in this thread about data caps that ISPs are imposing and how a large family has to either hide behind faster plans to get larger caps (at more money than a normal plan) OR get a business line to avoid the caps...."
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,Yup yup yup. The contracts are the things we don’t want. 2-year commitment to a dish? F that.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I wish this was my case. I have been considering going back to cable.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"Yeah streaming prices are going up, but a comparable cable package is still much more expensive. Considering HBO set their OTT price to $15/m out of the gates, I think most platforms will try to get near that, or offer ad-supported tiers at a lower price."
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"For now. The owners of the content are bring it all back in, won't be long before you have to add on the Disney service to your list. &#x200B;A La Carte/PAYG has always been seen as the cheaper way (wrongly), but it doesn't factor in 'shared' costs."

Netflix+DVD, Plex and an antenna is all I need.Note to all the content companies: if you stopped being greedy and keeping your content to yourself, I would gladly pay $50/month to get all of my content in one place. Should be following the model of the music industry (most music is on almost all services) rather than each of you making your own service for your own content. Also stop putting your ads on paid services. If you're advertising your own content it's still an ad."

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"https://www.outline.com/bnwPjeTo read the whole article without the subscribe BS.The online-only television bundles that have lured away cable-TV customers with rock-bottom prices might not stay that low for long.AT&T Inc.’s DirecTV Now streaming service recently raised its basic channel plan by $5 over the summer, bringing its starting monthly cost to $40. Chief Executive Randall Stephenson this week said the company is considering additional price increases for the service.“We moved the price up and, being a very price-sensitive market, we fully expected to see a considerable number of customers drop off,” Mr. Stephenson said in an interview Wednesday. “We haven’t seen that. The consumers, it’s obvious that they’re finding value in the platform.”Streaming services like DirecTV Now, Sling TV, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV added millions of customers last year by promising big savings over traditional cable and satellite-TV subscriptions. Sling sold its channel package for $20.DirecTV Now’s basic price is “for the long haul probably still too low,” Mr. Stephenson said. He said the service has been unprofitable, and the company wants to steer the most frugal customers to its slimmer WatchTV service, which carries no sports channels and is profitable.Mr. Stephenson said WatchTV could offer a range of packages from $15 to $25 a month to appeal to more people. “We’ll exit this year with a very different looking portfolio,” he said.Market leader SlingTV this summer raised the price of its basic package by $5 to $25 a month, with its owner Dish Network Inc. blaming higher channel programming fees.“Our team works hard to negotiate fair programming deals, with the goal of keeping your price as low as possible,” Dish executive Warren Schlichting said in a blog post. “Programming fees, however, only go one direction, and that’s up!”The price increases reflect how skinny TV bundles are getting girthier as they add more channels. A Sling TV spokeswoman said the company plans to add more channels from Discovery Inc. later this year without raising prices.Alphabet Inc.’s YouTube TV service, which carries cable channels and went live last year at $35 a month, raised its monthly price to $40 earlier this year after it tacked on additional channels like TNT and TBS.The higher prices have also narrowed the value gap between new and traditional TV, since cord-cutters must still pay for broadband service. Cable-TV packages still cost more than their online imitators, though cable companies often charge higher rates for standalone broadband service as an enticement to bundle internet and video.For example, Comcast Corp.’s website currently offers new customers a bundle with 125 TV channels and broadband service for $70 a month for 12 months, rising to $90 in the second year of the 2-year contract. For a broadband-only service, with a slower internet connection, Comcast’s starting price is $40 a month, rising to $75 after 12 months.Price increases at the low end of the live TV market aren’t deterring new customers. More than 9 million subscribers will be using streaming services by the end of this year, growing to 24 million by 2022, according to estimates from investment bank UBS AG . A UBS survey found most customers had switched to the services to save money.“The fact that consumers can’t afford the [traditional cable-TV] bundle is the main issue,” said Charter Communications Inc. Chief Executive Tom Rutledge this week at a Goldman Sachs Group investor conference. Still, he said the idea that the traditional cable TV market is “falling apart” is overblown.“The traditional model is gradually declining,” he said."

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,I didn't cut the cord to save money. I did it because I fucking **HATE** advertisements. And I want to watch a show on my schedule.
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,I think what they'll find out soon enough is that people don't NEED cable/streaming. They eventually cross that fine line and people will just cancel it all together.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I wonder what Disney's streaming plan prices/features will be like whenever they get it up and running.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,None of the cord cutters I know moved over to pay services like Netflix or hulu. Cutting the cord meant more than just saving a few bucks.

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I got into directtvnow when it first started so I have the bigger package at the cheaper price, but I am one more price change from dropping the service."
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I will give you this advice that I have been handing out in here for a long time.If you have Cable Tv and you are someone that watches a lot of rerunsif you watch movies on AMC FX FXX whatever..Then get yourself a Cable Card Tuner and get a cablecard from your cable company. Normally they don't charge you for the first cable card and with that and a tuner you can record up to 6 shows at a time. Then get yourself a NAS Server and fill it with cheap 5TB drives or whatever is cheapest in your price range.. don't buy NAS drives get external USB drives because they are the cheapest and take them out of the box and put them in your NASThen you need something like a Windows 7 computer with Windows Media Center to record your shows and movies.If you pick a show like Family Guy or The Simpsons you can record all ten + years of the shows in just a couple months.. but what you should do is record any show that you consider watchable.. you will soon realize just how many shows are available in rerun or even new shows that rerun.&#x200B;I havent counted recently but I am guessing I am in the 25000 range i can't really remember.&#x200B;If you don't have cable and you have good antenna reception and get quite a few networks you can do the same thing with a TV Antenna Tuner. You can get a single tuner for $15 or you can get a 4 tuner for $100 and there are tons of movies and shows on Antenna that you are not watching because they are on at 3am in the morning or because they are on a different station and you are watching Big Brother on CBS.&#x200B;I started off with a Antenna Tuner.. then I moved to using that tuner hooked to my cable box out and recording one show at a time using a special setup that changes stations automatically and records in the background..&#x200B;Then in preparation for cutting the cord I got a 4 tuner Ceton Cable Card tuner and I got a Netgear NAS that runs android over linux and put four 5 TB drives in it that I got on black friday sales&#x200B;I also use software to take the original large file media center makes and reduces it to 720 and converts it to HVEC h.265 this makes my shows and movies tiny in size but since they started out as 1080 they are sharp enough to scale even on a 40inch tv if you are 8 feet away from it... which is fine.. thats the tradeoff i make to have lots and lots and lots of movies and tv shows.&#x200B;Then you get a tv box that can access the NAS.. I chose a cheap Android Box that is really great at hvec h.265 .. that option was my primary concern.. that box also lets me watch youtube and other free websites with free legal content as a supplement to what i have recorded and what I get over antenna.&#x200B;You are going to pay for a setup like this but you can build it over time.. start with a 5tb external drive and save all your shows and movies to that.. once you get that filled you will be ready to buy a NAS because you will have done your research for the cheapest way to build it and maybe by then 6 or 8tb drives will be as cheap as the 5tb drives who knows.&#x200B;But that is your option.. I am going to do a quick scan to see how many tv shows i have saved....&#x200B;While that is running I will say you have to optimize what you can.. and if it means getting cable again for a year or 6 months so you can record insane amounts of shows.. well you do that.. and then they are yours legally as long as you don't share them with anyone.I have about 300 into my antenna system which is 2 large antennas pointed at 2 different cities.. baltimore and Philly and i also get DC sometimes and a few channels from jersey... a lot of it is duplicates but those duplicates are good when there is weather conditions blocking one or the other city.ok so I have 32,455 tv shows recorded.. I believe I have about 2000 movies .. is this stuff great content? IDK probably not.. but I do have all of the batman, 007, clint eastwood, transformers, harry potter, startrek, star wars, jaws, and so on .. I got tons of B&W movies and Westerns and KungFu and you know.. and on top of that I have lots of TV Shows.. Some of the TV Shows I have to delete because I went overboard and started recording stuff like bewitched and I dream of Jeanie and stuff like that but I do have quite a few series that are really good ..So I am not hurting so much that I need a Netflix account or some other pay account..the only pay account I have is free shows off amazon prime video that come with my free shipping.. and I wouldn't have that except I have a situation where prime shipping is pretty much necessary for my family at this time.But there is so much stuff you can record.. you can't record encrypeted channels like HBO or even ESPN here at least.. and some systems have a lot of DRM Encryption on their stations so its not good for everyone .. but when I was recording on average 4+ shows at a time.. I would have scheduling conflicts because I had it cranked up so much it was just sucking every tv show off the system..I strongly suggest this to you if you are an enthusiast and have basic computer skills... I also suggest you get an antenna even if you arent going to record because you can normally find something that is entertaining enough to watch.but yeah.. I called this a long time ago.. and the worst part is that no one is even talking aboutIP based services like this can not be recorded to your own devices.. you have to continue using their services to use their cloud.. to access recordings that may or may not get deleted..What I record off antenna or cable .. I get to keep foreverwell thats my suggestion and thats pretty much why this sub exists.. to help people do this"

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,It’s not as simple as you think it might be. 
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,You can get a la carte series/shows now if  you go through markets like apple or google. It gets very expensive very fast though. That is why we still have bundles and will continue to do so. The networks are not going to give up revenue.
Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"I think its going that way...  technology has made it dirt cheap to produce your own TV quality content.  Its not long before someone starts aggregating at cheap cost, my like netflix and amazon are doing with original content.  I don't think they actually take much risk with those - they buy it from someone and stamp it.People have to be willing to shift away from what the big media companies are offering though.EDIT:  The alacart wont be offered by the cable providers... they need to subsidize the expensive channels"

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"Meh. I don't care about people who think they're accomplishing something by ditching cable bundles for streaming bundles. They helped poison the well. The promise of cordcutting was to push the industry to a la carte channel offerings. Instead, 'cordcutters' happily lapped up streaming bundles and birthed a new industry that was exactly like the old industry. ""Oh, but the bundles are smaller and more affordable!""  I seriously question the intelligence of someone who would use that defense. Not for long buddy. You made your bed. You're going to sleep in it."

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"They forget there is lag with this stuff.  Most people arent watching all of thier services cost everytime the bill comes in.  I would assume most cord cutters make the jump after a financial trigger service jacks up rates, too many bills, wanna save for something, etc. Which makes them evaluate all their cash outflows.  Imo the whole industry sets themselves up for cable cutting with thier teaser rate practises.  Your bill suddenly doubles and yea your gonna think about alternatives.Most people arent going to see a $5 increase and think they need to switch tomorrow, bit when they do look again, perhaps they want a particular show or channel they dont currently have, and see this other service has it and is cheaper or the same due to the $5 extra....ya they are gonna switch"

Cord-Cutters Beware: Streaming TV Prices Are Marching Higher,"OTA + Philo = $16 per month for more content then I care about.

Hulu live versus YTTV picture quality,"Its likely a setting, for me it was on the apple tv. I found changing it from 4K HDR to 4K SDR was a big change and made the picture look ""normal"" especially since the codec for that setting makes everything look dark."

Hulu live versus YTTV picture quality,"Right now I'm on Hulu live and am very happy, but am thinking about trying sling because they have a few channels that I would like to have. My problem is I tried sling about two years ago and the buffering was horrible constantly stopping to buffer. My question is has sling gotten any better, or maybe works better on different devices. As for YTTV I experienced the same problems that you described and figured I would give it another year than try again. "
Hulu live versus YTTV picture quality,"The best answer is to just try a free trial and see what happens. I did a free trial with Philo and dropped Sling due to buffering issues. Stuck with Philo and then free trialed YTTV for the football season and decided it was amazing. Between the 2 services, I have everything I need. That's the greatness of this whole streaming revolution, free trials are always available."

Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"It all depends on the terms of the contract you signed if any. The best answer I could give would be to 1) look over any documentation that you have. If there is none it’s going to be tougher.2) talk directly with someone in the cancellation department, ask what the fee is, why if you’re keeping the internet there is a fee, and when your contract is up.In most cases the cancellation fees go down as you keep the service on some type of prorated basis. however I don’t have Verizon so I have no idea how theirs works."
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"Thanks, I'm gonna head over to the store and speak to someone there. Hopefully, they'll have a better answer."
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"I had to pay when I tried to do exactly that. So what I did was cancel the entire account, then opened a new internet-only account. I have the 100/100 new customer deal for $39.99 for one year. I broke even after 4 months, and my bill went from almost $200 for the bundle to $127 total, including the internet and the streaming services I subscribe to. Use your own router and save even more."
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"Your initial contract should explain the specifics. If it's s two year contract, there's likely a fee for cancellation. I would guess that a service change that reduces your monthly payment would also be subject to a similar fee. Again, you are breaking the original agreement. That being said, have you considered asking to have the fee waived if you extend the length of the contract? You could potentially reduce your monthly fee further. Also research other options in your area. Not saying you'd even consider changing service, but the knowledge will be helpful in negotiations."
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"If you did a contract, you'd have a fee that declines every month you're into the contract. How much is the value of the fee left? You may want to ask how much ""Locals Only"" is in your area and see if it's cheaper to go to that and return all your set top boxes. Of if cheaper to pay the fee."
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,$15 per month left on the 2 contract with 6 months left. I was looking to just cancel the order and switch to YouTube the and not pay for the router rental and top box. The less money for Verizon the better!
Internet & TV Bundle with Verizon,"I don’t have any experience with Verizon, but it seems bs to me since you’re still keeping your internet service. "

I would recommend, as a minimum, a Winegard HD7694P or a Channel Master 2016/18 mounted outside and pointed generally in the direction of the ABC station. Larger versions of these antennas  would be better. No guarantees at all if you put them in the attic. "
Grounding of unused coax from pole,"Coax isn't really grounded, but rather *bonded* to your home's electrical system. The idea is to equalize the electrical potential between the coax system and the electrical system. If it's not physically connected to your home, then it shouldn't be bonded to your electrical system."

Netflix Tells Court It Isn't a Video Service Provider,">The Act, and Creve Coeur's ordinance, state that the definition of video service 'does not include... any video programming provided solely as part of and via a service that enables users to access content, information, electronic mail, or other services offered over the public Internet.' This exclusion describes the Netflix Streaming Service exactly.""I mean, to be fair, if that's really in the law it covers Netflix perfectly. To the point where I'd have to agree with them that the law was never meant to apply to online services. YouTube was a thing when the law was written in 2007, so the writers could've taken it into account.

Are they just going to pick on Hulu and Netflix or will they also go after HBOGo, Max Go, PBS Sprout, EPiX, NFL, Plex, Amazon Video, YouTube, Nickelodeon, Disney, CBS, BET, and the list goes on?

I don't think that concept was meant to cover something like the internet as a public right of way since there is no physical right of way involved. You could argue that there are the cable lines, fiber lines, etc., but that part is unrelated to what Neflix provides. If you want to tax that, then that would fall to the ISPs, not the internet services. The ISPs own the physical property that is using public land. Otherwise, you could say that all companies in the world are using public resources just because they are available via the internet.

Grounding of unused coax from pole,It is a good idea to ground a coax used for an antenna via a near-by ground rod that is also bonded to the service ground.  It helps lightening find a better path to ground if needed and cuts down on interference introduced into the cable from all your other devices sharing your electrical service.
Grounding of unused coax from pole,I do have that. The antenna is grounded to the service ground before entering the house.

Roku has a decent interface for your favorite streaming apps but it's handling of streaming from your networked library is inelegant. The raspberry pi is inexpensive and can be configured a ton of different ways.
Antenna Reception Options,"Amplifiers are for boosting the signal down the coax, they are not magical devices. If you have a bad signal you would just be amplifying a bad signal. You need a decent signal for the amplifier to send down the coax to your tuner.  Sometimes amplifiers will give your tuner too much signal and you will desensitize your tuner. "
Antenna Reception Options,"Appreciate the feedback - it seems like a lot of what I came across throws amplification as a panacea, and I've seen previous threads here that are both for and against.  I was hopeful that maybe because I get a halfway decent signal (the HDHR shows 80-90% strength, it's the ""symbol quality"" reading that seems to drop out.  Signal strength and quality on most channels are 70%+.)  "
Antenna Reception Options,"Hate to say it, but no over the air user escapes experimentation. Lots of books..some dating back a century. Radio theory is highly developed. That said, even in 2018 it continues to surprise.I would give much more credence to measurements than computer projections any day. The models are good - but the data you feed them is always incomplete.One of the things you're fighting here is that all decent antennas are generally directional. A trick used by some? Independent yagis or panels for each directional lineup with individual silicon dust tuners. To change channels, you might need to change the IP address of your viewer. (shrug) Still better than a rotator. It would be best to install the turners as close top the antenna as possible - because coax is a very lossy transmission line. Could generate problems with weatherproof your tuners.No experience with this one: http://www.winegard.com/flatwave/airhttp://www.winegard.com/help/images/e/ee/FlatWave-Air-Manual.pdf(sigh) No published pattern.

Antenna Reception Options,">I live in a ground floor apartment.There is the root problem of course. Height is usually the most important factor for OTA TV reception. Chances are your signals are a hodgepodge of reflections and refractions. The best you can hope for is is to find a magic spot and orientation for the antenna where everything comes in. You might want to do a search for the spot all over your living area if you have not yet done so.>...hooked up to an HDHomeRun Connect.Most electronic things produce some amount of interference to TV signals these days. Try to get your antenna away from such things. The list includes things like unshielded network cables, LED lights and CFL lights. Not much you can do about your neighbours stuff in an apartment.There is no reason to think that the antennas from your links would work any better than what you have. You have interesting signals coming from two directions. You could build an bidirectional antenna with some significant performance but with indoor reception there is no guarantee that more performance is actually going to help. Example:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j80C9d1o9Y* http://imageevent.com/holl_ands/multibay/4bay/superm4?p=3&n=1&m=-1&c=3&l=0&w=1&s=0&z=4 (mclapp dimensions)Since all your signals are in the UHF band the Gray-Hoverman design would also work if built without a reflector:* https://www.digitalhome.ca/ota/superantenna/index.htm"
Antenna Reception Options,"I've come across the gray-hoverman and discarded it because I \*thought\* that I had one in VHF (which I now realize is one of the PBS stations from Roanoke, which I don't need).  I could hang it from the rafter in my porch and it wouldn't be too obtrusive.  The question is would it help much.  Only one way to find out, I suppose.  "
Antenna Reception Options,"As an update, I wound up building the 4-bay antenna that u/upofadown linked to (the video guy's voice reminds me of an old college roomie, lol).

Antenna is pointed roughly south and sitting in a chair at the moment.  There's a few of the subchannels that get mild (and i mean MILD) pixellation/artifacting, but nothing I can't deal with.   Only one issue that I'm still working through is PBS (which from what I can tell is being broadcast from the same antenna to the west as NBC).  I suppose that its' 3db lower than NBC, so either i work to point the antenna that way, consider an amp, or just deal with it.  Appreciate the feedback everyone.  =)"
Antenna Reception Options,"Oh, so sometimes a DIY antenna does work indoors to improve things. Good to know...The sound of that guys voice always amuses me. He works for CBC radio. CBC radio is a kind of public radio in Canada. His slow, low and mellow thing is common on English CBC radio and he does it kicked up to 11. The video itself isn't that great but it was the only one that I could find that used the mclapp design dimensions."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"Well, if it was a mistake, just cancel it and try something else. That’s the wonderful thing about cord cutting. You can easily rotate through services and there’s plenty of competition. Unlike cable."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"The nice thing about streaming is that you aren't ever locked into a contract. You don't like Hulu Live? , just cancel and try one of the other services. Each offers free trials too. "
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"I've tried DTVNow, HuluTV and YoutubeTV.  I like the YoutubeTV app the best but like HTV the best.  Yes for local stuff you could run an antenna but where I live I get horrible reception because of mountains.  I am streaming over an LTE connection and not a hard connection.It's not a contract with a penalty so I don't think you can go wrong.  You can dump it anytime.  "
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,How many channels do you get via an antennae? Between 2 and 4? 
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"How would it be a mistake? It's not like you have a commitment, you're probably on a free trial for the first week (or month).&#x200B;&#x200B;"
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,Hulu Live works great for me.  Best part of streaming is no contracts.  Try them all if you want.
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"I actually think hululive is great. I already had Hulu,so I'm basically paying 32 more bucks for everything I watched on cable. And we all know what cable costs!!"
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,For the time being that's not a bad deal but once the throttling kicks in and fast and slow lanes are implemented (due to the repeal of net neutrality) I see a massive abandonment of this form of t.v. viewership and ppl relying more on antennas and/or traditional cable services. 
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"Hulu quality and reliability is good, but missing some niche channels that some want. Also their originals are riddled with commercials that can't be skipped, but I guess that comes with cheaper service."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"I had PSVue, but they kept upping the price.  I went with the live tv and movie package of Hulu and I pay around $48.  I like it, they've got a great library of tv shows and movies, and i get all my local channels"
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"When PS Vue first came out it was great. For $35 and you pretty much got every good channel on cable. Then comedy central and all of the Viacom channels were removed and the price went up ...What????? Rinse, Repeat."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,I wanted to try them out but morons can't be bothered to make an Android TV app. Worthless to me and a lot of other Shield TV owners.
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"Try each of the competitors (HTV, YTTV, Psvue, Sling, DTV, Philo, Fubu, etc) for a month. Then see what you like best. It's very liberating to be able to compare before deciding. "
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"You aren't locked into a contract, so you can cancel anytime you want and switch if you don't like it. Also, if you just got it you should still be on the 7 day free trial, so if you find you dislike it before that ends you can cancel at no cost."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,"PS Vue, especially if you need NFL RedZone."
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,If you don’t like it get sling. I love it!
Just went with HuluTV I hope it wasn’t a mistake,Once the throttling kicks in and fast lanes and slow lanes are implemented (due to the repeal of net neutrality) none of these streaming services will be worth it. 
Cable goes Monday,Might want to get a workable setup in place before you start cancelling things. You’ll have to check and see how far you are from transmission towers to figure out which antenna is needed. Try TVFool. Does your TV have a built in tuner? Can you mount an antenna externally? Do you need a DVR? Can the channel(s) you wish to watch be picked up with an antenna? Just a few questions you need to answer for yourself before proceeding. 
Cable goes Monday,Thanks! I know a few things sorry should of been more specific. I have only posted a couple times on Reddit. I am 47miles from the tower I want for my news broadcast. I can mount externally. I don't need a DVR. I don't know about a built in tuner. I just bought a new TV. It's a LG UHD 4k TV.
Cable goes Monday,Your now working TV Fool report is unpromising looking. You seem to be in a bit of a low spot a long way from the transmitters:* http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29&q=id%3d9038bfa101556f%26t%3dALLTV%26n%3d9If you wanted to go for it to see what you could get you would be looking at something like a Winegard HD7698P up as high as you could get pointed southeast toward the Topeka transmitters.
Cable goes Monday,Yeah I know. I may just have to go with a streaming service and cut my losses.
Cable goes Monday,You probably want to post a link to your TVFool.com report (or whatever) to get informed antenna advice.
Cable goes Monday,How much does internet cost for you?
Cable goes Monday,"This!  I dont watch much tv, but if I want the internet at a decent price, Comcast insists I get a better price.  Like without the $20 a month basic package, my internet would be $40 more."
Cable goes Monday,$67.00 a month.

Insane lag playing online games while streaming Netflix,"I’m not sure how comprehensive Smart QoS is (and I’m not familiar with your router), but I’ve solved this issue on my 20 mbps internet connection by setting up QoS. My router lets me prioritize based on MAC address, which is convenient. Not sure how wiring your Roku is going to help your gaming computer’s latency issues. Computer gaming comes down to having plenty of bandwidth and low latency. You have plenty of bandwidth, and the latency is fine when nobody is streaming (right?) - the solution is setting up QoS properly on your router or getting one that has the right options. QoS was designed to address these issues. Edit: low latency not plenty of latency. Lol. "

The only causes I can think of is that either your ISP, Modem, Router, or WiFi AP is bottlenecking you for some reason. Looking at your router's specs, it doesn't seem like it's the cause.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"This is not a solution, but it is useful and related. I try to buy Blue-ray copies with a digital code and redeem in a manner that ends up on Movies Anywhere. A) Clever idea for a streaming service. B) Movies purchased or redeemed on one streaming service connected to your Movies Anywhere account usually sync back to all other connected services. I assume this introduces some redundancy in case one of those services starts purging past purchases.For example:1.	Purchase disc copy.2.	Redeem included code on Vudu.3.	Vudu registration syncs to Movies Anywhere account.4.	Movie shows up in iTunes library."
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,I did this for a while but the problem is that not all blu rays use the same way of collecting the movies. Had to make special accounts sometimes and have movies spread out across google and other places.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Apple, *or any digital media retailer*. Amazon has deleted ebooks from Kindles. Every digital media purchase is subject to the same potentiality of loss if not stored locally. There are games I have on my Xbox 360s hard drive that I wouldn't be able to get back if it were deleted because the publishers licensing rights on those titles expired and they're not longer on the Microsoft marketplace. It's a safe bet that if you intend to own something forever, store it locally and ideally physically.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"> Apple, or any digital media retailer.This is not true.  It is only true if the digital media retailer does not let you store a local copy.  For instance, I have Audible (which is owned by Amazon) and over the 17 years I've had it several of the books I bought are not for sale any more on their store, but I still have my local copies, and I can still download them from my library.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Always download your digital movie/TV purchases.
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"I don’t understand why this isn’t more prevalent.As I understand the story, Apple didn’t take the purchase away.  The DRM keys weren’t revoked or anything.The better analogy would be that he ordered the movie from Apple some time ago, and never bothered to pick it up.  Now it’s no longer stocked at the store, and they don’t have an extra to give you.There might be a claim if the movie was never downloaded/streamed (I never got it), but if it was... what you paid for was provided — and would still work if you took care of it.The bigger complaint in my opinion would be not getting a notification that one of your movies is “going out of stock.”  The burden shouldn’t be to host it indefinitely — I don’t see that in the promise of a movie download.  Instead, it should be notification of some sort:  “Hey! We’re losing the rights to resell this film.  If you want to keep your copy, make sure it’s downloaded by X date.”"

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Always surprises me that people think any company that sells media in the same fashion couldn't do the same thing.  Apple gets all the attention because they are the richest. Gotta drive those page views.
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"I don't know why people think they're safe if they buy the media physically.Physical media will, in the long run, fail. So unless you back it up and keep those files backed up then you're likely to lose those as well.Personally, i tend to watch something only once and then never look at it again so I don't even care about buying it physically or digitally."
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"There's a significant difference between losing something to physics and entropy, and losing something simply because of the vagaries of licensing.Plus, as you pointed out yourself, it's a hell of a lot easier to back up physical copies."

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Yep. https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"This is exactly why I always buy the physical copy that includes a digital code rather than JUST the digital version.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Ive already grown to accept this reality. I’m being smart about it thought. My digital library is backed up through a majority of major digital retailers. Because of moviesanywhere and ultraviolet, I’ve got a large library for vudu, FandangoNow, itunes microwaves FandangoNow,itunes, Microsoft movies, amazon and paramount movies. So, if one digital retailers goes down, I’ve got plenty of backups which I encourage backups in case things like this happen. It’s a pain in the ass but it’s worth it. "
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"The only ""digital"" content I purchase is using either my no-rush digital dollars via Amazon or the surveys I take via Google Opinions.  Otherwise, I do buy the physical media or borrow it via the library; usually I go to the library."

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"I know Microsoft has been very good in this regard.

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"I kind of assumed Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon all do this. This is why you don't buy digital if you expect to own a copy. "
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Yep very unfortunate. I have lost things from Sony and Microsoft as well And even YouTube. But on YouTube Idk if the creator deleted the content or if YouTube did (the creator blamed YouTube of course) but that's why I'm a hard copy kind of guy. Because even if you ""purchase"" a digital copy of something you could still lose access to it eventually. Whether it's because the site shut down (like ultraviolet even tho those transferred to Fandago I believe) or because the rights are lost. So as others pointed out for movies that I know I will want to keep (plus Blu rays have better sound than streaming) and the same goes for games..if I know I want to keep them I buy the hard copies. Sucks that they push the ""legal"" way to get content digitally but yet there's no guarantee that it will always be yours.  "

Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Not cool. 
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Used DVD's and Blu-rays are like $1-3 at garage sales and thrift stores. The $150 you spend a year on a streaming service could buy you a more permanent entertainment library. 
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Remember, DVDs are 480i quality. Like why are they releasing films and TV shot in 1080 or higher on a DVD? It's extremely infuriating when there's only a DVD copy and not a Blu-ray. Blu-ray should be the standard. I feel like DVD is a ripoff and the studios know it. I would pay extra for Blu-ray, it's only like $5 more and you get so much more."
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Absolutely. I've reached the point where I own every movie (DVDs), I want. $1 at pawn shops, craigslist, etc. The idea of paying $3 to $4 to rent online or $9 and up to purchase online is ridiculous. "
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"Call me old school, but this is why I still download every purchase I make through the iTunes store to an old Mac desktop computer. So it doesn’t matter to me if they remove it from the cloud, I still have the file on my computer."
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,They should have to issue a refund then. If not this is theft.
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"ITT: people who have no idea how copyrights work, but love shitting on Apple. "
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,"The problem is presenting it as “buying” the media. You want to tell me up front you might have to take it away, then that could be understandable. "
Apple Can Delete You Digital Movie Purchases Anytime,Maybe it's because it's taking away things we bought and paid for fair and square with no recourse or refund. If this is the result of copyright law then the law needs to be changed. This is going to be a growing problem going forward.

"U.S. SVOD BritBox Secures 400,000 Subscribers Eyes 500k Target",I like BritBox (I love Acorn) and it is great to see them getting subscribers. I like that they said they don’t want to compete with Netflix but see themselves as “gravy”. I completely agree with this. Acorn is cheap ($5 per month or $50 a year) so I always have that. BritBox is a little different and IMO priced a little too high for what they offer but they are great to have for a couple months at a time and binge some great British entertainment. 
"U.S. SVOD BritBox Secures 400,000 Subscribers Eyes 500k Target",It's $7 a month. Acorn TV is available through some public libraries for free like Hoopla Digital (which has had some British shows) but unfortunately I don't think Britbox has a similar library program.
X-Post r/FuboTV: Motorsports.tv formally known as MotorsTV is reportedly shutdown at the end of the month.,It’s also on Sling as well. Huge shame. I was worried when Motorsport Network bought them two years ago that this day might be coming. Sad that they’ve decided to shutter the channel so many loved. To make matters worse their on demand service is pitiful and almost completely useless. They’re even gutting that too though by ceasing to produce the live races. Watching motorsport on demand is a pain. It’s something that imho needs a linear channel at all times.

Spectrum NY-1,Probably because they know it's a channel exclusive to them and maybe one of the last bastions preventing people from cutting the cord.
Recommendations please,"I'm a sports nut, so I have different basic needs than you do... but I'm wondering if Philo might not fit your requirements. It's inexpensive and has DVR and (I think) the networks that you mentioned."
Recommendations please,"Thanks, I'll check it out!"
Recommendations please,"Check out PlayStation Vue, it has the channels you want and the best DVR. "
Recommendations please,"Thanks, I'll check it out! Does it have forced ads on DVRd content?"
Recommendations please,"Sadly, 3 of the 4 local networks in my market don't allow saving DVR content on PS Vue. That's pretty much a dealbreaker."
Recommendations please,"I have Hulu no commercials with live tv currently. I was with YTTV and loved it until they forced the VOD on us. My Hulu package is less than $10 more than I was paying with YTTV. I have been watching all summer. The sitcoms I caught up on were all on demand and commercial free. I have watched a couple of summer shows all commercial free. I am now dvr’ing the Ellen Show because that is not on demand and I can FF through the commercials. I keep seeing posts that indicate you have to buy the enhanced dvr to FF through shows, I just haven’t experienced that yet. Once this tv season starts it might be different. I have an LG smart tv with the Hulu app which is fine most of the time, but if I am playing back a DVR’d recording, I have to use my phone, tablet or Roku stick, otherwise the picture quality is crap. "
Recommendations please,"Thanks for the info, I really appreciate it! I have a dumb (but really nice) TV, so would be using it either through the Roku or Chromecasting from my phone, so that shouldn't be an issue."
Alternatives to set-top boxes in other rooms with Verizon,"I’d just put it in a spreadsheet. Keeping current setup = $$$$$. Cordcutting = $$. Assuming all of the TVs actually have digital tuners, they could get broadcast networks via antenna rather cheaply and easily. Getting streaming channels is going to require an upfront investment in a bunch of Roku boxes, but they’ll break even in just a few months. Make sure their internet is uncapped or this could get expensive quickly. Could something portable like an ipad replace several of the TVs?Ultimately they have to show a willingness to adapt to the changes. Otherwise you’re just banging your head into the wall. "
Alternatives to set-top boxes in other rooms with Verizon,"If they are that unwilling to change, I don't see much you can do for them.  If they don't want to try something new (or even try a lower internet speed for a month) I wouldn't stress myself over their bills"
Alternatives to set-top boxes in other rooms with Verizon,"I've tried that, and things just get to be a nightmare. We're at the lovely in-between point where they are still able to handle things on their own, but are overwhelmed by it and ignore things instead. It's easier to start trying to get them to transition now, as time goes by, it gets harder and harder. It seems to me that cable's going to be pretty much a thing of the past in ten years. Better to try to start transitioning them now, I'm just looking for a way that maybe isn't so abrupt.Believe me, I don't want to stress myself over their bills, etc. Unfortunately, I know it's easier to prevent an issue than it is to fix it."
Alternatives to set-top boxes in other rooms with Verizon,"I mean, if you went with a service like YouTube TV or PlayStation Vue, then got a bunch of cheap Rokus for all the TVs, that'd be pretty much what you want. You can have a bunch of devices setup with the same account, as long as only a few of them want to watch simultaneously. Both services have large Cloud DVRs and on-demand libraries.Only other options I can think of involves obtaining a CableCard from your provider, then either getting a TiVo Bolt Vox with multiple tuners plus its extra TiVo Mini Vox client boxes for the other TVs to allow for watching anywhere in the house(this isn't a cheap setup). Or for more advanced setup you can get an HDHomeRun Prime and a bunch of Android/Android TV/Fire TV/Apple TV devices to stream in other rooms, or optionally setup a Plex Server and use that as a DVR and middleman to other devices(like Rokus)."
Alternatives to set-top boxes in other rooms with Verizon,"First thing I would do is figure out what channels they do watch and downgrade that plan, that's going to be the quickest way to same some money. See if their cable account lets you login to apps, the Disney app on the TV in a kids play room, ESPN app in the garage, might be all they need instead of a full cable box.  Basically go hybrid, keep cable but stream some.  "

Is it possible to remove a channel from being selected on the Playstation VUE Guide - Amazon Firestick interface,I’ve wondered this as well.  I have favorites selected but the other channels still appear in the guide.  I don’t seem to be able to configure the guide.  Help!

I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"The game was only available on NFL network unless you were ""local"" to cincinnati or baltimore then you could watch it on NBC.  Maybe your zip code wasnt considered ""local"" enough and you were blacked out for this one?  Im not exactly sure its just the only thing that i can come up with.  If i would have seen this earlier I would have asked if you had an antenna and to check and see if the antenna gave you a different result.  "
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"the Hulu tech told me I should have been able to stream it.  I'm like 35mins out of Baltimore...that's gotta be within the ""local"" range.  Do you know if there is a way to check the ""local"" zip codes or something along those lines?"
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,Hulu Live is notorious for terrible quality and constant buffering. Also remember it is still in beta.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,Beta for 18 months. Only in electronics do companies get to charge full price for the “beta” experience.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"I don't know. I've never paid for Hulu. Was it blacked out locally (less than 30 minutes away)? If not, you probably would have been able to watch it for free with a digital [antenna](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/antenna). "
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"It was not blacked out locally.  Per the Hulu chat tech I was talking to, I should have been able to stream the game.  And yes, a digital antenna would have worked fine...but I'm trying to keep this simple.  I chose Hulu Live as my wife likes HGTV and FOOD network.  I can try Youtube TV also...but Hulu would be preferable."
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"NBC and CBS lost TNF games this year. Last night's game was only on NFL Network. Check the schedule on the NFL website.  There are a few games that only NFL Network has streaming rights to and you would need Vue, Sling TV, DirecTV Now, or Fubo TV as they have plans with that channel."
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"NFL broadcast contracts have a clause that says in the case of a cable-only game (NFL Network or ESPN) the primary media market of both teams is required to also air the game on a local station. Which local station gets the rights to the local rebroadcast varies in each city. So it appears NBC in Baltimore had the rights to last night's game. As for why it wouldn't be available on Hulu for someone in Baltimore, I have no clue."
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,That can't be accurate.  My cousin streamed the entire game via Hulu Live and the live NBC channel.  He lives nearby and sent me a photo of it.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"NFL network game is reason whyListen you want live sports.  PS Vue is the best bet.  Core + redzone has everything you want for sports. espn 1espn 2espn ufox sports1fox sport 2cbs sportsnbc sports Mlb networkNFL networkThen you have regional sports.  NYer here, so YES and SNYyou wont be disappointed.PS vue is $64 month and 'net is $59    Saving like $750 a year"
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"So it looks like this might be a one off situation. An antenna is a great thing to have especially if you watch sports. I've never used hulu live, but I have used yttv and ps vue. yttv is better or as good in every way except it has less channels than ps vue. yttv is $40/month, ps vue core is $50/month. yttv has all of the appropriate sports channels in my area except nfl network and redzone. For non sports channels that I like yttv is also missing discovery channels and the travel channel. dvr is 9 months for yttv vs 28 days for vue."
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,We tried Sling then Hulu Live but ditched both for YouTube TV. That was ~6 months ago. Haven’t regretted it once. 
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,Yeah I'll probably try Youtube TV if I can't get Hulu Live working consistently.  Hulu is preferable as it will compliment our Netflix and Amazon Prime accounts.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,"I really, really wanted to like Hulu. The buffering was just ridiculous and we bounced back to Sling after 3 months.I watched the game last night on NFL Network without a hitch."
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,When was this? Earlier in the summer I know Hulu released an update to address some issues. I did a trial soon after and never had any issues with the buffering that I had read about.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,Try Playstation Vue. Hulu is horrendous.
I want to cut the cord but first experience with Hulu Live didn't go well...convince me to stick with it,YTTV! Nuff said.
"Best streaming service to watch soccer in 4K (EPL, CL)","If you want 4K, then fuboTV is the only streaming OTT cable option with any 4K HDR support currently. Not sure if that includes EPL coverage though."
"Best streaming service to watch soccer in 4K (EPL, CL)",fubo appears to just have one college football game (that is shown on FS1) every week in 4K.  Fox Sports seems to be the only one with any sports in 4K in the US.  I haven't heard of any of the other sports content providers having 4K feeds publicly available yet.
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Not trying to give a pithy response, but isn't this just cable delivered via the internet?"
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Pretty much.  Though you can usually get more features for a better price thanks to competition.  
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Basically, but it gives the ability to drop and add services with impunity which is powerful."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Some of us like ""cable"", we just don't care for the forced bundling, price creep, forced rental of equipment and add-on fees.My $35 YouTubeTV subscription is less than the assorted fees I would pay for equipment rental of 3 cable boxes, an HD fee, local broadcast fees and the DVR fee. And that's before I select a content package."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,It depends on how you define cable. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Indeed it is. That's why I just use an antennae for over the air channels. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,The difference is no contracts and on demand viewing. It’s not subtle when it comes to the customer experience.
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"It is and that is where we are headed. You think the whole: I'll sign for X these months and then cancel, and then I'll sign for Y these other months; will exist without them fighting us tooth and nail?"
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Nothing to say here other than why are you bombing Diegos?  Or was it just the one Diego and now you're done?  I'm asking for a friend. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"This question is asked with some regularity on here. Not trying to be pithy either, but: Does anyone really care about the semantics of what is or isn't ""real"" cord-cutting?"
The case for combining live TV streaming services,That's exactly what it is. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,We do this with Vue Core and Philo. Gives us a near complete bundle of channels we want. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Honest question, do you ever get confused on what channels belong to what service? I've thought about doing something similar but it seems like I'd have problems keeping track of which app I need to go to to see the channel I want. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Doesn't this add up to more than cable?
The case for combining live TV streaming services,If only I could get good internet from a provider that's not the cable company
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Currently using YoutubeTV + Philo. Works out to $40+16, so $56 for every channel I need. Comparing to how much that would cost with Spectrum in my area, for their ""Silver"" Package the pricing works out to this: $65 for base service + $20 for DVR fee + $14 for 2 TV Boxes + $9 broadcast fee = $108/month before taxes and other fees (like regional sports fee). YTTV and Philo both work on devices I already own and have free DVRs associated with them. Traditional cable providers lure people in with these barebones rates that when you add the devices you need and the fees associated with them the pricing becomes almost double. No wonder people are cutting the cord in the traditional sense like crazy."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Outside of sports, what live TV is even necessary? "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,PBS
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"well, some 24/7 news maybe.  Hurricane coverage, live election coverage for instance. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,for real though
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Several people on the sub have the Vue+Philo or YTTV+Philo combination and seem to really like it. For me, personally, it's too much stuff I'll never watch.At some point, I feel like people start falling into the trap of wanting as much content as possible, even if they don't really watch it or they could refocus their attention without it."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Good point. It’s a mental thing. Most people are accustomed to the cable way of life that when they cut the cord, they attempt to replicate that experience albeit at a lower cost. I’m guilty of it.If it were solely up to me, I’d probably drop live tv completely (or to a very basic skinny bundle) and just use Hulu, Netflix and Prime Video with occasional subs to HBO, Showtime, Starz."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Yeah, it's kinda turning into ""cable without cable.""I'd be more inclined to join one of those services if it had true a la carte channels."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Hulu and Philo for me. So long as Hulu stays at $40 it's cheaper than cable for me, especially since that factors in the standard Hulu service too."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Antenna, Netflix, and Prime. The only extra cost when we dropped Dish was Netflix because we've always had Prime for  shipping. Went from $85 a month to $12 or whatever NF is now. We already had standalone internet from Spectrum, so no change there. We do have hardware costs, though. We bought a DVR for the antenna channels that was about $300, but had no monthly fee. And an antenna that cost about $100 after all was said and done. Let than 8 months payback with our savings. That was three years ago. I'm playing around with a HD homerun now but not sure how we will use it. Also have another DVR that is less capable than our old one for the bedroom. This kind of setup works if you don't move frequently, and can put up an antenna. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"HD Homerun owners here, too!The perfect set-up for us is using Sling for the national sports networks (ESPN, Fox Sports, etc...) and the HDHR for the locals. I can appreciate the ease of having a streaming service that includes the locals, but in our case we can get them for free OTA so we see no need to pay extra for them. Sling is great bc it offers exactly what we need without having to pay extra for the stuff we can grab over the air.I like the way sling is headed with the AirTV box and the AirTV Player. It's designed for people like us, but it more seamlessly incorporates all your Live and DVR'd OTA content into the same guide with your streaming channels which makes it function like a traditional set top."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Still waiting on someone to implement a decent DVR for all channels -- something that allows me to ffwd through commercials. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"I think it depends on why you're cutting the cord. I cut the cord primarily because of cost. Yeah the lack of competition sucks but at the end of the day, if Comcast or Verizon offered decent prices I would still be paying them. So this idea of combining multiple streaming services at upwards of $100 per month is a non-starter for me. There was an article on TheVerge recently about how these non-cable options have basically re-invented cable. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Understood but you should read the article. The writer specifically states that the average cable cost is ~$100 and by combining certain services, your total cost doesn’t come near that amount. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,fubo and youtube tv are my combo. they cover the bases I need. and both are at grandfathered prices. forgot to mention also an espn+ subscriber. paid the flat yearly fee to save money.
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Hulu Live (With HBO) + CBS + Netflix.  I think we pay around $53. Combined.   
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"I realize that there are more people cord cutting these days that might actually still want to live television, but I honestly do not understand the appeal of live television with commercials I cut the cord to get away from that bullshit"
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"No one talks about clikia. Has AMC, MSNBC, Turner, Viacom, all the broadcast networks including PBS, $40/m. And yet they don't seem to get any press, never mentioned in the same breath as Sling or Hulu."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,>clikiaI've never heard of them either - odd mix of channels and I feel there is almost no extra info about the service or FAQs available.&#x200B;
The case for combining live TV streaming services,I've never heard of it. I imagine most people haven't. 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,They don't seem to have DVR functionality which is included in the more frequently mentioned services. That's a must have for me.
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Sounds kind of sketchy. Announced a year ago with no actual deals in place: [https://www.multichannel.com/blog/clikia-says-it-will-join-virtual-mvpd-race-414592](https://www.multichannel.com/blog/clikia-says-it-will-join-virtual-mvpd-race-414592)&#x200B;The company itself is an over-the-counter stock.

The case for combining live TV streaming services,If you’re paying 40 a month and not getting ESPN access you’re getting fucked 
The case for combining live TV streaming services,Mad hat media
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"There are about 25-30 channels that I want, heavy on sports broadcasting. To get those on cable I generally need to move beyond the basic level and into at least the second tier and often the third. I get literally hundreds of channels I will never watch and we need to add in extra box(es), HD, misc charges, etc. My costs with cable push well north of $100-$130 which compares very unfavorably with Vue at $50 or YTTV $40. I can add Netflix, Curiosity, and ESPN+  to the mix  and still pay about half as much, get better viewing options, better quality and a better user experience. For what I want there really isn't any contest. "
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"I get all the channels I want on PSVue and supplement it with Netflix. Saved me about $35 a month from what I was paying Cox, which did not include DVR."
The case for combining live TV streaming services,"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuughhhhhh.Why would you do that when you can have Netflix for a couple months, cancel and do Hulu for a couple months (usually the fall), cancel and do HBO for Game of Thrones..........This is crazy talk to me. Also, HOW ARE PEOPLE STILL PAYING FOR COMMERCIALS?????????"

DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"You could try it for a month and see if it works for you.  If not, just cancel it, and go back to DTVN."
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,You used to be able to buy some episodes of Velocity shows on YouTube. Don't know if they still do that.
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"The only real downsides that I can see for the HDHomeRun Premier service are:1)  you can't watch it outside of your local home network unless you have a media server set up that is capable of streaming OTA TV (like Plex or Emby)2) if you do have Plex or Emby, you could watch it remotely, but the rate will be limited by your current home internet's upload rate3) you are limited to the same number of simultaneous streams as you have tuners in the HDHomerunIf those aren't major concerns for you, then the HDHomerun premier service may well be what you are looking for.  One BIG plus is that, with a guide subscription for $25/year to Schedules Direct, or a roll your own guide using Zap2It, if you use something like Kodi or Emby, the guide integrates seamlessly with OTA and Live, and if you have a DVR set up on your network, you can record just like any set top DVR.&#x200B;"
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"DirecTV Now is an unreliable service. I'd consider switching to another live tv streaming provider regardless. If the one you pick lacks a channel you like, try pairing it with Philo. "
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"> PhiloPhilo is good but they don't have Fox News (my Dad watches it), and it doesn't work with Plex unlike HDHR, but if I still paired Philo + HDHR TV it would $51/mo, so we would save $4/mo."
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"Downloaded the Direct TV Now app on my Firestick, but haven't subscribed yet.Opened the app up today......there's a Reviews section; hysterical.....all the reviews are negative!Biggest complaint was in April 2018, because of an update that cut off subscribers with the First Gen Firestick, with no warning!Other reviewers talked about bad CS, spotty streaming, and availability issues."
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,I travel in an RV full time and I ve had nothing but flawless Direct Now service via cell signal in remote locations to big cities. 
DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,"I have the HDHR premium service now and am not renewing. The quality is just terrible. They have to allow up to 4 streams at the same time (all other digital providers have cloud DVRs so they really only provide one stream). The streams are 1-4Mbps. For context DTVN and PSVue are 5-15.The steams also don't work with Plex yet. They appear but are really choppy. You can force transcoding and they are playable, but the quality is then additionally bad.It's a good service in theory. Love not paying for my locals and integrating cable, but it's not there yet.

DirecTV NOW to HDHR Premium TV?,I actually think the low HQ streams would actually be useful. We have a data cap and I feel like my Dad would be fine with 1Mbps-4Mbps as he sits like 7 ft. from the TV. But I wish they had options for lower/higher quality streaming. Maybe even HEVC?

"Trying to cut the cord in Toronto, Canada","Except for the sports leagues, Crave TV and Dazn and a limited version of CBS All Access, I am not familiar with any live streaming services in Canada. (Edit: Actually All Accces is not Live in Canada because no local affiliates there).Many libraries in Canada have subscribed to Hoopla Digital, Kanopy, or Indieflix so also check your library's website before signing up to see if you have those options. In the US some libraries also have Acorn TV, which I know is available there for you to subscribe to but may be at libraries. These would mostly likely be free as the library does the subscription. You need a library card.According [Justwatch.com](https://www.justwatch.com/ca), the streaming services in Canada are (most should be subscription): Crave TV, Netflix, Prime Video, The Movie Network Go, iciTouTV, TubiTV (free), Hollywood Suite, Fandor, Acorn Tv, Sundance Now, Shudder (not sure if still available but listed), Mubi, GuideDoc, and Britbox. For purchases and rentals, look at:  Itunes, Google Play, Cineplex, Playstation, Microsoft Store, and Youtube (or YouTube Premium?). Note that in some places in Canada, especially if you live close to the US, you can use an antenna to get channels.  Go to TVfool.com to see if any antenna will work for you. If you need help picking an antenna, you can post your tvfool.com report and we can make recommendations."
"Trying to cut the cord in Toronto, Canada","I'm not aware of any live tv streaming services that currently work in Canada.  However, Silicon Dust's Premium TV is supposed to be coming out for Canada eventually.  So keep an eye out for that."

"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",Personally I don't think there's anything wrong with a Roku box (I have 2). But when I tried out the Shield it became my preferred box and was put on our most used TV. I plan on replacing the two Roku boxes with Shields. The only thing I wish the Shield had that Roku has is remote finder. The darn remote is so easy to lose. 
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",If you're just into viewing/streaming Roku is the king of the hill.
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",I’ve owned streaming devices from all mentioned and the most dependable one is the Apple TV hands down even better than the Nvidia Shield. While i do like Roku TV’s there CS is terrible and I wont ever by an other product from them because of it. 
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon","I had the nVidia Shield and the Roku Ultra. I like both. The Shield is fancier and seems to have a new plex client, but in the end paying double over the Roku Ultra was simply not worth it to me. I don't game.Oh, and I hate the nVidia remote :)"
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon","I prefer Android TV/Nvidia Shield to a Roku. Can stream, play games, and play video directly. The last bit important to me that Roku can't do afaik"
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",I've enjoyed ROKU from the days when they were audio-only. They had Pandora and streaming from your mp3 share on your own server. Some Linux required!It was awesome. 
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",where's spotify for roku though? That's the only gripe I have.
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",Been a cord cutter for more than 10 years have used every device beside apple and a roku has been connected to my tvs through all of them i have a shield as well and yes its more powerful but nothing has the breadth  of compatabilty with services that roku does.
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon","I like the quotes in the article, and he's right. If Google, Apple, or even Amazon decided to make TV a number one priority, Roku might have a real fight on their hands.In the meantime, they're a company dedicated to TV competing against companies who happen to dabble in it."
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon","Roku's hardware and software platform is terrible, but it's inexpensive and it gets the job done.  Apple, Amazon or Google could absolutely eat their lunch, but Apple won't make cheap hardware and Amazon and Google are always in a pissing match."
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon","Unless Apple releases a cheap $50 streaming stick, Roku has nothing to worry about, but Apple is never going to go cheap. "
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",Apple is now selling a $1500 cell phone... so yeah they do not go cheap.
"Why Roku isn’t afraid of competition from Apple, Google and Amazon",Especially Google--they have too many oars in the water.
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,"Alright YouTube TV, where you at!?"
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,Who would have thought getting more eyeballs on your shows would help your stock?
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,"Pretty sure they're referring to on-demand streaming of Discovery content, not their live channels, which are part of lots of streaming services (DTV Now, Watch TV, Philo, PS Vue, etc.). So past seasons of their shows will now go exclusively to Hulu rather than to Netflix or Prime Video."
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,Hmm they announced a deal with Sling TV today as well. 
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,Discovery network last CEO didn’t really mention it all in the CNBC interview. Only when prompted. He really wanted to punch Hulu I guess because it has more recognition and would benefit the shares more. 
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,"I did some spot checking.  It's not good.  For instance Alaskan Bush People has 8 seasons and 75 episodes, but Hulu only has 14 from seasons 1 & 2.  Not even complete seasons.I would expect all previous seasons with an announcement like this.So this is garbage."
Discovery stock sees best day in 8 years after announcing it will exclusively stream shows on Hulu,Hopefully it’s in the works. Tanked for example has 14 seasons with 143 episodes. They have S6 through S8 and it’s been that way for a while now with nothing new added and I keep getting warnings they will fall off. Maybe any existing contracts need to expire or maybe the new deal starts October 1?
"Are the different numbers after the dash, after the channel, the same tower?",Yes.  They are subchannels broadcasted on the same frequency from the same source.
"Are the different numbers after the dash, after the channel, the same tower?","Not always, my local FOX station has two transmitters in different locations on different frequencies with the same HD feed for coverage; the firsts shows up at 26-1 and the other as 26-6.  It’s not common but the standard does support it. "
"Are the different numbers after the dash, after the channel, the same tower?",Thank you.
"Are the different numbers after the dash, after the channel, the same tower?","Actually, technically no. The number after the dash does represent sub-channels, but it doesn't guarantee the channel is from the same tower, as it can be set by the broadcaster to whatever number is needed.For example, one of the towers near me broadcasts two channels, each with their own sub-channels. If you didn't look it up online it'd be impossible to tell they are being broadcast from the same tower since they both have a -1 channel and a -2 channel.In another example, a channel near me was moving towers, so they started broadcasting from the new tower, but did so using a sub-channel. So I had the same channel twice, from two separate towers, but one was -1 and the other was -2."
"Are the different numbers after the dash, after the channel, the same tower?",Generally yes (though I'm certain someone has come up with an exception by now).
"Need device recommendations, please","My opinion you get the Ultra because ""you never know"" sort of things, like ""Hey, I'd like to attach a USB drive of media."" or ""Sure wish I could hard wire this thing"".  Stuff like that.  It's up to you really.Personally, I think it's worth it.... if you can find one, a Roku 3 would likely also work for you (I use Roku 3's)."
"Need device recommendations, please",Thank you very much. That’s kind of what I was figuring but thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask.  Sometimes it helps to hear it from someone else.
"Need device recommendations, please","The Stick+ is the best deal if you don't need USB. Even if you don't need 4k, the plus as has better wifi for minimal extra cost."
"Need device recommendations, please",Thank you!  Better WiFi is definitely something that I’m looking for. 
"Need device recommendations, please",Apple TV 4K
"Need device recommendations, please","While it’s undoubtedly a good device, I don’t have Apple TV 4K money. "
"Need device recommendations, please",Boxes for main TVs and sticks for occasional use. The boxes always get a better signal and most have extra ports.
"Need device recommendations, please",I’ll probably just leave the bedroom TVs hooked up to the antennas because neither of us really watch TV in our rooms but that’s a good option for the future. 
"Need device recommendations, please","In my experience, the Fire devices always work better/faster than Roku ones.  I used the Xfinity App (IDK if it's the same as the comcast one you're talking about) on Roku and it SUCKED!!  it took forever to load and it would crash all the time.  However, I haven't used it on a Fire stick.  I just cancelled the Xfinity streaming service.  I am not a Roku Hater.  In fact, I have 6 Roku Devices and only 1 Fire device.  But I will admit that there are some things roku does not do well, and one of them is the Xfinity streaming app.  My recommendation: get yourself a Mohu Sky 60.  I got one and I don't even need to mount it.  I just put it on top of a tall bookshelf and I get full signal all the time.  I live in zip code 21113 and I get all channels in both metro areas around me, I am not anywhere near a TV station/tower.  If you want a DVR, I went with Tablo TV.  It works with any streaming device and adds on-demand functionality to your OTA antenna."
"Need device recommendations, please","Unfortunately, the Xfinity app only works on Roku.  I just signed up for a free trial of Hulu live and it works just great on the Firestick which means I'm not in a hurry to buy a Roku, which is nice.Looking at the channels that I get on the Xfinity app it looks like the only thing I really care about is HBO and I use HBO Go for that, so I'm not too concerned now about using the app on the Roku.I'm glad to hear your experience because I would have been more pissed than I already am about their stupid service.  I'm getting it free for another year (minus the broadcast TV fee) so I'll probably end up canceling it after that's over.With Hulu live there's really no need to upgrade my antenna, but I'll definitely keep that one in mind if things change.  The biggest problem we have here using an indoor antenna is the houses are all concrete block so using an antenna in an interior room is a gamble.  I currently have the antenna in the window, pointing at the Fox station which is literally five miles away as the crow flies , across flat ground, and it's the only place I can get any kind of signal for that channel.  The rest of the stations are further away and the antenna isn't pointed towards them and they all come in great.  It's frustrating.I'll look into Tablo TV.  I lurk here a lot and it's mind boggling the number of options there are out there for cord cutters now.Thank you very much for your advice.  It's really helpful."
Hulu is now offering its $7.99 plan for $5.99 to new and returning qualified subscribers for a limited time,They really are trying to push their subscriber counts up. This should also show people that they don’t give a crap about their current negative cash flow. These guys are all in. I can imagine Hulu wanting to pump up their sub base as a means to offer s cheaper bundle with Disney next year - which is why this offer is lasting til January and expires after a year. 
Hulu is now offering its $7.99 plan for $5.99 to new and returning qualified subscribers for a limited time,They did this last year and the year before. And it lasted for several months last time too. I got a one year discount last year and got an email a few weeks ago telling me my discount was continuing for this year as well.

"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service","**Note**: the education version of Philo is different than the consumer version of Philo. The edu version has more channels, including locals, sports, and premiums.

"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service","Also DVR seems to be limited to 20 hours, instead of the consumer version's unlimited recordings with 30 day expiry."
"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service","My university did the same thing a few years ago and gave every student a Roku 2.However, our Wi-Fi sucked, so everything was subject to terrible lag. Also - we could only stream when we were on our university’s wi-fi.We had U-Verse before, which was great, because I could use at AT&T login to stream when I wasn’t on campus."
"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service",Why couldn't they reuse the coax to deploy their own high speed wired service which is better for video?

"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service","Damn. When the private universities are saying the cost for cable is too high, maybe it really is time to re-evaluate the entire business model.

"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service","My college got rid of it too. Mostly because no one was using it and Cox wanted the school to pay an individual license for each dorm.Everyone there (it was an expensive private school) had bare minimum a game console or laptop to watch Netflix, YouTube, etc to watch videos. And we were also in the range of the TV towers, so some people also bought antennas to watch free broadcast TV.They said we could sign up for cable ourselves if we wanted, but I don’t think anyone did."
"NYU Got Rid of Cable, Switched to Philo Streaming Service",Philo started out providing cable service to universities. It then branched out to offering a streaming consumer service. This is really totally different and just another contract for its main business.

Guidance for OTA Equipment to obtain and record Live TV,"The simplest is to go purchase a Tivo Roamio, hook it to an antenna, and plug it into the HDMI port of your LG OLED TV.   It's a complete DVR, nothing else needed, has an excellent remote control, and integrates many streaming apps too.    You have to pay a monthly sub or buy a lifetime sub, but it's pretty much plug & play.  Post a TV Fool report here for a recommendation on an antenna for your location. "
Guidance for OTA Equipment to obtain and record Live TV,Thanks! That's helpful. Here is my report:  http://www.tvfool.com/?option=com_wrapper&Itemid=29&q=id%3d903845f8c1aa7c
Guidance for OTA Equipment to obtain and record Live TV,"You have an Nvidia Shield already . . . Simple choice. Get an Hdhomerun, Plex Pass and Nas or External Hard drive and your all ready to go.I assume you have the 16GB model. If you have the pro, you dont even need an external hard drive.That's the route I went with. Just be sure if you have you external hard drive set as internal storage, dont change it out as it screws with Plex server connection big time. I found out the hard way.I upgraded a 500gb hard drive to a 4tb one."
Guidance for OTA Equipment to obtain and record Live TV,airtv or tablo are stand alone tuners that have DVR capablities and apps that will let you watch tv on any smart device.
Guidance for OTA Equipment to obtain and record Live TV,"People that use plex seem generally pretty happy with it, but I don't like the idea or expense of keeping a server running day and night to host content. I \*think\* that can be done now with a smart network storage device instead, but not sure. I've been using a  ChannelMaster DVR+ to stream and record OTA stations and a streaming box (ROKU in my case) to stream OTA content. Another alternative that is intriguing is the AirTV black box. It will stream and now also record OTA channels and stream them to an AirTV app. If your Shield supports that app, you could have everything available through the Shield, which would be nice. Life as a cord cutter isn't simple unless you just hook some rabbit ears or flat antenna to your TV and call it a day. But it can be a fun an adventure."

Streaming is now cable, and can go fuck itself for the same reasons.What do we have now?* Netflix* Hulu* CBS* Disney (soon)* HBO* Amazon* Starz* ESPN* Now AT&T/Warner BrothersCable was successful initially because it was a good deal: good value at a decent price, lots of content (from *everybody*), no commercials.

AT&T plans a new streaming service using Warner Bros. shows and movies,"Cable failed (or is failing), because the bundles got too big and expensive. When they went from $25 a month to 50, 75, or 100 plus dollars a month.I'm not sure what the right marketing move is for AT&T. Bundle HBO, Warner, & DC together for $25 a month, or leave them separate (HBO @ $15, Warner @ $5, & DC @ $5). I'm more likely to try Warner or DC for $5, than to jump on a $25 bundle.HBO is, imho, overpriced, but they've always managed to get away with charging a premium for it, even as a cable add on channel."
AT&T plans a new streaming service using Warner Bros. shows and movies,I'm still good with all this until contracts are introduced then it becomes a big problem.  As it is I'll just switch around and keep my spending flat.  HBO one maybe two months a year.  HULU no commercials one maybe two months a year.  So on and so on..........
AT&T plans a new streaming service using Warner Bros. shows and movies,This already debuted as a standalone service about 5-6 years ago and was called Warner Instant Archive.

Comcast offering $18. Streaming service.,I think it's mostly basic channels for $18 (unless you have their TV service and then you get all the channels). You can get additional packs for like $15 each.
Comcast offering $18. Streaming service.,That's actually a decent deal. The problem is Comcast is notorious for not supporting android tv boxes in almost every way because they compete with their cable boxes. They don't even let you use apps like HBO GO with your Comcast subscription. They seem expect people to just to stream to an iPad or phone. I don't want to watch tv on a damn phone.

Finally cut the cord this week. Here’s the TV Fool report. Recommend an antenna?,The forums certainly are.
Finally cut the cord this week. Here’s the TV Fool report. Recommend an antenna?,"Mohu Sky 60.  I live in zip code 21113 and I get over 50 channels, including all channels from both metro areas surrounding me; and I didn't even have to mount it outside!  The antenna is just sitting on top of a bookshelf in my daughters room (where the existing coax cable comes into the house)!And to improve on your OTA experience, I recommend getting a 4-tuner TabloTV, which is a DVR box and service.  You can pay monthly for the service ($5), or lifetime ($150).  I recommend 4-tuners because I guarantee you will run out (perhaps not often, but you will) during that one night that you happen to be recording 2 shows but don't want to watch either of them.  The Tablo works with almost any streaming media device (roku, amazon stick, chromecast, android tv, etc etc).  As an alternative that I sometimes wish I would have done, you can go with Plex and a HDHomerun DVR.  It's similar, but not exactly the same.  Plex has more features and can integrate your OTA content with your home media (if you have a media NAS, for example) into a single app.  However, I find Tablo to be an easier-to-use app for watching content (simple tv controls are better/easier and more visually pleasing).

Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, FuboTV, and Philo are all great options. Do some free trials and look for the channels you want. I would not recommend Sling and DirecTV Now. "
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,What are your thoughts on YouTube TV?
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"I personally would recommend both sling and DirecTV Now. They are both great services and have amazing channel lineups. Check which service has the channels you MUST have and go with that one. If multiple have them then try the trials one at a time till you find one you are happy with. All are really good, it really comes down to personal preference. "
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,Why not streaming services without live tv? They are much cheaper and most people dont care about watching their shows live.
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"Im with DirectvNow because its free for 3 months. Its not perfect, crashes and looses stream here and there through Fire TV.  Tried Hulu it was about the same quality and channel line up.  I wanted MLB tv and didnt see it on there for the same price as DTN.Going to try Sling and Youtube next. Just make sure whatever you pick has the channels you want with the streaming device you want or have. Seems like there is one draw back to every service. It might be channel line up, pricing or device.  Kinda have to decide in your own. Good thing is you can get free trails to all and cancel at anytime. Be sure you give whatever service a good few days of heavy use to decide. Also check your internet provider caps. I didnt know Comcast has a 1TB cap til i ran over it. I was streaming Tv for back ground noise on multiple TV like i was with Satellite, that eats up data fast."
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"Ignore the advice that EVERYONE is giving you. Nobody can answer your question without more details.Without knowing specifically what you watch, its impossible to know which streaming solution is right for you."
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"DirecTvNow is the best aligned with my viewing choices. Hulu is adding the Discovery channels. I would drop DirecTvNow in a heart beat if some other provider had At&tSportsNet Pittsburgh,  but that’s another story. The IPTV streaming marketplace is very dynamic and changes daily. Competition is fierce, so you should be able to find something suitable for your viewing enjoyment.  First, though, I would nail down your Internet provider and a good Wifi router. "
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,Have you been paying 120 for cable or cable and WiFi 
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"120 for cable alone, cable + wifi + taxes & other Bullshit fees end up being around $195."
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,WiFi != Internet. 
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"Get a Roku. There's lots of free channels on it. A few of them are really good. For me, free Crunchyroll has even been beating out Netflix lately.Netflix has been the best overall paid service bargain for years now (although lately it's done plenty to piss people off; as well as lowered the average quality of their selection, by no longer showing most popular theatrical films of recent years any more (an increasing percentage of their shows can today also be accessed on FREE Roku channels)).A TV antenna is also a good investment for many folks.PS: Get something like the $100 Roku box from Walmart, rather than a stick. For a while they were selling an abysmally slow stick version, that might make users suicidal. Plus, you want it not to crap out on you in only 1-2 years, right? (by getting too slow and crashing too often) So get one of the higher end boxes. Not necessarily the MOST expensive, but maybe 2nd most."
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,I also endorse a Roku as the streaming device.  Tons of free stuff on there.
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,"FWIW, I briefly had the original Stick a couple years ago and, yeah, it was so much worse than my out -of-date Roku XD that one night I ripped it out and broke it. Because of that, I was hesitant to get a Stick+, but did so recently - the Stick+ is fantastic. It's wifi-only yet works better/faster than my Roku 3, which is connected via ethernet.The Stick+ and Ultra are essentially the same, but the latter is an extra $20 for ports (ethernet, etc.). I highly recommend the Stick+ for anyone with reliable wifi."
Potential cord cutter need some advice!,Buy a badass antenna and get on Netflix and Hulu with a good internet connection. You can purchase movies and tv shows you like directly on iTunes/vudu/googleplay if you really wanna watch something badly.

Wireless 5G finally means local broadband competition.  For those in Comcast only areas, we will soon HAVE A CHOICE.

Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,No not really. 5g only has a range of like 1500 ft and fiber will have to be pulled to every pole. And it has even worse Line-of-Sight issues than other lower powered rf technologies. it's not gonna fix our problems.

Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,Yes.
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"""Unlimited ;)"""
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"I can see them adding some form of cap down the road but even if it's 2TB that would be double cable's caps and Verizon still basically has no real caps on FIOS so they understand that caps are a selling point.  It is wireless but for a very short distance much shorter than Starry.  They have no reason to throttle.  The whole idea of using millimeter wave spectrum is the vastly greater amount of data it can transmit.  Its only being transmitted up to 2,000 feet.  Verizon is running their own bundles of 1,700 fibers for all the services they are going to sell in these cities so this is not a bankrupt Sprint fixed wireless running a few contracted T1s to a tower in a field and letting dust settle while they continue to add customers.   Verizon can easily set up a new small cell down the street if customers cluster up an area or just connect an additional fiber to an antenna that has the capacity.  They tested this for two years in 11 cities around the country so they should have had some good real world use to look at before this roll out.  This is Verizon attacking AT&T's home area.  The main products for those 1,700 fibers that will be looped around these cities is business services, the 5G wireless and smart city services (whatever those are Verizon has mentioned them ad nauseum) the 5g fixed residential wireless could well be a loss leader.   "
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"I think you are mixing up your technologies. While 5G can include millimeter wave technology, carriers are just now starting to test. This article specifically states wideband wireless not millimeter wave technology.Also the network transport for wireless backhaul is much more diverse then just a ring of fibers owned by the wireless company (which doesn’t exist most of the time).  It is typically a mix of. 1g and 10gig metro Ethernet  links from providers like Fiber Tower and Local ILECs  back to the wireless providers MTSO (think wireless data center in each market). "

Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,$70 for a non-Verizon customer is kinda steep. I wish they would offer lower speed tiers at lower prices. I would gladly pay $30-$40 a month for 30-50 Mbps internet. 
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,No data caps?  Expect to be throttled.
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,Well this will be insteresting to see if 5G will shake up the ISP market. 
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,And how long until they change the terms of service?
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"until they notice people actually want to use internet without data caps, at that point they will introduce them."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"Verizon's quoted speeds are likely based on a customer at the edge of the 5G area cloud they would be served by - 2,000 feet away from the small cell (likely not line of sight) and the fiber back haul.  The closer you are - the better positioned the wireless router is - the higher your speeds will be."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,So 5G doesn't stand for gigahertz?
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,No. It’s the fifth generation of mobile connectivity. 
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"forgive me if i am mistaken, but,  since it is effectively a ""wireless"" service, they have even less net neutrality obligations than home ""wired"" broadband right?"
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,But will they throttle...
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,so this tech is basically running fiber to the pole and then using a wifi-like transmitter for all the houses in the neighborhood right? so probably worse latency than straight fiber?
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"This confused me, wasn't Verizon one of the major backers to abolish net neutrality? "
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"There should be no caps on normal usage.  Where shit goes wrong is when hoarders attempt to download the entire internet, and it just pushes prices up for everyone else."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,So is it Verizon Wireless Unlimited Data (TM) or is it legit no data cap?  I might actually cut the cord completely finally if this is legit.  I’m one of those people that just keeps cable because it’s not all that much more expensive to keep cable compared to the internet speed tier I want. 
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"I am crossing my fingers 5G will be something really worth my time once it rolls into my area.  I have looked to switch my ISP in the past, but they pretty much all offer the same pricing.  Hopefully, this will shakeup the market a bit."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,The only real problem I see is that it's from Verizon. I don't trust them as far as I can throw em'.
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"I'm excited for it. I already live in a place with fiber and dsl options, but tossing in a wireless option that doesn't price gauge you would be awesome even if the roll out is slow it drives competition. Just wait until Tmo and Sprint follow behind - it will get even more competitive."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,How is the latency on first person shooters on 5g?
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"I live in a town of 10k+ residents. They only have one LTE band (700) deployed here and one tower which means its congested to no end. Dial up speeds. They can't even get that correct, so not holding my breath for their future 5G service."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,What is this home connection?  Another cell link.. a new box? Bonded dsl? Can I call centurylink and threaten to leave?
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,"Basically more broadband options for people in the cities who already have a dozen other options. Wake me up when something like this extends out to the rural areas where the rest of us are at, forced to using only satellite or shitty, un-maintained DSL."
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,> the rest of uswhat a lil bitch 
Verizon's $50 5G Home Internet Service Launching October 1 With No Data Caps,Not impressed.
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"I've pretty much tried them all. Hulu with Live TV is much better than Sling. As far as other services go, Vue, YouTube TV, Fubo, and Philo are great. DirecTV Now is more expensive and unreliable. "
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,Sling is perfect for me and works outstanding.  Not sure how Hulu could be better.
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"Playstation Vue.Seriously, I've tried em all. "
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,Agreed.  Also tried them all.
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"Thanks, but I don't have a Playstation."
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"My daughter and FIL have Vue.  The guide is horrible, at least on Roku."
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"Am trying out YouTube TV Free 7 day Trial ; lots of problems because I have Firestick.Can't use Firestick remote effectively with YTTV ; seems Google & Amazon are enemies.If you use firestick, skip YTTV.I liked HULU with Live TV, however.  Easy to use firestick remote with, lots of channels, easy to set up and use.I really want SOMEONE to offer PBS, though."
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"YTTV doesn't work on FireTV. I have a FireTV household, we use PS Vue "
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,If you need PBS sign up for PBS Passport. It is $5 a month or $60 a year and it is tax deductible. 
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"Good to know, two of our tvs are on a Firestick."
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"I was fine with Sling not long after they went online.  Then they disabled their Windows app and told me I was required to use the Chrome browser.  I told them I don't use the Chrome browser for any reason, because Google uses it to target you with ads.  I cancelled and got Hulu."
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"Performance is tricky. Different services will have varying quality depending on your ISP, your home network setup, etc. You just have to try them out. I have had Sling, DTVN and Vue. I'm still on Vue after 2 years, even with price increases. Note: you certainly don't need a Playstation for Vue but you do need an id for the PS network, which is free, but confusing and kind of a pain. You get used to it. I do think that using their gaming network as the backbone of the streaming service helped their quality and stability. At least in the beginning. "
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,"If you’re looking for smoothness than Sling. It’s the most mature of the services as it’s the oldest, and unlike Youtube and Hulu, Dish knew what it was doimg when starting an OTT service. Hulu had a lot of problems for a while with buffering but a lot of that has been resolved. It’s still has a issues buffering with live sports, but that’s been getting better. Overall though, Hulu is better simply because it comes with Hulu’s streaming catalog "
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,30FPS is smoother than Vue's 60FPS?
Hulu w/Live TV or Sling TV Orange AND Blue,Sling's stream quality is historically the best out of the ones I've used. Vue comes in 2nd. Hulu was awful when I had it. I've heard (generally) that they fixed it but I've also heard that the consistency is still not there.
Discovery Networks coming to Hulu Live TV & Sling TV,"This is fantastic news. Between this and AirTV's DVR going live, I have no reason to shop around for another service. "
Discovery Networks coming to Hulu Live TV & Sling TV,I wounded if they hop on Fubo?
Discovery Networks coming to Hulu Live TV & Sling TV,If the price remains the same for Hulu and Sling they both get a huge boost from this. 
Discovery Networks coming to Hulu Live TV & Sling TV,That Discovery Scripps merger is finally paying off.
Discovery Networks coming to Hulu Live TV & Sling TV,Youtubetv needs to step up now.

CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,"Sinclair had refused to agree to a deal with Hulu regarding about 2 dozen markets unless Hulu also carried the Tennis channel. So instead, Hulu reached a deal with CBS Corp. to offer a national feed of the network in the markets where Sinclair operates a local affiliate.The workaround will let Hulu customers in cities such as Cincinnati and Salt Lake City watch CBS in time for the fall TV season. The national feed features 14 1/2 hours of programming that normally air on CBS, including prime-time entertainment, nightly news and daytime talk shows. CBS will fill local-affiliate time -- 9 1/2 hours -- with CBSN, the company’s digital news network."
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,Similar to what FOX did on Vue. It’s good to see the networks stepping up and trying to get there content out there even when the local stations are not playing nice. 
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,"LOL, another misstep for Sinclair. Didn't realize they owned the Tennis Channel though."
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,All I processed from that was Sinclair bought a channel that serves zero purpose for most of us and now wants to try and make it popular. Zero fucks given for you Sinclair…
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,Tennis channel isn’t even important for us tennis fans. Espn carries the slams and masters tournaments 
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,"Creepiest newscast in town. I don’t think they will be missed except by the True Believers, and even they prefer Fox News. Bad year for Sinclair in general, lost their merger with tribune as well. I actually like tennis channel but it doesn’t get the best games. They should sell it ott, but they just don’t get it..."
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,"I wish they'd sell it OTT. Been trying to get my relatives to drop cable to save money but one of them watches the Tennis Channel all the time, which only YouTube TV($40) and DirectTV Now($55 package) carry."
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,This is beautiful :)
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,"Shouldn't this be titled ""CBS Undercuts its Own Streaming Service""?Instead of making streaming CBS live exclusive to their own service, CBS is selling it to Hulu."
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,They already had an agreement with hulu. This simply expands that ~~street.~~ All of their O and O affiliates and many of their other affiliates have been on Hulu since when Hulu's Live streaming service launched. Hulu also made an agreement with CBS for login credentials a long time ago for those affiliates willing to participate. Not only that CBS is on nearly all of the other streaming services. It actually prefers streaming services over cable TV providers - apparently it earns more from them. (I will see if I can find the news article from this week discussing this.) What they are doing differently is to limit it to live TV only and no on demand or orginals and fewer devices as you need the CBS app and not the CBS All Access app.Edit: autocorrect was trying to help again.
CBS Undercuts Sinclair in the Local-TV Giant's Battle With Hulu,Competition in action is a beautiful thing. :)

Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,It never worked well
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,Good!  Now I don't have to remove the server myself!
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"Never understood this service.  Great for storing large files, but you have to upload them to their cloud first?  If I have a 3 hour NFL game in TS format (about 15 gigs), its going to take me 90 minutes copying it to my phone.  To the cloud, it could take all day and I have the luxury of paying $60 a month for that?Edit: My bad, that's $60 a year, not per month."
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"Well third-party cloud services are not cheap by any means, which probably plays a lot into the fact that they couldn't make any money at it. "
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"EDIT - Redacted, I see where you got the $60/year from.  Not even an option anymore."
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,That nobody uses. Everyone just hosts their own plex box. 
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,I think trying to maintain support for 4 different 3rd party could services may have been its downfall. That's a lot to keep on top of any your users are at the mercy of the other companies pricing as well. Still a sad day to see them abandon hope for the feature
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"Maybe they can actually do something useful, like add Google home support. I've got a lifetime Plex pass and they haven't added a single feature I actually use since I bought in besides hardware transcoding. Which is actually incredibly useful, but it shouldn't have been even a quarter as hard as they made it out to be."
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"Been wanting to get a lifetime Plex pass or whatever they call it, maybe this means they'll reduce the price now... oh who the hell am I kidding."
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,That's a bummer. It actually worked fairly well.
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,"I wonder if they'll be giving any sort of refund to PlexPass subscribers. Honestly, I didn't buy PP for this feature, so I don't really care. But this is a rare misstep for Plex. Curious to see how they message it to paying customers."
Plex Shuts Down Its Cloud Service,I've got plexpass and one of the main reasons was because of the cloud service. So kinda pissed.

DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,[deleted]
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,lol
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,CTRL+ALT+Right Arrow
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,If DirecTV put half the effort into keeping customers as they do on trying to get them back I'd probably still be a DirecTV customer.
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"DirecTV is AT&T now, and AT&T hates everything but profits. Customer service doesn't equate to profits."
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"I totally agree.  After about 20 years with DirecTV never having bill credits that I'm aware of (except a few premium promos) I asked them to lower my bill.  They offered a $10 bill credit (on a $145/month bill I was paying) so I said, ""OK, then cancel.""  Three weeks later they offered to reinstate me for half the cost, $300 in debit cards, and forgive my $350 final bill (two months I owed them.)  I'm back at $60 instead of $145 (but at a lower package.)  A few odd things.  First, retentions chastise me for not calling to get bill credits which according to her customers are always eligible for, so I asked for one and the best she could do was $10 and lower my package to save money.  Second, after canceling me she said ""If you change your mind and want to come back, we have some very attractive promos you can qualify for.""  I asked her, ""Why not just offer those to me now so I don't have to cancel and resubscribe?"" and her answer was vaguely that she doesn't have the ability to do that.  Later I come to find out that retentions doesn't have access to deals that the ""win back"" department does (which is essentially like new subscriber promos.)  This is so backasswards.  Instead of just lower my bill to keep a loyal customer, they took back all of their equipment, rolled truck out to install all new equipment, and ate about $650 in cash in addition to $45 in bill credits for 1 year  All I wanted was to get my $145 bill down to $70 (including lowering my package) which would have amounted to about $40 in discounts.  When my year is up the bill credits expire.  I may pat the ETF and try streaming again.  We'll see how this project Osprey shakes out and how DTV Now or Vue improves (or not.)"
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,I'm in the same boat. Been a DirecTV customer for 8 YEARS and been on auto pay that entire time. Bill nearly doubled and they offered nearly nothing to keep me. Still with them for now but in process of looking for a different tv service provider. 
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,Not me. I prefer over the air television via an external antenna.  An occasional subscription to Netflix and/or Hulu in addition to that is plenty. 
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,I've been getting 1 or 2 those every month for the last 8 years. Sometimes they even send me an expensive looking greeting card with embossed printing. 
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,That's to prevent it from going straight into the shredder.
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"Every week I get a email from them offering a $200 visa gift card for me to sign up, then one week I got an offer for $300, now they are down to $200 again. "
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,Wait til they offer to blow you.  
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"I've been getting this $300 offer for quite a while now. Was a faithful customer for about five years, paying for one of their top packages plus NFL Sunday Ticket every single year. By the time I canceled, I was paying more than $200/month. No amount of rewards or discounts will get me to come back at this point. "
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"Lmao....so that was the offer the guy was trying to explain when i cancelled yesterday.  Then he offered something that sounded like streaming thru the directv.com (not directvNOW, i thought it was that too) that one was supposedly free for 6 months (no equipment just access, prolly a sign in like u can do for amazon channels or something)This year we got a free subscription to sling.com for 6 months, got a nvida shield for streaming and an antenna/hdhomerun for locals.  Once the kids stopped watching directv i was done. Went from $130 / Month to $35 a month for sling, one time antenna/hdhomerun cost of 120ish, $50 a year for a nbc gold sports package and a lifetime plex pass for 120.  (Like many i already had amazon prime for other things so not counting it.)"
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,How did you get Sling free for 6 months?
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"My old cable provider calls me 4 or 5 times a year trying to get me to come back.I ditched them over 5 years ago. And even when I tell them to take me off their contact list, they don't. Then they call again a few months later and we start the whole process again! "
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"I am in the process of dropping DirecTV for DirecTV Now.   It's not a real cord cutting, I suppose, though it does give me much more ease of switching providers in the future."
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"I dropped dtvnow because we needed three streams. But they finally added it for $5 more, so I rejoined and added $5 live hbo, and we split the cost between two households. Have all major local networks costs us about $25 p/m after split.   I enjoy it more than Sling which recently raised its prices and didn’t included cbs on either package."
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"My only problem with that is that Comcast has a data cap.  While you can stay below the 1TB, you can't just leave TV on the way you can with satellite.  On the plus side, the $55 on DTVN is perfect for what I need vs $91 package on DirecTV (when you count the RSN fee) + $45 in HD/DVR/equipment fees ($136 total.)  So DTVN works out better even if I have to pay Comcast $50 more for unlimited streaming (which I use for more than just streaming.)  But the DTVN app is a bit painful to use and the DVR still a bit buggy.  It works well enough but I hope it'll get better.  So because I got a huge discount to go back to satellite, I did for now.  When the price goes back up I'll probably pay the early termination fee and try DTV Now again.  Or by then this project Osprey (DirecTV IPTV) will have launched and I can compare to that."
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,I get similar letters from Dish. There is no way that I am going back. I realized after I had my son that I don't watch all that much TV anymore.
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"That reminds me, Dish used to send me a paper letter about every other day, for years.  Haven't gotten them for a while now, I think I called and told them to quit wasting their time."
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,Noooo don't do it. They WILL RAISE THEIR RATES ON YOU!
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,I had Directv for 7 years until I moved to a townhouse that doesn’t allow satellite dishes. They sent me the recovery box and it said I only had to return one out of the four receivers I had. I called to confirm that was correct. I thought that was the end of it until I get an email a few days later to confirm my installation appointment at my old house in a completely different state. I think the person who answered my question about the boxes also signed me back up. I would have maybe considered going back to them had they not crammed their service without authorization. 
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"When I called to cancel my DirecTV satellite so I can sign up for DirecTV Now, the rep tried to convince me not to go...I'm like, I'm sticking to DTV, just switching modes of broadcast lol. Though he admitted it sounded backwards and he's just doing his job. I think telling him I was signing up for DTVNow made canceling the satellite service easier. But I still get these letters in the mail. "
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,How difficult is it to rotate a picture?
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,"But, you can do the same thing!  How hard is it?"
DirecTV begged me to come back 😓,Blame it on my phone camera

Suggestions on best service to get,"Hulu with Live TV ($39.99) has the locals, ESPN, and HGTV. YouTube TV and Vue don't offer HGTV, but you can pair them with Philo ($16) to get it. FuboTV has a lot of sports channels and HGTV, but no ESPN. No matter which you choose, you can use your account to sign into tv network apps (FX Now, ESPN, Fox Sports Go, NBCSN, etc.). These types of apps can offer sports games and movies/tv shows on-demand, in addition to live channel feeds. Vue and Fubo have the NFL Network and RedZone. Sling's quality is meh. DirecTV Now is unreliable. "
Suggestions on best service to get,"Thanks!  I wasn't sure about using the account to sign into tv network apps, so that's nice to have confirmed.  Thanks for letting me know about the quality of Sling, that was what I was leaning towards, but it's probably a ""you get what you paid for"" type of thing.  I'm going to look into YouTube TV  little more, now that I have a first hand account of Sling's quality."
Suggestions on best service to get,"Do you need DVR capability at all? If so, Hulu Live is gonna set you back an additional $15 a month for a 200 hour DVR with the ability to fast forward and rewind most recorded content. Hulu Live comes with a 50 hour DVR free but that fills up quickly if more than one person will be using the service since the DVR hours are split across all the profiles on the account. YTTV if available in your area likely has your locals and ESPN. YTTV has unlimited DVR and each profile on your account has its own DVR. I had Hulu Live plus Philo (only for the Viacom channels) since Hulu Live carried the other channels I'd use Philo for (HGTV, A&E, Lifetime and Food Network) for a few months. The service was stable but I really didn't like paying the $15 a month for the 200 hour DVR with Hulu Live (it's not just me in my house using the service) plus $4 a month for limited commericals since not everything I watched was available in their on demand.

Indoor antenna recommendations?,">... their transmitters are 40 miles away and the antenna is advertised as having a 60-mile range, Normally you shouldn't expect good indoor reception much over 30 miles over level ground. Claiming that an indoor antenna can receive signals from transmitters 60 miles away is a deliberate attempt to mislead a potential purchaser.Your target signals are coming from the west. Note that some types of insulating windows have a metallic coating that can block TV signals. Can you open the west window (remove any metallic screens) as a test?"
Indoor antenna recommendations?,"Update: I just tried putting the antenna inside of the window (between the metal screen and the glass), and it’s working perfectly! I’m getting CBS, NBC, FOX, ABC, etc. crystal-clear. I guess the glass is reflecting the signal back to the antenna. Thank you for your initial suggestion; it lead me to doing this, and now I’m getting 36 channels!"
Indoor antenna recommendations?,"Thanks for the reply. Yes, I kind of suspected that the 60-mile figure was a marketing ploy. I did some more testing of positions today and I found that in different spots of my west window, I was able to get a clear signal of WNBC, and marginal reception of WCBS, WNYW, and WWOR. The bottom pane of my window has a metallic screen, whereas the top does not; I didn’t notice much of a difference between the two."
Recommendation for Indoor Antenna,I always thought a cleverly hidden outdoor antenna would be cool inside. Like flat against a wall and build a frame around it and add a canvas to cover it. Dumb idea I know. 
Recommendation for Indoor Antenna,"HEY have you been spying on my house?  You just described my 2nd-floor CM4228 installation aiming out a window.(Actually I didn't cover it, because I don't care if people see it.)"
Recommendation for Indoor Antenna,"You have nice strong signals, so try a Winegard Freevison.  If ABC on VHF-7 doesn't come in, then try a CM4228."
Recommendation for Indoor Antenna,"Do you think the winegard free vision would work better than the winegard flatwave FL-5000, particularly for the Hi-V channels?"
Recommendation for Indoor Antenna,"For VHF, rabbit ears are where it is at for indoors. Available locally from most any discount store.You can try building something:* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j80C9d1o9Y* http://imageevent.com/holl_ands/multibay/4bay/superm4?p=3&n=1&m=-1&c=3&l=0&w=1&s=0&z=4 (mclapp dimensions)... although the mclapp design probably doesn't have much better VHF-high performance than rabbit ears."

FCC data exaggerates broadband access on tribal lands. Inaccurate data makes it hard to get broadband money to where it's most needed.,"Yes it appears ISPs have been lying, in order to protect their monopolies.  For example in west Texas, ATT has been claiming ""4G wireless internet access"" in areas that barely receive any cellular signal.This is simply a way for corporations to protect their existing monopolies from new competing companies receiving FCC funds."

Live MTV and/or record capability?,Is Philo full HD? 
Antenna or Streaming Service?,Honestly not optimistic. You need a rooftop antenna and everything is a two edge signal meaning they are bouncing off objects to get to you. It may not be reliable.
Antenna or Streaming Service?,"Not ""bouncing off objects"".  It means he has 2 mountain or hill ridges between him & the stations (2 edges).  I'd recommend this for the best reception: http://dennysantennaservice.com/hd_stacker_tv_antenna-html.html"
Antenna or Streaming Service?,"The devil is in the details. What height did you provide for this report? Signals are generally reasonably good for your zip code. If you entered an antenna height of 5 feet for your report then you might want to redo the TVfool report using the highest height you can install an outside antenna at. If you already entered an antenna height of 50 feet though, then even an outside antenna probably isn't going to work very well for you. Good luck."

Antenna or Streaming Service?,"Does your ISP have a bandwidth cap?  Will you watch enough to go over it?  If not, then I'd probably just do streaming.  Otherwise you'll want OTA to reduce your bandwidth usage to stay under the cap especially if you want to leave the TV on all day.  At the very worst pick up the most used channel(s) if you can't get them all and use that in conjunction with streaming.  Also keep in mind that OTA has no DVR unless you get a Tivo, Tablo, or Homerun so you'll have to factor in the cost of one of those if you care.  Streaming services have DVRs and Vue's is excellent for use in a 30 day window.  Or Hulu Live TV might be ideal for the combination of Hulu, live, and DVR but it'll cost a bit more (but you get a bit more.)"
Antenna or Streaming Service?,"Overall, I used to have a setup using OTA using an HD Home Run and small antenna when I lived in an apartment a couple years back. I still have the HD Home Run and antenna, but wasn't picking up much (it is one of those flat ones). Just wondering if a bigger Antenna in the attic or on the roof would work better to get OTA signals. I have an extra PC for running my Plex Server with a Life Time Plex Pass to use as a DVR if needed.When I bought my new home, AT&T offered a bundle deal. I went ahead with it. Now the deal is over and they are jacking the price up a bit. I'd rather get rid of them (except for their internet as the only other ISP in my area is Comcast and they have a 350GB cap). Once I cancel the TV, the unlimited cap will be changed to 1TB. It is just me in the house so I doubt I would ever come close to that cap (unless I worked from home more).I use the internet for:\-Playing an MMO (Warcraft)\-Surfing the net/buying stuff\-Checking Emails\-Watching YouTube\-Watching Twitch\-Work (sometimes I work from home and use a VPN to connect to the office)The only streaming service I currently use is CrunchyRoll to get subs of Anime as they release episodes in Japan. I got bored with Netflix so I cancelled it. I do have Prime, but don't find too much on it to watch (other than 1-2 original series). I watch the major networks (ABC/Fox/NBC/CBS) for News, Sports and Reality Shows. There are a few networks I like to watch (but can live without if need be):\-Discovery\-History\-HGTV\-Comedy CentralLet me know what you think.Thanks for the help.&#x200B;"
Antenna or Streaming Service?,"Personally, I get the thrills when it comes to catching difficult and faraway signals, but that is just me.You will spend some money, that is for sure. Either if you go the streaming or OTA route. But, since I do not know your broadband constrains, I would consider OTA. For the amount of money you will pay for a yearly streaming service, you can get local TV with a top notch outdoor antenna. This of course is only valid if you have access to a rooftop where you can place a multidirectional antenna at the highest position available. Ratholes do not apply. Some models were mentioned in a previous reply, so like retail commerce, OTA tv is all about location, location, location (of your antenna). There are also videos on youtube about how to install two high gain antennas for improved reception. Good luck!"
Antenna or Streaming Service?,"I personally like over-the-air more than streaming.  (1) OTA is free.  (2) OTA has lots of older shows that I enjoy, ranging from the 1950s to 1980s.  (3) The absolute cheapest [multi-channel] streaming service still costs $25 (slingtv) unless you go with Hulu or Amazon Prime for $7/month..... but Hulu/Amazon is delayed broadcast not liveOverall I recommend OTA plus amazon or hulu."

And also the increase of towers needed for coverage.I'm sure most people would be stoked to have it just because we all use our phones a lot and would like them to work at our speed, not the speed of our connections.

You can view and record not only with Silicon Dust’s own apps—which are pretty mediocre, IMO—but also with apps like Plex and Channels. I have an HD Homerun and it actually lets you do a 2 minute preview of the streaming channels. Based upon that (and other online comments), I can tell you that the streaming quality is not particularly good. The other day I flipped between Avengers streaming on USA Network on the HD Homerun and YouTube TV. I can’t cite exact resolutions, frame rate or bit rate, but the YTTV image was clearly superior. HDHR looked much more compressed, grainy, etc. It was disappointing because the primary appeal of the HDHR is getting the high quality antenna feed for local networks. But there’s little value in trading slightly improved PQ on 5-6 stations for poorer quality on dozens of others. Also they only carry one feed (east vs west) for most streaming channels. One that comes immediately to mind is Paramount Network (Spike.) I live in the east but they only carry the west coast feed. Any shows I watch on there would be time delayed 3 hours compared to the rest of the east. There’s a full list of these variances on the silicon dust website."
HD Homerun Premium reviews?,If you have a media server I would get it. If not I would get the Tablo DVR. Also if you use a Roku get the Tablo as they don't have a native Roku app. 
HD Homerun Premium reviews?,I love it!! The quality looks fine to me and it works on practically any device with no login needed. The DVR and interface could be a little more user friendly but it gets the job done.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","You might get some suggestions here, but since this isn't really a cordcutting-specific question, you'll be better off posting this over at /r/homenetworking.

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",Make sure it is on their approved list.  Every provider has a page that they list as compatible.  I would start there.  If you are using a combo device make sure you change the un passwords.  And if you use the combo with wireless make sure you change the ssid info.  
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",The modem has to be in the list not the router ...get a cisco ...never rebooted mine in 5 years.... before that every router was fine 6 month then needed to be rebooted ocasionnaly
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Yup, Comcast has a website where you either log in with your username or plug in your ZIP code and Internet speeds and it spits out all the compatible devices.

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",Arris Surfboard with Docsis 3.1 (for future Gigabit speeds when it's available near you).Can't go wrong with this one.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","I like the Asus routers myself. As far as the modem goes, just make sure it's gonna work with your isp. There are approved lists out there probably on their website. At least docsis 3.0"

Cox came out, plugged their modem in and I got close to 300. They said its my equipment, even though the surfboard 6183 is on their approval list for 300Mbps. I have no choice but to rent theirs..."
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",What did they give you? They probably just game you one with more than 16 channels downstream.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Just go to amazon and google ""comcast certified"".Modems have channels, more channels the faster the internet. If you aren't buying gigabit service, there's no reason to buy the most expensive modem."
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Yes on this approach. I found a good netgear one that was decent, but not top of the line. It is sooooo much more reliable than the Comcast one. ROI was less than a year. Can’t recommend buying your own router enough. "
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",depends on your speed. future proof yourself with a docsis 3.x modem. arris is a good brand. read reviews of routers. your needs are known only by yourself. and never buy a combo

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",My cord cutting solution was to switch to Internet services like YouTube TV and Amazon Prime movies.  Replace that cable company hardware with Roku boxes.  The YTTV app on Roku is excellent.  The free Roku Media Player can play your local LAN media storage.  This has worked out very well.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","I don't think modems really matter much. Just make sure it works with Comcast. As for a router, I bought a [Netgear Nighthawk](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/r7000.aspx) and it changed my life. My old router would bog down when multiple people were streaming. This one is built for it. It isn't cheap but worth it if you can afford it. I can stream hd while playing wow, while the kid is playing fortnight and her mom is streaming netflix with no problems. I also have super fast internet though. "
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","I switched to my own modem/router last week, doing it on the cheap and in conjunction with an ISP change to WOW. I bought a modem from WOW's approved list, Zoom 5345 from Amazon for $50ish and paired with a Belkin N450 that has completed it's college term. So far things are very good and the set up was easy enough and far less anxiety producing than preinstallation concerns. Edit: Started small due to smaller home, three people, moderate internet/streaming tv use, and a willingness to invest in equipment upgrades if necessary."

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Really not worth the headache. If you own your own modem, and have any sort of internet problems, the first words out of their mouth will always be blaming your modem."
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",You have the right to insist on a service visit whether they try to blame your third party router or not.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Comcast might be different but I never had an issue with Twc, Charter, or Spectrum. I bought my own modem in 2013. I had a brief 1 year non use because Spectrum gave free modems with service and you wouldn't get any sort of credit if you didn't take it. "

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",Arris modem and Netgear Nighthawk router hands down. There are several Nighthawk routers. If you have a fairly small space such as an apartment or small house then the R7000 should be good. To cover a big house or other large space step up to the X6. 
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","The modem you purchase will depend on your speed tier. Higher speed tiers require modems with more channels. The router is the heart of your network, so buy the best one you can afford. With that said, there are some very good routers in the ~$100 range.

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","Can we just make it so all providers have to use the same modems and put an end to all of this garbage?

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","To each their own, but I have an Arris Surfboard. Decent price. Docsis 3.0, so speeds are pretty good. I’d not get a combo. The modem tech moves muvh more slowly than the WiFi tech does Also I’d recommend modems, plural. The current model is “buy the most powerful and let it shout all over”. I’m not in a dense area and I regularly see 15 SSIDs or so. With signal attenuation and competition, prepare to have to buy Multiple APs"
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",People wonder why you don't the most powerful one available.Well... I don't want my network exposed to half the neighborhood. If my wifi signal is unreachable at my exterior wall and I have a solid signal everywhere else I did a good job.

"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",What's your budget?
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","As others have said, Comcast has a list of approved modems, DO NOT DEVIATE.  They are already a pain about blaming your modem if there is ever a problem, so you want to stay within their list of approved devices.  I went with the ARRIS Surfboard SB6141 because I read somewhere that it’s the modem that’s been in the Xfinity/Motorola combo that you rent for years.   Nothing fancy, and it works just fine.  The router kind of depends on your house and how much coverage you need, maybe to a lesser extent how many devices you are using.   I was all about getting a mesh system for optimal coverage, and although expensive, I was going to get the Oomi by Netgear, they are super fast and have a third band dedicated just so the different routers can talk to each other.   Had a friend in the business politely tell me that was crazy overkill, and I got a Netgear Nighthawk AC1900 router, and couldn’t be happier.  Covers my entire house and a good bit of yard.  Plenty of strength to stream to 2 tvs upstairs and on the complete opposite side of the house (wiring in my house is garbage so I really only had one good place to put the router in the corner of the house, definitely not ideal).  And cost about half of what I would have spent on the mesh system.  "
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","I just (1 week ago) cut the cord from FIOS and went to the 100/100 mbps plan - internet only. We returned the router and bought the OnHub from google. We're very happy so far. Highlights; 1) Speed is incredible, I get full 100 mbps download and upload from almost everywhere in my house (2,400 sq. ft. single family). 2) It was super easy to setup using their app. 3) Monitoring/adjusting/tweaking is a breeze via the app. I can give guest wifi codes, prioritize devices, see which devices are connected and their bandwidth usage, etc... 4) The price was very fair - $99 and 2 day shipping from AmazonOverall, I have no complaints, but it's only been a week so take that with a grain of salt. I will say the reviews are overwhelmingly positive and there are thousands of them. I highly recommend the OnHub if you're looking for a high performance and customizable router. EDIT: It looks like it's back up to $125 [on amazon](https://www.joinhoney.com/shop/amazon/p/B013ALA9LA/Google-WiFi-Router-by-TP-Link---OnHub-AC#price-history). I'd probably still pay $125 for it, but if you can wait for a sale, you could save some $. "
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",I'm doing exactly this with Verizon as my tv/internet plan ends in 30 days and I'm going to the same 100/100 internet only plan. Of course they tell me they want the router back that I'm not even renting from them and want to have me instead rent a new one so I was in the market for a new router. I may look no farther thanks to you. The only thing I'm debating now is where I to put it in my house. My office is in the far corner of the house and it's pretty nice looking so I could move it elsewhere... Or put it in the attic lol.
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",In the same boat. Will keep checking back to see suggestions. 
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",Whatever they sell at your local Costco. Then you still get the benefit of renting if it shits the bed. I think that would be a reasonable exchange if it stopped working in the next 2-3 years and not considered taking advantage of Costco's return policy. 
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","I rent mine (from Comcast) because I've gone through 4 in the last 5 years.If you live in an area with a *lot* of lightening it's really not such a bad deal. (And yes, mine is on a good surge protector, I think the *zap* is coming in over the coax.)"
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?","You’re still likely at a loss in this scenario. 5 years x $10 per month rental = $500. Versus 4 decent routers at $99 each = $396. No criticism, but just rather pointing out how quickly the rental fees add up. "
"I want to get my family to stop renting the Comcast router, so which modem/router (preferably separate instead of combo) should I look into?",You can surge protect your coax as well.

DAZN now live in the US,"I wouldn't sign up if you want Bellator. It's being simulcast with Paramount Network. Bellator 205, 207 and 208 anyway. 206 is DAZN exclusive.Agreed. I'm not signing up until the Joshua fight. That will cover the Vargas fight too."

Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,Easy answer to this.   Post a TV Fool report and we will help you pick an antenna that will work for your location.   We've been doing it here for years now.  Never any complaints.  
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"I already picked an antenna.... Winegard Freevision.  It cost me a lot more dollars, but at least it's rock solid.  (instead of the shitty rabbit ears)"
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,Are rabbit ears still a thing?
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,This pair of rabbit ears is the best antenna I've had. Much better than the flat antenna I used to use.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005QCD0GS/ref=psdc_172665_t3_B00009W3E2
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"Most people I know here in Syracuse, NY are able to get by with just the cheaper RCA rabbit ears. People only upgrade to the more expensive ones if they need to."
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,Rabbit ears are for mostly VHF frequency’s. Where are you that any significant VHF is still broadcast?In North America  the digital conversion pushed most broadcasts to UHF which requires a different antenna type predominantly. There are some combo antennas that have the metal circle plus the rabbit ears but it is mostly the metal circle that receives the UHF. Regardless if you have anything like this get something better. 
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"Huh, I guess that explains why rabbit ears are working better for me. All my stations are still VHF except for ABC/Fox."
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,NE Ohio has 2 major networks on VHF. I thought everyone was supposed to switch to UHF.
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"Yeah well ""rabbit ears"" is just shorthand.  My antenna also included a UHF loop.  As for what is broadcast on VHF in my area?  Channel 6, channel 8, channel 10, channel 11, channel 12, and channel 13 in the Baltimore/Philadelphia region.- Why do some people assume ""VHF is no longer used""?  There's still lots of stations of VHF."
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,I have a tablo networked tuner with a flat bar shaped antenna that I don’t really have to touch pick up my 17 local channels perfectly. But the cost to entry is a bit more than just antenna and go imo so worth it though. 
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"I live in the middle of a city so even a cheap $20 antenna from best buy picks up like 60 channels in perfect quality. I don't have to adjust anything. To be fair, most of those stations are Korean and Mexican. "
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,Sounds like San Diego or Los Angeles.  In my Santa Ana apartment I too get a ton of Spanish and Chinese channels.
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,I use a bar antenna.  I didn't know anyone still used rabbit ears. 
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,I never have to adjust mine.
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,I never adjust them. They sit behind the upstairs TV and never have an issue. Work as good as a roof top. 
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,Rabbit ears are way easier to adjust than something that hangs on the wall. Most people don't want to have to adjust the indoor antenna when they change channels but sometimes you don't have a choice.
Rabbit Ear Users - don't you get tired of constantly adjusting them?,"Yeah I'd rather have an Adjustable antenna (rabbit ears or Freevision) than a damn Nonadjustable flatwave that just hangs on a wall.   BTW your flatwave will work better hanging off a window.  Walls contain metal framing that block signals, whereas windows are ""holes"" from the point of view of antennas.  Most windows don't block light (the EM spectrum)."
Hulutv,The big problem with Hulu Live TV is that it's probably the most cable-like of the streaming MVPDs. They charge you for *everything*. Want to do more than 2 streams at once? Pay more. Want to fast forward through commercials on DVR? Pay more. And so on.
Hulutv,I remember thinking Hulu tv was too expensive. I had YouTube TV for a while and I liked it. It was $40 a month and had a promo at the time for a free chromecast.
Hulutv,That's because it somewhat is. All the add-ons increase the costs.
Hulutv,"Well first, do you have Hulu’s streaming service?"
Hulutv,Yes. I have the basic Hulu. 
Hulutv,"Ok, here's my issue with Hulu. First off I'll let it be known, I hate watching commercials. It's a waste of my time and I have no problem paying extra to watch shows without  commercials. I originally had Hulus basic service without commercials. When Hulu live finally got my local channels, I tried switching from Sling Blue and CBS All Access to Hulu as this would combine my services and be just a little cheaper.I liked the concept of Hulu live, that the focus is more driven on the TV shows you watch and not the channel.My issue that forced me away from using them is that Hulu Live forces you to watch your shows via a DVR, so you have to watch the commercials for every episode. I even tried their Live without commercials option and a couple of shows didn't have commercials but the far majority made you watch your shows from DVR. I ended up cancelling it while I was within the trial and went back to what I originally had."
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,Shouldn’t be blacked out. Sign up for a free trial to confirm. I’d like to say that streaming is the same as cable but there are some unexpected blackouts because TV networks didn’t have the foresight to secure streaming rights along with OTA. Miss America pageant was blacked out for many. Chicago sports fans have some issues with baseball. NFL preseason doesn’t stream in many markets. But these are all the exception rather than the rule. 
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,"Ah, yeah, that makes sense. And good call about the free trial. I'll be sure to set that up here pretty soon. Thanks! "
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,Only Sling does because they refuse to carry Big Ten Network. 
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,Try PlayStation Vue. Best streaming device for sports. You will get all Big10 games (Overflow)Just get at least the core package and above
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,"You should be able to get the other games through the BTN2GO app or the Fox Sports Go app (works better) with your Hulu live log in. If you want to view both games at once through a streaming tv service, Vue is the only service that offers that ability as they have BTN alternative channels.http://btn.com/btn-gamefinder/ to find out which game you'll get through Hulu live."
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,"I live in Iowa, and for the first game of the season, Hulu was showcasing Penn State game, instead of the Hawkeyes on the BTN channel.Not sure what the issue was since normal cable subscribers recicieved the game on BTN"
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,"Hmm...that makes me nervous. I guess, if by Saturday, I’m running into a similar issue, I’ll cancel my trial membership. "
Does Hulu TV black out Big Ten Network live games?,I'm also an Iowa fan. On ps vue it showed the Penn state game for all b10 channels but it was actually the Iowa game for the main channel. 
How's HDHomerun Premium TV?,Meh. Mediocre resolution. The time zone issue for East Coast people is the biggest issue IMHO. It’s a great concept but I think has a lot of room to improve before I would consider it. 
How's HDHomerun Premium TV?,"The PQ has improved since day one, good enough for me. I don’t mind the time zone issues since I’m at work most of the time and so it doesn’t become an issue. I just love now being able to access all the networks I watch with the channels app."
How's HDHomerun Premium TV?,"I have the hdhr and use the channels app on my appletv 4k. Their last update puts the streaming guide for their premium tv lineup in the channel guide of the channels app, which is really cool!. It allows me to preview each station for about 3-4 minutes without purchasing anything or signing up for a trial. I've only done it 3-4 times, quality seemed fine but I would have to spend more time with it to give you a more accurate view. I'll do that for next few days and give you feedback. I have a hurricane headed my way, so might be 4-5 days!"
How's HDHomerun Premium TV?,"I've sampled several of their live channels and found the picture quality to be pretty bad. Lots of pixelation/macroblocking, especially during fast-moving scenes. Also note that it's only 30 frames per second (traditional cable/satellite is 60). That's not a big deal for scripted TV shows and movies (which are all filmed at an even lower framerate, 24) but motion in stuff like sports, news and talk shows may look choppy to you.&#x200B;But the nice thing is that, if you have an HDHomeRun tuner, you automatically have free access to live previews of all these streaming channels. The previews are the same actual streams you'd be getting if you subscribed, it's just that they cut off after about 3 minutes."
How's HDHomerun Premium TV?,It shows promise but right now it's not worth getting.  Time zone issue on those nine channels is the biggest issue.  That will only affect you if you're on the east coast though.  Second issue being the low bitrate.  It 2.5 meg 720p which is half the bitrate of PSVue.  You can see artifacts on the demo channels.  Third issue which isn't that big really but the channel selection sucks.  No DisneyJr or NickJr.  No NFL network.  No Big Ten network.  It's missing a lot of channels.If they can fix the first two issues at least.. I'll try it out.  Mainly because it works with Plex.  That means that Plex plugin that lets you view your HDHomeRun tuner for your friends will work with it.  You can broadcast out your cable service to your friends for free.  Granted you only get four tuners so you shouldn't tell all your friends about it.  Just your close ones.

Cox Cable - Other Fees and Surcharges - FCC Guidelines? what?,Comcast here is an out the same. The told me the fee was tax to which I said that’s a bold lie cuz it’s obviously not. They further “explained” or lied and said it was because of the 1996 telecommunications act. The acts purpose is to increase competition by having local channels available. This doesn’t cost them anything to do the local channels don’t charge a license fee they need the air time (I was angry enough at the time to look into all this). I couldnt think of anything to do but cancel.
Cox Cable - Other Fees and Surcharges - FCC Guidelines? what?,maybe report to the BBB? FCC? I am a week into my new service ... I could cancel but my next internet option is 1/2 the speed.frustrated is an understatement 
Cox Cable - Other Fees and Surcharges - FCC Guidelines? what?,"same situation here, they never give us a notice about increasing fees but luckily we had another option and switched to an att fiber reseller and pay with no additional fees"
Cox Cable - Other Fees and Surcharges - FCC Guidelines? what?,"Same here, quoted $110 for my package but bill is $143.  Those 2 charges you mentions plus other taxes are the difference.  I could drop the TV channels, but I use Cox to login to other apps (like HBO, ESPN, etc) so it’s still worth it, but definitely frustrating..."
Cox Cable - Other Fees and Surcharges - FCC Guidelines? what?,"At least they didn’t hit you with a $10 HD TECHNOLOGY FEE. (Yes, that’s a real Comcast charge for those on certain TV plans). Imagine that, being charged an extra $120 per year for the privilege of watching TV in HD. Great thing about OTT streaming (DTVN, Vue, Sling, YTTV, etc) is that they don’t charge these absurd fees. The only additional tax is perhaps sales tax. "
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,"Honestly, it's a design flaw with the Channel Master DVR. My parents got one and had the same issue; they switched to a TiVo OTA and never looked back. I would look at other options."
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,"Didn't the Channel Master DVR used to be known as the DTVpal DVR?  If so the tuner was made in 2008 and is severely out of date (old tech).   I would upgrade to a better DVR, or a better antenna that is bigger.- BTW ""signal strength"" doesn't mean much.  Example: You might be at a concert with loud blaring music (coming in nice & strong) but cannot understand a word the guy is saying, because there's too much distortion (the sound quality is low).  Same with digital signals which can be strong, but they are full of distortion, so the image is undecodable.  Too many errors."
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,I use a tablo in Southern Oregon and it works great for me to get locals via my Apple TVs.
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,"The dvr+ has problems with multi path interference. Some people have reported that using a splitter or an attenuator / resistor thing can improve it.  Not sure what they are really called. For my weaker signals from towers 63 miles away the dvr+ works better than my Samsung tuners in the tv, so it's not a design flaw per se. There are plenty of reports of If being better than a Tivo for individual setups. If you look on tv fool and see a warning about those stations and possible interference from other stations that might be the case also. If you have an amplifier on the antenna, try it without the amp.That's a couple of things to try. There's a DVR+ forum on AVS that is really active and had some great, helpful his that are a lot more technical than I am."
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,I have a channelmaster DVR+ and no issues whatsoever. But all my stations are at 100%. There is some loss of signal as they have two tuners instead of the one your TV has. So you will need a better antenna or cleaner signal sometimes for the DVR+.
Channel Master DVR Degrading local Networks,Different tuners deal with bad signals differently. So what are you using for an antenna and how high is it?

If you're in a relatively urban or suburban area, go to walmart and buy the cheapest $7 one that have and see how it goes. The higher the better and closer to a window can help. If it's not enough, take it back and try again. Might not be worth it if you know you're in the middle of nowhere, but otherwise don't spend what you don't have to."

If the guy's been blowing ~$100/month on cable, he can afford to blow $50 to $100 on a QUALITY antenna (especially since it's just a one-time purchase).  In general bigger is better, but that does mean having to spend more than $10 on shitty rabbit ears that you have to constantly adjust & mess with."

Antenna cuts out only during NFL games,"My antenna did the same thing. It would pull in the evening news or whatever reruns were on just fine, but as soon as House M.D. or football games would come on, the signal would break up and freeze.I figured it had something to do with using a different HD broadcasting format for those shows."
Antenna cuts out only during NFL games,"I think this is more likely true than anything else.  I think the NFL broadcasts are higher res, higher frame/hertz rate, higher bitrate, something.  I didn't have trouble with the reception, but when I had a low-powered HTPC, it had trouble playing it back the NFL broadcasts, when everything else played back fine."
Antenna cuts out only during NFL games,The format should not be changing. What the issue most likely is is that you are getting too weak of a signal or too strong of a signal if you are close to the transmitter sites.

Antenna cuts out only during NFL games,Could it be because more people are tuning in to that channel than usual?
Antenna cuts out only during NFL games,"No. Unlike WiFi or cell phones, broadcast television is a one way signal.

Just set up attic Clearstream 2V w/ pre-amp but not getting channels,Yes
Just set up attic Clearstream 2V w/ pre-amp but not getting channels,ok so I am late to the game and there were a lot of great questions and answersI am going to try to pull them together and add my own part&#x200B;first thing is you want to test the antenna and amp direct to the TVso get a long piece of coax and if you have a small tv you can position near the opening of the attic that would be cool if not you need to run one long enough to reach your tv..See if your setup works.. no splitters.Next if it works you want to use the signal indicator on your tv to set the position of the antenna to its best direction for the best reception.. it might just be a nudge in any direction that you need for the best signal. Pick a weak station on your tvfool report to do this.. the strong ones you won't have problems with.&#x200B;Ok so it works and you get good signal.. now your home's wiring.If a splitter is used anywhere on the line from the injector to the antenna it will block the voltage getting to the antenna.. UNLESS its a bidirectional AND power passing splitter.. they are harder to find than you might think .. there are a ton for satelite dishes and you can screw yourself on those...[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JPEA](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JPEA)see how each port says in-out and its also DC/IR power passing on all ports? thats what you should look for.. it just makes life easier&#x200B;to tell if you are getting power at your antenna its not hard you just need a voltage tester if you live near harborfreight you can get one free (with **any** purchase)[https://www.hfqpdb.com/best\_coupon/7+FUNCTION+DIGITAL+MULTIMETER](https://www.hfqpdb.com/best_coupon/7+FUNCTION+DIGITAL+MULTIMETER)go up to the wire going into the antenna amplifier and test on the center wire and the outside screw on part.. you should get somewhere between 12 and 18volts DC.. make sure the tester is set on DC.&#x200B;if you got that and your inserter is placed at your tv and its shooting power up to the amplifier then you should be getting signal..&#x200B;like others have said you can also test without the amp and maybe thats fine.. just remove the inserter and go directly to the antenna in the attic instead of passing through the amp.A dead amp or an amp that isn't getting power will shut down all signal from the antenna.. Its a good way to know your amp is dead if you get no signal .. but your amp is probably not dead.a bad wire .. a bad crimp on a wire.. that can cause problemsI bought a Channel Master Preamp that came with a cable but the cable wasn't crimped correctly .. it was the small inserter cable from the power supply to the inserter.. so I replaced that and it worked fine.so idk if i missed anything.. and others have touched on other things&#x200B;good luck

Just set up attic Clearstream 2V w/ pre-amp but not getting channels,"Sounds like you need to get a toner so you can trace the lines out. Tag everything out clearly. Pull each wallplate and make sure they didn't have any additional hiding splitters or bad connections.

"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","I have a HD Homerun and use it primarily with the “Channels” app on Apple TV.  Takes less than 2 seconds to tune a new channel. Note that I am NOT using any DVR features right now. I did previously and don’t have any recollection of a significant delay when tuning recordings. Shows would have to buffer for a few seconds before I could effectively Fast Forward. To the best of my recollection, it would start playing within a couple of seconds but there would be a longer delay before skipping ahead. The default Silicon Dust app is pretty awful. I’ve sampled that on Mac, iPad and Xbox. It works, but the design is not very user friendly. "

As much as I care about the content, the Tablo is perfect and I don’t have to pay monthly to use the DVR functionality. "
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",I had a Tablo when they first came out then sold it and bought a HDHomerun when Plex started supporting them.  No regrets on my end.
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",I did the same thing. The Tablo was fine but Plex supporting HDHR was a game changer for me. Much more wife approval. It also works perfectly with the Live channel built into Android TV.
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","This is exactly the reason I went with the HDHomerun, watching OTA on my Apple TV using the Channels app. Changing channels is very quick and smooth (I especially love being able to double-click the Play button on the remote to get the previous channel ... very helpful when I'm switching between 2 different channels while watching sports).I was considering Tablo, but every review stated the significant lag time when tuning to a new channel. Not needing a DVR, I went with HDHomerun and have been very happy."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",Didn’t know about double-clicking Play to go to the previous channel... thanks for the info!
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","One more vote here for the Channels DVR app. I'm running the DVR on my Synology NAS, but there are tons of options for how to run it. It is paired with the HDHR Quatro and Nvidia Shield TV for my lone set top box. The Channels client reportedly works quite well on FireTV also. This solution is rock solid and much better native picture and sound quality compared to Tablo. This was good enough to kick Tivo to the curb, save money, and gain features."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","Yes, the lag time be greatly reduced if you use the HD Homerun client app.You don't have as many features with the HDHR app, though, so you may want to use some other software such as Emby or Plex. I've been using Emby and like it so far.What's going to impact your speed the most is whether or not your set-up needs to transcode the live feed. One of the reasons why Tablo is so slow is that it transcodes everything. An HDTV over-the-air broadcast comes in over the coax at 21mbps in mpeg format. Tablo can't simply resend what it's receiving natively, it transcodes all of it first to a smaller bit rate (8mbps, I believe).Because you're leaving Tablo to speed things up, you need to make sure the solution you implement doesn't require everything to be transcoded or else you're not going to be a whole lot better off.  A good solution I've found is using a 4 Tuner HDHR with Emby running on an Intel QuickSync capable CPU with Amazon Fire TV boxes as the clients at each TV.  Unlike Roku, the Amazon Fire can natively handle mpeg, which is great bc this allows the broadcast to come in through the HDHR and get routed through Emby in it's native format with no transcoding. It's extremely quick and of course the picture quality is perfect.Transcoding is a terrible thing for live broadcast OTA television inside a house. It slows everything down, you lose the original broadcast quality and it's ridiculous when you could just plug the coax directly into a television and get perfect quality quickly. Tablo really needs to implement some type of non-transcoding solution for inside a home network or at least some type of pass through to a nearby television. 90% of your live TV viewing will be in your home and it's just a dumb solution to require all of it to be transcoded and compressed down to a smaller size.Transcoding has its place, though. If you want to watch live TV outside your home network then it will have to be transcoded if your upload speed from your home network is less than 21mbps. Also, if you are watching your TV on a cellphone on your carrier's data plan then you don't want to chew up a whole month's data cap watching streaming TV @ 21mbps on a small screen where you can't even tell the difference between that and 4mbps. Emby is very easy to set up and you can force it to transcode only those streams you play outside of your home network. I have Emby set to transcode any of those streams down to 4mbps before sending them over the internet to my phone. You also probably want to use transcoding for the things you record to save space and facilitate easier playback later whether at home or on the road. For those use-cases you'll want to have a server that can get its hardware involved to help with the transcoding process. Intel CPUs that have QuickSync can do hardware transcoding. With only a 2 tuners going, an Intel Dual Core i5 QuickSync CPU should be adequate. But with a 4-tuner set-up I would recommend more power. Also, using a SSD to do the transcoding and run Emby is recommended although I'm just using a regular old laptop drive."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",Thanks for the thorough reply!
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","Have had the Homerun for a couple years now; tremendous device. Superfast channel switching, even with the native app."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",I like both but wanted dvr and a native app so tablo app on Apple TV plus dual lite works great and makes my dtvn package complete. 
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",I've had both and the Tablo is on a shelf in a closet in the basement.I recommend Tablo for those that are intimidated by technology. Everyone else should go HD Homerun.
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","I tried a Tablo for a little while but also found the lag time when switching channels to be a deal-breaker. For me, the Tablo was only good for recordings, not live TV. I sold it and bought an HDHomeRun, which I use with the Channels app on my Apple TV 4K for live TV. I use open-source MythTV for DVR recordings but setting it up and maintaining it are not for the technically disinclined -- it's basically a little DIY hobby project. If I were going to pay for DVR service, I'd probably go with a lifetime Plex Pass (which also supports live TV now too). The Channels app does offer DVR service that looks very well done (one month free trial with free app install too) but it's a monthly or annual fee, no lifetime service option. The SiliconDust app looks pretty rough."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","yeesh. very happy with my hdhr prime in terms of channel switching speed (primary viewing environment is android tv ADT-1 with the live channels app) i suppose it's a couple seconds to switch and see, but the guide is snappy-fast (except for right after a device restart when it hasn't pulled the guide data yet), and it was way faster than the STB's i had from Comcast back when (which were probably a 6 sec delay plus having a terrible guide).&#x200B;the box in my case has native mpeg2 + avc decoding, so i'm sure that helps. no issues on my internal network for handling the worst case 12-15 mbit streams. "
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","depending on what you need, the hdhr extend will do the hardware transcoding on the tuner-side, which can lower various overheads on your stb/network-end."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?",I have an antenna installed in the ceiling of my garage. But I haven’t been able to run coax inside. It’s the only thing stopping me right now. Is it possible to stream OTA wireless from the garage without running Ethernet or coax inside to my router/TV?
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","Tuning is much faster on HDHR.  I have put apple TVs on all of my TVs, bought the HDHRs I needed (I have 6 total tuners) and setup the Channels app and DVR.  The DVR will be getting tested once fall TV starts up...but we've been using the app exclusively for the summer and it works great.  Also the Channels developers have a forum (like Tablo does) and they are very active on it."
"Thinking of switching from Tablo to HDHomeRun, advice?","HDHRs are great, channel switching is fast too.  Just FYI though, if you get the HDHR Extend (the one that can transcode), the transcode process makes channel switching slow, so make sure to turn transcode off so that you get the straight MPEG2 broadcast."

So I’m a new cord cutter. I bought an LG Smart TV. I want it to turn on directly to YouTube TV app instead of the antenna (which I don’t have at all). I can’t find how to do that. Thanks in advance.,This is totally possible. Rearrange the app icons so it is second in the list. Should be to the right of the live TV icon. When you turn off the TV while YT TV is running the TV should restart the app when turned back on. You may have to turn on the quick start feature.

"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency",Thanks for posting! This is going to be happening a lot over the next few years. 
"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency","I wasn't aware of this. Evidently my local ION station will be changing in November, so thank you!"
"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency","Does this generally affect the reception quality of the stations, or just the frequency they broadcast over?  Does it affect the numbering too?"
"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency","I am not an expert on this subject so I might be wrong, however from my understanding it shouldn't affect the reception quality unless there is some existing interference in the new frequency range. No the channel number shouldn't change. My Station 5.1 was still 5.1 when they switch frequencies. "
"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency","YES reception quality can be affected.  For example if a station moves from VHF to UHF, which is more susceptible to interference, it can be more difficult.   (UHF also has shorter range... 60 miles versus 100 miles for VHF.)  Also some stations are actually moving location..... two of my stations moved 20 miles more distant, so now instead of being rock solid, they often pixelate the image.  (And sometimes can't be seen at all.)"
"FYI 7 TV stations in the Utah, USA area changed frequency",I find it fascinating your Utah stations coordinated the same date.  In my two cities (Harrisburg and Philadelphia) the stations changed frequencies Whenver they felt like it.  Some switched back in 2017.... some in January.... some in the next few months.
splitter for cable input and hd antenna input?,"Get an external tuner box to use for the antenna, connect it via HDMI. Your TV's tuner isn't able to be used for antenna and cable at the same time, you would have to refresh channels every time you switch."

Antenna/cable coax splitter questions -lg smart tv,"Either an A/B switch, and switch between ""Air"" and ""Cable"" on your TV every time you wish to switch sources, or (by far the easiest), is to get an external tuner box such as an iView 3500STBII, plug it into HDMI 1, and run your aerial to the external tuner box.  Do a channel scan with the box, and now you will be dual feeding your television with both cable TV, and your aerial.  All you will need t do to switch to your aerial is to switch to HDMI1 and turn on the box."
Antenna/cable coax splitter questions -lg smart tv,"It doesn't work that way. Your TV expects an antenna or cable over coax, not both. You can buy a separate tuner for the antenna and connect it via HDMI."
Antenna/cable coax splitter questions -lg smart tv,The cable channels are much stronger (amplified) and would overwhelm any OTA signal on a particular channel. That would probably also be the case for the amplified noise in unused cable channels if there are any in your cable system.

"Looking for Antenna Options, plus other OTA questions",Having done this process a few times now I HIGHLY recommend you try bunny ears on top of your TV first.

(The Mohu Leaf is another one to try).If you decide to do a directional antenna I recommend a small yagi antenna. I have a very similar one to this one and it is pretty fantastic:[RCA Antenna](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Compact-Outdoor-Antenna-Range/dp/B0024R4B5C/)You're probably not gonna need an amplifier at all because you're relatively close to the brodcast tower.

Hulu cutting off live sporting events,"Network program guides are driving everything. And that data doesn’t update on the fly. Even our old hardware DVRs could not adapt to modified start and end times due to sports overruns. However, what we COULD do with the hardware box was pad the recordings by adding minutes or hours on the back end. Sadly cloud DVRs aren’t there yet. Multiple Hulu users “recording” the same program are likely accessing a single digital file on Hulu servers. Allowing users the flexibility to customize the end time would increase storage needs exponentially. Instead of a single recording of the 9/8 Braves vs Diamondbacks game on Fox SportsSouth, there would be one recording for the scheduled runtime, another for scheduled +5 min, scheduled +15 min, scheduled +60 min, etc. I believe PS Vue automatically extends sporting events. Seems like I’ve heard people mention a 30 minute automatic extension. Maybe a Vue user can comment. YouTube TV seems to (manually?) modify recordings of major sporting events to include the whole thing. I’ve seen it happen, but don’t record a lot of sports so cannot say how reliable it is. "

Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure," Agreed. I live in Austin and was totally psyched to hear that google fiber was coming. I used to check obsessively on google’s site when the service would be available to my central Austin neighborhood. “Coming soon!” it said. Weeks turned into months and months turned into years, but it never came.  But just yesterday, I signed up for gigabit from a local cable provider.   Well, okay then. I got my gigabit largely in part just because of the *potential* competition of google. So, umm, thanks google!"
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"I actually heard a talk from Verizon's CEO that essentially argued that was the intended design of the program. Google gets paid the more activity to input into their ecosystem. The increase in internet speed results in more potential searches/views per second, which has a direct impact on their profitability. The idea for Google Fiber was to start putting pressure on ISPs to increase their base service speeds by generation PR about the minor amount of work they were doing to rival the lazy business models of ISPs. ISPs respond by increasing speed. Mission accomplished.  "
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"I lived in a neighborhood that was slated for the second phase of GF in Austin. They sent me an email stating it would be installed in three months. Two months later, I had a lot going on, and wasn’t going to be watching much TV, so cancelled the service I had (ATT). Plan was to get that sweet GF hooked up the following month. Long story short, I went a year without TV and home internet. Spent more time out of the house, and didn’t miss a thing. Saw some great bands, learned to two step, went on a lot of dates, and ended up meeting a great girl that I’m now engaged to. GF eventually came, and I enjoyed about three months of it at that place before moving out. The Fiancé and I live in a GF house. It’s fine, but I did have gigabit from another provider in there, and it was just as good. GF is great, but it’s not the best thing ever. There are alternatives. They’re creating competition, at least in parts of Austin. I think their biggest challenge is dealing with red tape put in place by the other telecoms already in the area. "

Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"Texas markets (and two other states I believe) for Verizon FiOS were sold to Frontier around 2 years ago.They are an awful company, from customer service to the line running to your house, they will find a way to screw it up."
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"Its unlikely its the same infrastructure as the backbones would have been changed since 2005. Also Frontier came in, so that's why its bad. "
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"> But what if the company’s goal was never to unleash the disrupter itself so much as to encourage incumbent broadband providers to do so,I interviewed with Google Fiber when they were first starting out.  I was straight up told *exactly* this.  They had every intention of trying to turn a profit, but would consider the whole venture a success if it simply forced incumbent ISPs to start offering Gigabit Internet service at competitive prices.Kudos to them, I just wish they would expand into my market."
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,i'm of the opinion that google fiber was a scheme from the get-go to basically scare and force the incumbent big providers to massively ramp up and get gigabit services deployed to large segments of their network and user base - and let them absorb the cost of doing so. google IMHO never intended to go very far with google fiber.

Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"Suddenlink wanted to charge me $89/month for 50Mb down .I told them to get fucked. Then they offered me $59/month (introductory) for 50Mb down, which is the fastest option in my area. I said OK fine. That was 6 weeks ago. I still don't have internet, and the earliest I can expect to be hooked up is still 3 weeks away. I miss google"
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,It wasn't a failure here in Charlotte.   AT&T Fiber pulled cable down my street a couple of years ago.  I don't think they would have done so without Google doing the same here.

Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"Anybody else have Cox? Google Fiber worked kinda for Cox, but also taught the exact wrong less. I can get Gigablast, which is a gig down. But it's only 35 up with a 1TB cap. If the whole point of Fiber was to get people to use more data faster, any cap goes exactly against that point, and 35 up against 1000 down is insanity. "
Why Google Fiber Is High-Speed Internet’s Most Successful Failure,"Something must be wrong, gigablast is supposed to be symmetrical. I pay more than I want to but i've got a connection that will easily speed test into the 7-800s on ethernet.

new tv shopping Q,sorry for the confusion.. I guess my point is my wifi sometimes becomes sluggish when I'm watching TV and periodically the HD quality will go up and down.. and since I've made the choice to quit Directv and stream my TV (which I'm fine with these issues)... it makes me wonder when buying a new TV if I will really tell the difference between the TCL and a TV twice as much when my streaming isn't consistent.
new tv shopping Q,^^ this

new tv shopping Q,Believe it or not I have a 55” plasma TV set up with a chromecast and we have YouTube TV & Netflix in our living room that works just fine. We do have a samsung smart tv in our bedroom (smaller) same setup and the only difference that we can tell is the smart tv has better picture quality. Let us know what you end up doing. We weren’t going to get a new tv to replace our 55” till it died but are thinking maybe we should to get better picture quality. 
Optimum putting the screws to me,Any reason why you need 300/30?You can get optimum 100 for $50/month if you tell them you can get verizon for $40 [here](https://www.verizon.com/home/MLP/OnlineVZ.html?x1=INTPH_COMPARE&promotion_code=JUNCT/W04)They will be willing to bargain after you cancel tv and phone.Call every year to get the discount if it goes up.If you want to keep your phone you can transfer it to google voice with [this guide](https://www.obitalk.com/info/tutorials/porttutorial)For tv you can go with over the air or sling
Optimum putting the screws to me,Exactly what I did. My 100 for $50 promo ends this month actually. Hopefully they'll do it again.
Optimum putting the screws to me,"Sometimes lower tiers have lower upload speed. Comcast for example has 60/5 and then 150/10 (for $15 more). For those of that WFH, that extra 5mbps upload really helps."
Optimum putting the screws to me,You don’t watch cable but pay for it out of habit??!
Optimum putting the screws to me,"I'd return all the tv and phone equipment to their store and cancel them, then negotiate for internet only price later over the phone, unless they're willing to do so at the store.... . You'll have more leverage that way. If you mention Fios $40 dollar internet, they'll usually give you the promo price. I'm on the optimum 100 for about $50 per month. Be polite and pleasant but firm. Know their competitors promos in your area and keep your receipts from your returns."
Optimum putting the screws to me,"So you're saying that it'll save you $2 to cancel TV and phone? Sounds like bullshit to me. Check their website for accurate rates instead of some rep trying to keep you from canceling. Personally, I'd cancel everything and go to another company. Comcast is a bunch of dicks, too, but fuck any company that wants to charge $120 just for internet access."
Optimum putting the screws to me,"Not to defend Comcast but when I busted my $225+/mo package down to $49.95/mo internet only a year and a half ago my bill hasn't budged one penny. I had my own modem & router anyway. But I'm honestly waiting for what their arm twisting ultimatum to squeeze me for more money will be.  Edit. btw what prompted me to drop them was similar to what happened to you. ""Hardware upgrade no charge!!""  Got & installed it. None of my premium channels would show up unless I ""upgraded"" my package which was ""incompatible"" with the new hardware and, of course, more expensive. That's when I took everything back and busted it down to internet only. Con artists. "
Optimum putting the screws to me,"I have had similar issues with Verizon before. I generally like them and my only other option is Comcast and that is never happening again. Verizon tried to do the same situation and in doing so they would lock me into a 2 yr contract when I didn’t want one. I firmly told them that we would never hook a phone up and only would settle for the lowest cable package and my current internet speeds. Got them to agree and all was good for a little while until the started offering gigabit in my area. Only way to get gigabit was to cancel my service, claim I was moving to a non serviced area and opening a new account as the “new” home owner. Bill went for $120 a month to $90 and I have the same basic tv package, internet only would have been $100 a month which is bs, and 940 mbps. "
Optimum putting the screws to me,effect
Optimum putting the screws to me,"I was paying Optimum $130/month for 300/30 internet and a TV promo rate that included HBO and Showtime, etc.I wasn’t watching TV so I figured I’d cancel cable and prepare to downgrade to the 200 plan for $85/month. When I called to cancel, they told me the 300 plan alone was something crazy like $120/month but before I countered, they offered to let me keep the 300 plan as long as I agreed to receive the broadcast basic channels via the Optimum app for $75/month for one year. It was a good offer and I took it."
Optimum putting the screws to me,Thank you to everyone who chimed in.  I guess the lesson is to call back and negotiate until someone is willing to give me a decent deal.  
Optimum putting the screws to me,">  I called but was told they couldn’t tell me what the new promotion was until it was in affect. It went into affect yesterday and of course it is $20 more.How is it even legal to switch customers to a different plan w/o the customer agreeing?  That's ridiculous!  (As for my internet, I use DSL at $30/month.)"

Switchoff: Swiss to ditch digital terrestrial TV becoming 1st European country to do,so no more over the air television? that sucks. that doesn't change the fact that its not worth paying to be brainwashed. if that's what it came down to then i'd have to go without. not only is paid tv service too expensive but television was set up to be free as far not paying for it with your money. you pay for it by being subjected to commercials and social engineering. i hope that never happens in the u.s. because not only is high speed internet not available everywhere but not everyone can afford internet. As for the U.S. - sales of antennas are increasing.  http://m.startribune.com/antenna-sales-are-rising-in-another-sign-of-churn-in-tv-watching/491230121/

Best Streaming for Local Channels?,I have a Tablo OTA DVR to record my local channels since none of the streaming services carry the CW in my area. DTVN is the only one I know of other than Sling that carries The Weather channel but they may not have NBC live in your area. I recommend doing a free trial of DTVN and comparing it. 
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,"Well not sure what market you are in, but most services have the “on demand” version of a broadcast channel if they don’t carry it live.  I’m fortunate in that PS Vue, YTTV, Hulu Live and DTVN all carry the 4 major locals in my market (Dallas) so I went with Vue since it had NFL Redzone.  I know that as least with Vue sometimes the Fox “national” feed is carried with markets where they don’t have local feeds."
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,DTVN has NBC On Demand and the Weather Channel. 
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,DTVN has NBC live available in some markets so OP would either have to do a free trial or check their website to see what locals are live in their area through DTVN. 
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,You could get the air tv box if you like sling and use an antenna which integrates locals into the sling app. Pending you get decent reception that way. That’s how I get my locals for my directv now sub using a tablo box. 
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,"Youtube tv has live locals (cvs,abc,nbc,fox) some not available in all areas so run a free trial. There's no weather channel but if you have a roku, they have the ""local now"" channel from TWC which is pretty much their local on the 8s."
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,"depends entirely on where you live. Not every streaming service offers local channels in every market, and even if they do, they may not have every local channel.imo, try all of the streaming services, since they all have trial periods to find the one for you.Remember the cancel during the trial period if you're not interested in keeping the service."
Best Streaming for Local Channels?,Have you tried YouTube TV or PlayStation Vue?
Attic installation and selection,"Nobody can give you a good recommendation on installing in an attic.  The way it's constructed can really affect the signal and if you live in a snow area, snow on the roof will affect it too.  If you were installing outside, I'd say a Winegard HD7694P or a Channel Master CM 2016 would work really well for you.   You can put it in the attic but no guarantees on how well it works.  With that said, the Mohu is a pretty bad antenna.  Almost anything is going to work better than it.  "

Bought a house with this monster,Dude.  This is the funniest comment in a long time.
Bought a house with this monster,It cracks me the hell up that people are now coveting these when it was considered a huge win when everyone was getting rid of them 15-20 years ago. It's really hilarious!
Bought a house with this monster,"Digital FTW. Cable TV usually kicked the butt of analog OTA.  No ghosting, no noise.OTA digital, on the other hand, is cleaner and has a better picture, usually (and never worse) than digital HD cable."
Bought a house with this monster,"You ain't lying! When I was growing up in the 90s if your house had one of these...you probably didn't get cable, and would be judged. I remember my grandma being proud she had one and then tearing it down as you didn't need it anyone with cable. In 2018 there's folks who DREAM of these and now gleefully install antennas in their attic or outside. It's so funny that in my house I have two antennas that are the flat type and nobody cares. Just a decade ago it'd been jokes...."
Bought a house with this monster,15 to 20 years ago you couldn't stream TV and their wasn't HD TV. Cable was the thing.
Bought a house with this monster,"yeah came in to say the same, funny how that works"
Bought a house with this monster,"Probably a bit longer ago than that in many places. I grew up when cable, HBO, and later MTV were just coming out. I don't remember any of the houses we lived in having a roof antenna. We just used the rabbit ears and loops that came with the TV. This may have been part of what made cable so popular. If you had just had a proper outdoor antenna setup, 80% of the ghosting and static would be gone. I don't think most people cared because, even though you would cuss when the picture flaked out, the sound was more stable and still synchronized. So a shitty analog antenna will work better than a shitty antenna in the digital TV age."
Bought a house with this monster,I never bought into the hype that it was cool to pay for television channels or that those tall towers were unsightly while those dishes looked sheek. 
Bought a house with this monster,Any chance I can still use it? Any advice?
Bought a house with this monster,"That thing is awesome!  Just check the tower braces for rust to verify they won't break if you need to go up it.  Also check the coax tables coming from the antenna and verify they're in good order.  I've found that some older antennas oxidize, if you see lots of green on the antenna it may be worth carefully cleaning the antenna elements.  But over all this looks like a nice setup!  Is there an antenna rotor on it?  If so bonus?  Also are those 30"" Dishes?  If so then you're also setup for FTA television, super bonus!  I've wanted to setup something like this at my place for years, but the XYL would heavily object :-D"
Bought a house with this monster,"If it's in good shape that is an awesome asset to have! Radio from around the world, TV, shit you could probably do ham radio.Set up a weather station, 360 degree webcam, etc.Fun stuff."
Bought a house with this monster,"Please, have it inspected before you climb it, by someone who knows something about towers.  Even better, pay a professional to do the work.  Local ham radio operators might be able to help you find the right person for the job.That being said, the antenna doesn't look 100%, it may be able to be used or fixed, but getting a new one that will last is a good idea too, you don't want to go up the tower more than you have to (or pay someone more than you have to).Get some good coax and be sure the connectors are done correctly for the outdoors.  Some Times Microwave LMR 400 or similar (75 ohm) would be ideal.  Yes, I know its $1.50 a foot but it is worth it (the lesser the coax, the more signal is lost between the antenna and the TV).Check out the rotator, if it works and looks good, it should be OK, if there seems to be anything suspect, just replace it, if it doesn't rotate at a constant speed, doesn't seem to stay on its heading, or if it looks like there is any water penetration, for example.  The idea is that you work on it once, and it will last a good 30 years.Interesting note, back when the digital TV switch happened, my local ham radio club volunteered to help a lot of low income elderly people make the switch.  We had a benefactor that also helped us upgrade many of their antenna systems, coax, rotators, etc.  My suggestions are basically what we did for many of these folks.  It has been about a decade, and we haven't had to return to any of these houses to fix anything.  Our community is on the fringe of three tv markets with really no local channels, so, rabbit ears and 30 year old cheap RG59 or twinlead just wasn't going to cut it.  Anyway, it was a super fun way to serve the community.  "

Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,Depends if it is designed to work with only 0.5 amps or 1+. If its made to work with more than 0.5 then you are limiting it by using the TV port.
Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,"> then you are limiting it by using the TV portEven that depends.The USB ports on a lot of TVs from the past couple years are starting to supply 1 amp, sometimes even more. I've seen a couple with the current labeled next to the port. I've also seen it listed in the manual on occasion."
Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,TV preamps use very little power. So in theory it should make no difference.
Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,I'd say it's worth trying.Keep in mind that is also possible to will get better reception without the amplifier.
Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,"I switched from the 5W USB adapter to a 12W USB adapter on my Mohu Leaf 50 and it seems to make a difference. Before, the signal would cut out on certain channels. Now I don’t see any hiccups like that."
Better reception if I plug amplifier into wall rather than tv USB?,Possibly if it needs more juice than tv can supply. Try it. 
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"I have long proposed doing this but my wife can’t seem to let go of pay TV.  I usually use Amazon to buy shows but AFIAK just buy on whatever service works best for you.  Amazon is pretty reliable and has season pass options.   Vudu works fine too.  Stay away from FandangoNow as they tend to have capacity issues at peak times.  And I don’t buy on iTunes because you have to watch on Apple devices only.  Google play may work for you?But again, I’ve always just used Amazon (except the rare occasion to try another service.)  You can play their stuff in almost any device or get Roku or Amazon devices cheap."
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"Thanks. It sounds like your experience confirms what I’ve currently researched. I really would like to go with iTunes Store since I’m already in that ecosystem, but lack of device support kills it for me. That leaves the choice between Amazon and Vudu. "
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"> my wife can’t seem to let go of pay TV. Don't give her an option.  Just cancel it and then say, ""Well if you want it back, then YOU can pay the monthly bill.  I'm done wasting ~2000 dollars each year."""
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,I've never had a problem with either Amazon or Vudu.   Sometimes one has a better price over the other.  
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,I've had good luck with Amazon as well.
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"Do a fair amount of research before you jump in and start buying. I have a fairly significant TV library in iTunes that I started building 8-10 years ago. I don’t really regret it, but there are so many streaming options these days that it’s probably cheaper to pay one or two monthly fees with access to a larger library. You mention Netflix but Hulu and Amazon Prime are also options. Philo is a “live TV” streaming service with about 40 non-sports channels for only $16 per month. It has VOD and DVR features built-in. With channels like Nick, HGTV, Food network and TLC, you have a huge library of kids programming and reality to tap into just by adding shows to the cloud DVR. Soon Disney is supposed to be launching its own streaming service if you’re looking for Disney Channel type stuff. You could subscribe to a couple different services—say Hulu and Philo—for less than the cost of purchasing a single season of one show. If you get bored with one service, drop it and spend the money on something else. There are benefits to owning shows and knowing they’ll be available at any time. After all, things can disappear off Hulu, etc. But if you really go all-in with buying, you’ll likely spend hundreds of dollars on shows you watch once then never again. "
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"I've found that if buying not the latest season, used DVDs can be much cheaper than buying streaming access. And they have the added benefit of including bonus features. Of course, the downside is having to walk across the room every 2 hours to change the disc. Also Netflix by mail can be pretty economical if you have the discipline to watch and return right away, and are unlikely to want to watch that series again "
Cord cutting this week. Best place to buy shows by the season?,"I'd do a little research for each show. For example, the entire show might be on Hulu. Just subscribe for a couple months and then cancel- it could be cheaper than outright buying it. "
Best HDMI External Tuner for Picture Quality?,"Easiest solution out there would be to get a Tivo Roamio.   Plug it in, and it will handle all your channels, give you a two week guide, and integrate streaming apps, and has an excellent remote control.   Of course it's a DVR too.'Downside, it's going to cost some.  You either have to pay a monthly sub, or buy a lifetime subscription.  Anything else is going to be a compromise in ease vs cost vs picture quality."

Best HDMI External Tuner for Picture Quality?,"While it's nice that it can scale up to 2160p, doesn't any 4K TV already do that?Is there any definitive accounts from reviewers that the scaler built into the Channel Master Stream+ is better than the one that TVs use?"
Best HDMI External Tuner for Picture Quality?,"Hdhomerun you can get a Connect for under $50.00.  I know you didn't want a Network tuner, but it gives you uncompressed mpeg2 and from what I read a better video quality than a Tablo."

"Antenna experience with smart TVs Roku, Vizio, LG, others.",Just bought a new Samsung last week. It has the guides and looks great in HD. Took my Roku out. The app on the TV works better. 
"Antenna experience with smart TVs Roku, Vizio, LG, others.","Double check whether the Vizio TV you're buying even has a TV tuner in it. Vizio removed to tuners from their TVs a few years ago as a cost cutting measure.They only added them back in with the 2018 models.So, if you're buying a discounted 2016 or 2017 model for some reason, just be aware that it probably won't have a tuner built in."

NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,This silly story keeps spreading as if somebody wants to watch football on a phone. Am I living in a bubble here. Are there people actually watching games on mobile except when stuck at a social function or restaurant as a desperation solution.It hardly has anything to do with cordcutting.
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,Monday night football and Thursday night football are excellent for watching on your phone.  Perfect for being able to cruise on your commute and listen to the game. 
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"I watched Thursday night's game on the NBCSports app and it was terrible. The app crashed at least 5 times while I was streaming the game through my chromecast. The NFL really needs to step it up. I'm willing to pay for the NFL games that arent locally televised but unfortunately DirecTV owns the exclusive rights to out-of-market games (which is ridiculous on the face of it) and you either have to get their satellite service to get it, or live in a place where you cant get satellite service. They started letting people get Sunday Ticket with DirecTV Now, but only for a select handful of markets which also makes no sense. If the NFL wants to get all the cord-cutters back, let Sling or Hulu or somebody other than DirecTV sell out-of-market games to streaming customers. "
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"Or let Sling play any games. I am in Utah and Thursday and all Sunday / Monday games are blacked out for my area. Even though Sling advertising pushes NFL games. So I'm not sure who I should be mad at...the NFL or Sling, but one of them can fuck right off."
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"This will be my first season since cutting the chord, but it looks like the following will be available:Thursday Night FootballSunday Night FootballMonday Night FootballGames shown in your local market (or just your local team?)All available through an NFL app? Am I understanding correctly?"
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,Correct it will be free on the NFL App as well as Yahoo Sports App. The Thursday Night games will also be on Twitch and Amazon Prime TV.
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"You are slightly mistaken.The only thing ""new"" here is that streaming NFL games on a mobile phone is now available to customers of all carriers. In prior years, if you wanted to stream an NFL game on a phone, you had to have Verizon Wireless. Any service that streamed games online (such as WatchESPN, Fox Sports Go, CBS All Access or NFL Network) would prevent you from watching the stream if you used the smartphone version of their app. The only way to watch would be through the NFL Mobile app which would check if you were on Verizon first.With this move, those services will be able to stream to mobile devices regardless of cellular carrier. But you still have to have access to those services, which in most cases means you need a cable TV login.* For your local Fox games, you will need a cable TV login for Fox Sports Go.* For your local CBS game, you will need CBS All Access.* Sunday Night Football on NBC is available without a cable TV login. You must be physically located within the United States.* For Monday Night Football, you will need a cable TV login for WatchESPN (unless your local team is playing, in which case it'll be available on the NFL Mobile app.)* For Thursday Night Football, you will need Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, or a cable TV login for Fox Sports Go or NFL Network (unless your local team is playing, in which case it'll be available on the NFL Mobile app.)"
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,">free, mobile streaming access to local CBS and Fox Sunday afternoon games as well as NBC’s Sunday Night Football and ESPN’s Monday Night Football gamesSo you can watch all that live via the mobile Yahoo Sports app if you're in market.Fox Thursday Nights are streamed via Amazon Prime.If you're willing to pay money, NFL Game Pass gets you out of market games. And then there are the OTT streaming cable services like YouTube TV, PlayStation Vue, etc that you can subscribe to to get access to things like ESPN, NFL Network, etc and maybe some local CBS/Fox/NBC stations depending on where you live."
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"It's been better outside the US for a long time.  International Gamepass has been showing nearly all games for a few years.  Now I get them all (including Red Zone channel) from DAZN, which only costs $150 a year.  "
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"I would be happy to legit pay for the international game pass package (in the us). I enjoyed game pass the one year it was available if you bought a copy of Madden. I would’ve happily continued to subscribe, but I’m not signing up for direct tv if all I want is 16 weeks of programming. That’s absurd. I feel like the NFL is making a huge financial mistake if you weigh what they get from the direct tv deal vs directly selling to out of market fans who just want to see their team play during the regular season. "
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"Sorry moved on, it's really a back up entertainment option if it happens to be on. I no longer plan the weekend around watching the NFL. MLB tried pulling all this blackout junk as well so I moved on there as well. "
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"Ya, my grandmother always used to go grocery shopping on Sunday afternoon. Was always jealous of her foresight."
NFL Looks to Score With Cord-Cutters,"Sports are so easy to stream for free, there are few gambling sites that stream all the sporting events from around the world, I guess they are trying to get you to gamble on them."

Help with Rabbit Ear Antenna,"You are not line of sight to any of the transmitters as indicated by the ""1Edge"" on your TVFool report.  This means there's something in the way (building, hill, water tower, or something like these). That also affects what rabbit ear type antennas can receive.  The 2 channels you have no luck receiving are both VHF channels, where the rest are UHF. UHF bounces around and off of things nicely where VHF does not.  Best advice I can give you is to get something outside if you can (which will eliminate a couple of bounce points and signal attenuation). An amplified antenna may also help."
Help with Rabbit Ear Antenna,"Rabbit ears are VHF antennas designed to receive VHF channels.  Also you said ""UHF bounces nicely"" but not true.  Shortwaves degrade much faster than longwaves.  (Which is why even in ideal conditions UHF is only receivable to 60 miles, while VHF can be received upto 100 miles.)I'm an electrical engineer who was forced to study this crap in college."
Help with Rabbit Ear Antenna,"Your house might be made out out of materials that block TV signals and your antenna is likely too low to the ground. Your problem channels are VHF band which are received on the ""ear"" elements. You might try adjusting them. There is some stuff about adjusting rabbit ears here:* http://www.hdtvprimer.com/ANTENNAS/RabbitEars.html"
Help with Rabbit Ear Antenna,ABC and CBS in your area are both in the VHF band.  Is the antenna you purchased rated for VHF?  A half wave dipole antenna for these channels would be about 3 ft across.

Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,That’s a creative choice. Not all films work the best shooting in 16x9. I have a few films I’ve shot that are on Netflix. They do not require a certain aspect ratios
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"Firstly 16:9 is not the ideal aspect ratio for many styles of film. Secondly and much more importantly, many films are filmed backed by other companies and are later sold to Netflix for distribution "
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"I'm curious what the ""ideal aspect ratio"" is?   I've seen a wide range of aspect ratios over the years, but nobody has determined what ratio would be ""ideal"""
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"A lot of Netflix movies are just movies that Netflix bought the rights to distribute. They aren't all made specifically for Netflix, but were made for cinemas. "
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"That makes a lot of sense, thanks for the explanation."
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"All of the people who have posted so far are giving you the wrong answer.The real reason is that a lot of Netflix shows are shot on Arri or Red cameras. The native aspect ratio of these cameras is 2:1, not 16:9 or 2.4:1.Netflix and the creators of these shows have chosen to to crop off the edges of what the camera is capturing just to make the image perfectly fit a 16:9 screen.That is why you see very slim black bars on the top of bottom of Strangers Things, The Crown, etc. Edit: I am just talking about Netflix original content. I am not talking about movies that produced by someone else in cinema 2.4:1 and Netflix later purchased their streaming rights."
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"Ah, that explains the narrow bars on Hulu's new shows too. I thought they were shooting in 18:9 because they get a lot of mobile views and w/ newer phones being 18:9 now. "
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,Yeah I have a Netflix setting on my projector for this reason. 
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"It’s not a movie, but “Godless” is 2.35:1. (And it’s great!)"
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,"Why are 95% of Netflix original shows shot at all? That's the real question (since they're awful). It'd be different if even 10% of them were as good as Stranger Things, Lost in Space, Altered Carbon, and The End of the F*cking World."
Why are Netflix movies not shot in 16:9?,Why do you think everybody has the same taste as you. Netflix is making shows for wide varieties of people. Just because you don't think something doesn't mean other people don't think it is good.

Sorry, I have nothing further to help you."

'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Not sure how I feel. Had enormous potential and it was wasted 
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"Maybe Netflix will steer it in a better direction.  I was a big fan of season 1, but feel they sort of squandered season 2."
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I wanted to like this show when it first aired. Cool premise and good actors. But after 7 episodes I gave up. The writing became hackneyed and characters behaved totally unlike what would (or should) happen in real life.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,First season was waaaaay too preachy with the morals. I couldn’t get past a few episodes and dumped it. Can’t believe it’s still going.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"This show was (unfortunately) terrible. Watched the first 1.25 seasons. One of the only shows I’ve ever quit.The first season was somewhat 24-esque. Then in the beginning of the second season, they killed off everyone related to the bombing plot and it just turned it into a low-rate wannabe West Wing. Not what I signed up for.I feel like they intentionally mislead the audience. They wanted to make a political drama, but they needed a way to draw people in."
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"Lately, it seems Netflix is more focused on quantity than quality."
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Hulu has had the prior seasons so I suspect they will be leaving Hulu soon if they haven't already.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"They've confirmed that Seasons 1 & 2 will be moving to Netflix ""this Fall"". Whenever that will be. Apparently they negotiated with Hulu to get them. No details on the specifics of that though."
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Netflix has the streaming rights in the UK already. 
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I don’t know about that. They got the rights less than a year ago and these stream deals last a good while. The only way it leaves Hulu is if Netflix paid them enough for them to be ok with parting from it.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"I think if it's on Netflix I will continue to watch, I trust them to do better. I did watch the previous seasons and only really cared for the first, it was good, but the second wasn't really, I just watched it to fill my time."

'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"Live viewership was low, but timeshifted viewership (DVR/VOD) was apparently high. That's why ABC cancelled it, being primarily a live network means that it was a bad fit for them."
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I did.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I think I watched all of season one despite increasingly losing interest in it.  I didn't even bother with Season 2.  I'm surprised it has enough viewers for the show to even be saved.  Did it suddenly get better in S2 to make it interesting?  IDK.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Wife and I watch it all the time.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I watched it because I enjoyed how terrible it was
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,I enjoyed it cause nothing else was on at that time but it was certainly a very dumb show

I watched the first season in its entirety.  Once they got too convoluted with the conspiracy, it got to be a bit of a chore.  I recorded the second season, but deleted it about a month ago without watching it.  "
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"Ehh.. It was ok, but to be honest i wouldn't miss it being gone. All these revivals and spin off's of old shows is really gaining a trend. Bring back breaking bad as a Jessie Pinkman spinoff!"

'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"I love how all these Network shows are getting renewed by Netflix. Can’t wait to see them all infused with nudity, uktraviolonce, maximum profanity, and all manner of sex scenes. No more content restrictions doesn’t always mean better TV but given where Network TV has to start from it’ll almost certainly mean better TV here. "
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"I have high hopes. Netflix wrapped up ""the killing"" decently enough "
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Hopefully not filmed for tv. I hate obvious commercial cuts. You can see them even after they are removed. It’s all about the timing.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Netflix needed more Canadian content and as both Kieffer Sutherland and the show were produced in Canada Netflix killed two birds with one show.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,Season 1 ++ Season 2 - - Season 3 Dont care anymore 
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,4 showrunners in 2 seasons killed any kind of flow that the storyline had.Hopefully Netflix gives it 1 GOOD one. I enjoyed season 1. Season 2 was awful.
'Designated Survivor' Revived at Netflix for a Third Season,"I thought DS was a very good season.  Unfortunately, it lasted two seasons.  Like 24 and Prison Break, it went on longer than it should have."

Maddow,"You can see the Rachel Maddow show (which I assume is what you mean by Maddow?) on Pluto.tv channel 110.  It's not just a live stream of the MSNBC channel; it's programming from NBC News and MSNBC shown with some delay.  But it is free, so better than nothing."
Maddow,The NBC News App (for Roku and Apple TV 4th gen) has her show sometimes as soon as 2 hours after airing. 
Maddow,"Yep. This is what I use. They break her show (as well as other popular MSNBC shows) up into long clips but usually post the entire show as 4 or 5 clips. And no ads! Only downside is that the show isn't usually available until 11 PM Eastern or later, it seems. (But you can always watch it the next day.)"
Maddow,You can watch the first part of the show for free (with no commercials) on Apple Podcast (also has ATV app)
Maddow,"Not free but Vue, YouTube TV, and other cable replacement services carry msnbc."

Indoor antenna recommendation?,"What material are your basement walls made of?I've never been able to get a proper signal from any indoor antenna underground, regardless of cost. "
Indoor antenna recommendation?,"If it's basement then most likely cinder block and that shit is a signal killer. If OP has no way of putting on in the attic then I think he's kind of hosed.My antenna is actually just coat hangers on a 2x4.

Indoor antenna recommendation?,The house is a 1950's ranch with stucco so it's basically wood + bricks + stucco.  I actually get a handful of channels just not the ones I want &#x200B;[https://imgur.com/a/rO11Fek](https://imgur.com/a/rO11Fek) <- List of channels currently picked up.&#x200B;
Indoor antenna recommendation?,Try to get the antenna away from any potential sources of interference. The HDHR and network cable could be such sources.
Indoor antenna recommendation?,"I had a similar issue in our old house.  We had an indoor antenna in our basement that was very hit or miss.If it's feasible, I would install an outdoor antenna and run the coax into the basement.  The top of the basement is just above ground, so you should be able to drill in through that joist (make sure to seal it with silicone) and run your coaxial cable from outside into the basement, where it can connect to your HDHomeRun."
Indoor antenna recommendation?,I was worried it would come to that. The spousal acceptance factor is quite important so I'll have to be careful before drilling anything......
Indoor antenna recommendation?,"If your antenna is in the basement, then looks probably don't matter.  Get yourself a CM4228, prop it against a chair (or mount on a coat stand), and every one of your stations will give you 5 bars.  You might even get new stations you never had before.  This is what I use in my apartment.Another antenna that works well is the Winegard Freevision or outdoor-version of the Flatwave "
Confusion about why I can't get a certain channel,"Any obstructions? It says ""1Edge"", which means you don't have direct line of sight to the transmitter, so basically you're relying on the signal to bounce off something to get to you."

Confusion about why I can't get a certain channel,"You have NOTHING line of sight. Something is in the way between you and every TV station you're trying to get.

NFL RedZone/streaming dilemma,"YouTube TV upconverts its channels 1080p. No current cable channel broadcasts in 1080p. Your TV will do the same thing. ESPN (all channels), FS1/2, MLB Network, and all of the FSN channels broadcast in 720p. NFL Network, NHL, and NBA all broadcast in 1080i."

I would be raising hell.I'm not a pro, but I'd assume that ~~if you downgrade and your speed goes down even further, that suggests it's not a technical issue~~. Either way, if they claim that they can only provide you with 30 for whatever reason, then you should only pay for 30.EDIT: On second thought, I'm not sure that it would suggest that. Still ain't right. You deserve what you pay for."

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","For me there was a huge long term difference in the pricing where we were paying around $160 a month for cable tv / internet to now where we're at $110 and we upgraded our Internet from 50 megs to 500 and we have even more to watch now but... and this was a big but... The taxes and the Lease.  We had to 'lease' our equipment previously and we had to pay taxes for all of this crap upwards of $20 a month + $16 lease fee for 2 rooms compared to now where I pay tax on my Internet and that's it.&#x200B;Short term, it seems like a minor saving but over the years, it's a huge saving.&#x200B;"
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",I just can't wrap my head around paying for live tv and the ads that come with it. You don't even have to give it up completely with an antenna. 
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","You could look into switching to cablecard (spectrum charged me like $2/mo for it) + tivo + 3x tivo extender.  Pretty sure the extender doesn't need a monthly plan, and the tivo itself you can price monthly or up front."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Yeah. I really just want two pay channels for streaming, but I have no choice (yet) except to buy a $35 package to get them. So I don't."

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","$90 for an antenna!!!?? I bought an antenna for under $20 and it works great.  Also, he's saying added costs for Netflix.  When I used Comcast, I also had a Netflix subscription and a separate HBO (because fuck Comcast and I wasn't giving them anymore money) so those are costs I never figured in.  But for the argument sake, even if I included Netflix and HBO as added costs, I'm still saving over $100.  I was paying Comcast $250 a month for internet, cable and a phone I NEVER used.  Now I pay $60 for internet, $65 for Vue.  If I add in HBO and Netflix that only brings me up to $150.  That's still $100 less. You can't just say you're quitting cable and not do the research and figure out what works best.  But to say that people aren't saving money is ridiculous."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",[deleted]
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","You certainly can save money by cutting the cord, but when you add up the total costs--yes, including internet, it's almost the same. My math: Frontier Communications charges $110 monthly for TV and Internet, and $35 of that is internet. If I canceled TV, internet goes to $70. If I wanted to get a cable alternative service to replace the TV channels, like YouTube TV, that's $40--bringing me to $110 monthly. I could easily live without the cable alternative, but the wife loves her cable channels. "
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",He made it seem like you have to buy a new antenna every month. What?
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",Breaking news! You can save money by no longer paying for something! 
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",Lets see I went from paying about 150 a month for directv (3 recievers and HBO) to paying 30 on month for Hulu/HBO.  So I've saved about 1400 in the last year and I am no longer forced to deal with commercials.  
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",">For me, I pay $110 monthly for cable and internet. If I ditched TV service, per Frontier Communications, my bill goes down to $70. To pick up the missing entertainment, it’s either $90 for an antenna, or $40 plus for a cable alternative service like YouTube TV or PlayStation VUE.I like how he says its 90$ for an antenna like its more expensive.    Like HOLY COW 90$ a month for an antenna.  No its a 1 time upfront cost, it will cost you more for that first month but you save after the 2nd month.I have a TiVo dvr, cost me $400  sure the first year im not saving any money, but every year after that I save a bundle.  Which is why you have to have 2 year contracts often when you get new equipment.   The first year you have to pay them back for your equipment, after that they are making all profit off you."

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","I had some start up costs as well. $400 tivo w/lifetime sub, $100 firetv, and antennas and coax for a total price of about $550. I was money ahead 7 months in and now 13 months later I'm rolling in the savings and have started buying bds so that I also have movies to watch, which is something I missed because back when I had Dish I'd dvr movies and had a few hundred recorded."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",Used to be a little over 160 a month now down to 54 a month. Damn straight I’m saving money. Will never go back. 
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","The main flaw in the article is the concept that because some of the shows you want to watch are spread across netflix, hulu, hbo, and lets say sling, that you must pay for all 4 every month.  I ditched netflix early this year because my watch list was a pile of mediocrity, and only now am I getting the urge to resubscribe for more than just one or two shows."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","That's the main flaw in the entire argument of ""cutting the cord"".  The reality most people that save money are the ones that realize they simply don't need half of the content they currently get."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",I'm using youtube tv for $40/month and it has almost everything I watch. So I save roughly $85/month over using cable/satellite. I'm about $45/month cheaper than my cable provider's promo bundle deal after bs fees and taxes.My tv watching habits have changed. I used to watch tons of scripted stuff on TV. Now I just watch what's on prime/hbo/netflix. My streaming service is only for sports and the few dwindling shows that still are running that I watched before.yttv paired with my tivo ota roamio I'm pretty much set.

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","This guy . . > For me, I pay $110 monthly for cable and internet. If I ditched TV service, per Frontier Communications, my bill goes down to $70.Okay, that's actually not half bad.  Apples-to-apples, if Internet by itself is $70, getting Frontier's cable is only $40 more, which compares favorably to a lot of streaming service options out there.But is that $110 *really* $110 out-the-door, or is it ""$110"" by the cable company's telling which doesn't include the DVR fee, DVR service fee, cable box fee, regional sports fee, broadcast fee, regulatory recovery fee, CEO yacht fee and sales tax so that the actual bill is north of $200?And is that $110 a promotional rate that expires in a year and quietly doubles afterwards?  Is there a contract?  Can they raise the rate at any time during the contract?But let's say it's really, honest-to-goodness $110/mo.  A lot of cord cutters don't want linear TV *at all.*  So there's no need for a streaming live-TV alternative.  That $40 savings can go right into my pocket."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","I'm with you on not trusting the pricing on the cable company, but I also believe Netflix, YouTube TV etc. will all be raising their prices in the coming years as well.

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Yes, you technically *can* save money but add together a few of these standalone streaming services and the cost of internet access and you're right back to paying almost as much as you were for cable, if not more and we are right back to the overpriced cable bundles we all tried to escape."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",Exactly&#x200B;Jefferson GrahamUSA TODAY
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Thats why you pick and choose.- Do you need Netflix or Hulu all year? No just do it on and off for a couple months at a time to catch up on new shows/movies that came to the service- Do you need HBO all year? No just subscribe for the last month of your favorite program and catch up on all the shows.- Do you need the high end sports package with SEC, Texas, Pac10, and Big10 channels? No get those for the sports season of choice (at most thats September to February likely)If you are going to subscribe to a bunch services all at once you might as well stay with a cable bundle from a pricing perspective. That being said Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon combined have a lot more entertainment variety from my experience than even the 100 channel packages. The biggest difference is sports."

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Hi everyone--I'm Jefferson Graham, the author of the Cutting the Cord pieces. Thanks for chiming in today! Happy to answer questions. "
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",">To pick up the missing entertainment, it’s either $90 for an antennaI went into my attic and grabbed a 20 year old antenna from one of the first TVs I ever owned. I get all my local networks in better quality than I got with cable. You don't need to spend $90 on an antenna.>or $40 plus for a cable alternative service like YouTube TV or PlayStation VUE.Only if you're trying your hardest to duplicate the live TV cable experience. For those who don't live around the TV and just need some content to watch for a few hours a week, $10-$15 per month for any single streaming service at a time works just fine.>But many of us have TV/internet bundles that raise the price of internet if we drop TV.So glad I was not in that situation. Even when I had cable, it was a different company from my internet. "
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","We pay $47 for 150mbps Internet that we would have had anyway. Then if you figure it would be $30+ for cable TV and equipment even with bundling.If you add Netflix, Hulu, and prorate Amazon Prime due to the original reason we signed up was for shipping, we're probably spending $30 per month.Initially, we ditched cable because of the savings. It has evolved into some savings, but purely freedom, control, or whatever you are determined to call it.I'm not downloading content, all of my resources are legit, so hey, it's good in my book."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",I live out of range to use an antenna. I use Chromecast and pretty much live on Netflix.
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","The problem with a lot of articles like this is that they ignore that a huge segment of the population that pays for cable also already pays for Netflix and/or Amazon Prime and/or Hulu.   We paid for two of them (Netflix and Prime) before we cut cable so those are not new costs to us.   It's a very disingenuous comparison.  Granted every situation is different...but the savings can be very significant.We are saving about $900/year over what we paid for our cable bundle (based on their price two and a half years ago which has obviously increased each year, so we are probably saving much more now), and that was from our hard-earned ""discount"" that I negotiated every year.   The articles never seem to mention that, either, how different customers pay different prices for the exact same thing with cable, essentially based solely on who will roll over and just take it.Anyway, we not only have a lot more money but we have a much better overall viewing experience (PS VUE Elite pkg, Hulu no commercials, Netflix 4K plan, Amazon Prime, 30+ OTA channels, and tons of free streaming apps) and haven't missed one single thing we have wanted to watch in about two and a half years.   "
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","I just switched ISP to get 100 Mbps for 2 years at $29.99 per month using my own modem and router. Vue core at $50 pm. Much better value for me than the $175 combined I was paying when I cut the cord 2 years ago. I added ESPN+ at $4.99 pm to celebrate. (Netflix, Hulu, & Prime remain carry overs)"
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",I have never had a cable subscription and I have never really wanted one. For shows I just use netflix and hulu and other services and for sports I just have a live antenna hooked up to my tv and I get all of the sports that I actually want.
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","I don't pay any monthly fee for my antenna, let alone $90, as this guy writes, but I do pay Sling $25 monthly.  Even when saying he was wrong he tries to be right and shows he doesn't really know what he's supposedly knowledgeable about.  Like so much else that parades as ""journalism"" today."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","After getting an OTA antenna set up on my roof, connected to every TV in the house and a Tablo DVR, I sat down and flipped through each and every channel. Nothing on. It felt good though because at least I’m no longer paying monthly for nothing on. "
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","It was never about saving money for me. It was about not having to see fucking commercials. I'd pay *more* than cable to make sure I can do that (and probably do). My internet alone costs what some people pay for cable. ~$100, but I get gigabit speeds. I'd rather have a super fast internet for my dollars than more cable channels I won't watch."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Hey check out:- HDHomeRun (one time box that you purchase)- HDHomeRun Premium Service (gets you 40 ""cable"" channels) (monthly $35)- Plex Premium Pass (lifetime pass is single payment of $119)- Have Plex record Live TV without commericals (this is a benefit of the Plex Premium Pass)Its pretty amazing as I just started testing it with OTA and seems to work really well. I am going to be adding the HDHomeRun Premium service likely later this month to start testing."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","I saved $90/mo by dropping X1 but added $35 (now $40) for a grandfathered DirecTV Now Go Big. I paired that up with an antenna and Plex with a Lifetime Plex Pass for $75. I lost my RSN (NBC Sports Philadelphia), but that only means I miss Phillies game TV coverage (I still have radio).On the flip side, I travel a ton for work, so I bought the MLB.tv ""one team"" package ($42 one-time payment). I still get to watch Phillies games in my hotel for the rest of the year.I still get every Eagles game and the pre- and post-game Eagles coverage that's almost as good as NBCSP. I saved $50/mo to give up watching Phillies games the three days a week I'm at home.It's not a lot of money in the big picture of things, but the principle of it is worth so much more."

"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","The article says that spectrum is only $45 in a bundle.  My cable company has similar shenanigans for going to internet-only service.  There are a bunch of flaws in the article, but the cable bill dropping from $110 for a bundle to $70 for standalone non-promo pricing isn't one of them."
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV","Actually: I currently pay $110 monthly for cable and internet. My provider, as stated in the article, said they would charge me $70 monthly for Internet if I ditched cable. &#x200B;Jefferson GrahamUSA TODAY"
"Cutting the cord: Yes, you can save money ditching cable TV",Cord cutting always leaves out the sports fan. I need live channels for sports so it's not like I can just be fine with Netflix and Hulu for $25/mo. I pay $35/mo for YTV and I feel like it's the best deal. I miss out on some smaller sports channels that other services have but I get the majority of what I want/need.

Question about channel rescan,It may have switched tower locations due to the FCC auction/repack.
Question about channel rescan,"What device (TV make/model, TiVo, HDHR)? You might have to erase the old channel scan and ""reset to defaults"" (or some such verbage) depending. "
Question about channel rescan,"[Looks like they moved transmitter locations](https://fccdata.org/?appid=25076ff3651b83f201653ec7b2291352&facid=61084).

Question about channel rescan,">My local PBS station, WXEL, changed frequencies on Aug 22 but no matter how many times I rescan I'm not seeing it. Same with my PBS station.  That's because they moved to a different transmitter 20 miles more distant!  So no way I'm ever getting it."
Question about channel rescan,"Yeah, based on the new location I would need to remount my antenna in a different location but I'm not going to do it for PBS."
Directvnow or sling?,"In my opinion, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV are both superior in most respects. Especially if you remove cost from the equation. Both of those services are missing some channels you may want, but Philo is a good gap filler for just $16 per month. Directv Now may have the single best picture quality (by a narrow margin.) But the app is not very intuitive, it’s limited to 2 concurrent streams, and the DVR is both buggy and limited to just 20 hours of storage. Also cannot REW/FF live tv. They offer the option to purchase a third stream and will soon offer paid DVR tier. But if you’re getting in at the tier with Regional Sports Networks, you’re already facing a $55 per month bill before add-ons.With Sling, I was never impressed with the app or the streaming quality. Their small add-on packages are unique and may save money depending on your viewing habits. Or it could cost you just as much as any other service if you need channels from both Orange + Blue, sports add-on, lifestyle add-on, etc. Also note Disney/ESPN networks cannot be recorded and you can only stream to one device at a time. Sling also has poor support for local broadcast stations. Make sure you compare locals on all of the services. Unless you’re in a major US city, it’s unlikely that all services will have your ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox stations. An antenna may get you that programming for free, but you’ll have to add a separate DVR unless you always plan to watch live. "
Directvnow or sling?,"This!  DirecTV Now has pretty good picture quality, but that's debatable.  And DirecTV Now is definitely less reliable.  My wife actually thought Hulu with Live TV had the best of picture quality of what we tried, but it's really splitting hairs, all are pretty good as long as you have a good streaming device and good internet.  We actually use PS Vue right now with football season upon us and she thinks the picture if great there too.  If you have a desire for watching sports and want sports regional channels, DTV now starts to lose on the value proposition right away, as you can get regional sports for less on YTTV and Vue, with MORE included functionality like DVR and number of streams without having to pay an upcharge."

Currently trying to watch NCAA football on FS1, and had to switch over to Hulu. "
Directvnow or sling?,I prefer sling. Both work well tho. Try the free trial for both and see which packages work better for you. Everything depends on what you want and how much you want to spend 
Directvnow or sling?,Why do you prefer sling though? 
Directvnow or sling?,"After trying them all I ended up deciding on SlingTV as well. I want to check out Hulu with live tv after they are out of beta, as I found it to not function so well when I tried it last week. A lot of them also don't have a channel I like (Paramount)."
Directvnow or sling?,Been with sling for two years on Roku's.  No complaints here.
Directvnow or sling?,"I go with Sling for the OTA compatibility.Their $35 package ($25 basic and $10 special bundle add-on) works for us because everyone gets a bit of everything.You're locked to the app, though, as opposed to having a Brand name. What I mean by that is that some channel app (food network, FXX), won't recognize your Sling credentials, but they will recognize Spectrum or DirectTV (not to be confused with DirectTV Now), so you can't take advantage of *their* app. The most neat thing is that you can take it anywhere. I remember watching a FIFA game on the airport on my phone.For $120 and a bit of tech know how, you can get AirTV (the black box), and merge its OTA channels with Sling. That's what sealed it for my, since my mother watches OTA more than anything else, and all of the channels are centralized on one app. "
Directvnow or sling?,"Go with free trials of each. Honestly, don't overlook Playstation Vue - it's been the most reliable service for me."
Directvnow or sling?,Do you have to buy anything extra with the PlayStation vue? I honestly don’t know anything about it. 
Directvnow or sling?,"Have you looked into PS Vue (no you don't need a PlayStation), YouTube TV, or Hulu with Live TV?  I haven't tried Sling yet, but I find all of them to have better reliability/functionality than DTV Now."
Directvnow or sling?,"I’m gonna try them all, but the PlayStation vue looks pretty good. I have a Sony tv and wouldn’t have to buy any extra devices. "
Directvnow or sling?,"Went with Sling because they offered RSNs with $25/mo package. On DTV Now, minimum package with RSN is $50/mo (which approaches my cut $66/mo Cable TV).Also, Sling TV allows one to ditch $15/mo Disney/ESPN, if desired. And I desired. ESPN carves out Monday Night Football and MLB Sunday night, but that's not worth $180/yr to me, esp. since it’s just a money-grubbing carve out/unbundling simply to drive up user bills - ESPN is not a regular live game source for either of those leagues.  ESPN does add value for NCAA football and hoops, but there are many options for those besides ESPN. "
Directvnow or sling?,Neither... go PS Vue..   you won't regret it
Directvnow or sling?,I have a friend who did several free trials ; swears by PSV.
Directvnow or sling?,I agree with the comments around VUE.  Great for sports and a quality service.  Just wish it loaded a little faster on startup.  PLUS you can get the NFL Red Zone for $10 a month.
Directvnow or sling?,They have free trials and your concerns have more to do with things outside anyone elses setup your better off finding out for yourself because the variables are huge from house to house let alone city to city state to state ect. What works great for others may not work at all for you
Directvnow or sling?,Completely understand. 
Directvnow or sling?,"I like DTVN because they have Viacom channels and Fox News.  I could go with Sling, but they don't have Fox News.  Same with PS Vue, but they have FNC but not Viacom."
Directvnow or sling?,Try both free trials separately before cutting the cord if possible. That will give you the best idea of what channels you will miss the most (if any) and which service offers the better experience for you.
Directvnow or sling?,"Sling is blocking FS1 right now, even though the only point in having it right now is for college football.Can't watch the Michigan game, which I wanted to follow since I have friends that went there.Anyone know if DirecTV Now does the same thing?"
Directvnow or sling?,Someone on another thread said there’s a dispute between Fox Sports and Sling. I can confirm it’s working on YouTube TV and there were reports of it playing normally on other services. 
Directvnow or sling?,"There is no perfect streaming service when it comes down to price, channel availability, quality and features. All of them have their pros and cons. More or less you have to test them all out and decide which one best meets your needs.With that said, I prefer DTVN over Sling. More channels available, better picture quality, and longer list of Network apps you can unlock."
Directvnow or sling?,Network apps you can unlock?

How is sling tv's picture quality?,"Sling is on the level of your average cable TV provider. Compressed, but still passable HD.YouTube TV and DirecTV Now are superior to your average cable TV provider.When I tried Hulu, I was too concentrated on its constant buffering to worry about its PQ, so I can't say. I imagine that's ironed out now, though."
How is sling tv's picture quality?,Switched from Sling to Vue a few months ago and the pic quality is much better on Vue and it cost me $5 less than Sling. Sling still only has 28 channels at 60fps where all of Vues are. I’m using a Roku Streaming Stick 
How is sling tv's picture quality?,"Honestly, I've never had any issues. Most sports stations run 1080p, 60fps and everything else is at 1080p, 30 fps"
How is sling tv's picture quality?,"Unless sling tv has change significantly in the last couple months since I last tried it, all channels are 720p not 1080p. "
How is sling tv's picture quality?,"Something else to look for.  The vast majority of people that complain about ""picture quality"" actually have very bad settings set on their TVs."
"Cord Cutting ‘Taking a Breather’ Until Gen-Z Hits Workforce, Analyst Says","My 22, 19 and 17 year olds watch very little ota or cable channels, and they are very unlikely to sign up for a traditional cable package whether it's streaming or wired.  This is a cheerleader piece for the demoralized industry, and delusional."
"Cord Cutting ‘Taking a Breather’ Until Gen-Z Hits Workforce, Analyst Says","According to some metrics, GenZ, (iGeneration), starts at 1997.  Guess what? they're already in the workforce.  By the way, the only ""offical"" generation is Baby Boomers  (1946-1964).  GenX spans from 1965-1977 (or 83 depending on the source).  Xenialls are born between 1977-1985, (border between genX and Millenial). Millenial starts from 1978-1985.  GenZ starts anywhere between 1997-2005 to present day.Seriously, ""generations"" mean nothing.

"Cord Cutting ‘Taking a Breather’ Until Gen-Z Hits Workforce, Analyst Says","I think it's more than marketing.  I think that each seceeding generation inherits the values of its predecessors which is in turn shaped by things like technology and events experienced.  Today's generation hasn't faced the hardships of those who lived through the Depression and WWII and thus doesn't see the world through the same lens. I'd venture to say people's values have evolved as well.  Yeah, those are very broad generalizations and border on stereotypes."

Confessions of a Cord Cutter,You are not really supposed to drive an extra ground rod for grounding TV antennas anymore. You are supposed to ground to the power ground for the house.
Confessions of a Cord Cutter,I would expect the power company to object..... they don't want lightning strikes going across their wires (and possibly blowing-out transformers).
Confessions of a Cord Cutter,">So it was back to the future with over-the-air TV (OTA) using an antenna or what we Boomers used to call an aerialI'm not that old man.  I was born in 83, and I call it an aerial, (because it operates in the sky, and you put it up in the sky on a mast).  That's just what it is.>A few caveats: my unit purports to be good for more than one TV although AntennasDirect support told me reception takes a hit with that approach. Bear in mind, they want to sell more antennas. They also told me longer cable runs (don’t go more than 100 feet) affects reception adversely.So use a [distribution amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/Channel-Master-Distribution-Amplifier-Antenna/dp/B001PI09SE), and distribute it throughout your house.  Watch 4 TV's on one aerial if you wish.    Problem solved."

How to Get the Most Value Out of Philo,The article fails to mention Philo can also be watched on Fire TV and Apple TV :(
How to Get the Most Value Out of Philo,">Guide. This section is similar to a traditional guide, with a grid-style schedule showing what's on and what's coming up on each channel.Unless I'm missing something it does not offer a guide on the Roku.  I'm only seeing the Home, Live and Saved sections at the top.  A more traditional guide would be a welcome addition.  Maybe that's only available on the web version?Philo is pretty excellent though.  I use it along with Hulu Live to supplement the missing channels (Discovery, Cooking Channel, etc) that we watch.  I wish they'd move the Cooking Channel to their $16 tier though.  That's the only channel that requires me to upgrade to their $20 plan."
How to Get the Most Value Out of Philo,I have Philo on my Fire stick and Apple TV and the only place I've seen a guide is while  watching on the website
How to Get the Most Value Out of Philo,The guide is only on the web version for now. I recently switched from Hulu Live back to YTTV bc I realized I was really paying extra for a paltry DVR in comparison. I've always had Philo since I became a cord cutter in January and I love it. I just wish there was a dedicated Android app. 
How to Get the Most Value Out of Philo,Philo gives you **The Science Channel** in the basic package. That in of itself makes it attractive. But I am anxious about Discovery folks coming out with their own $5 per month service.

Tvfool help/antenna suggestion,"Flat panel antennas are mostly UHF, your NBC is VHF-Low (2-6) and CBS is VHF-Hi.

NFL on VUE,"If you get good OTA reception (and have an antenna already) and the the games are on your local stations, I would consider that as well. I get full 1080 HD on my antenna over VUE's 720. Sports are pretty much the only thing I care about getting that extra definition. VUE is still a perfectly good way to watch. "
NFL on VUE,1080i and 720p are essentially the same since 1080i is interlaced. no network broadcasts 1080p over the air today. having said that OTA usually does look clearer than cable or streaming
NFL on VUE,You should be good.  You should get all the local channels in Boston according to the Vue website and able to see all your pats games on CBS.  I enjoy it. if you are a fantasy football nerd like me adding NFL Redzone with the $10 Sports Pack add-on is greatness!  Love seeing all my fantasy players score when it happens.
NFL on VUE,have an antenna or fox sports go app (for the rare pats game on fox) ready as a backup in case of a rare service issue. don’t text with friends if you don’t want spoilers (internet streams tend to run about a minute behind ota and cable). 
NFL on VUE,"Interesting, I did't realize the streaming was about a minute behind.  I'm actually in NH and don't get much signal.  is the FOX app a paid thing?  "
NFL on VUE,I'm watching Vue right now with my local channels. The picture seems a little weird for my TV though (maybe that's because I'm using my PS4 Pro for it rather than my TV's Android TV or an Apple TV 4K)

Is NFL Network worth it ?,"Not only are all the local games simulcast OTA, Fox and Amazon and Twitch are simulcasting eleven national TNF games this season. So subscribing to the NFLN literally nets you two more games than you can get completely for free."
Is NFL Network worth it ?,[deleted]
Is NFL Network worth it ?,"If you only care about seeing Cowboys games it is not worth it at all.

PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,"I can't speak for Sling, but Vue works great.  Very reliable.  Definitely has Redzone in 60 FPS.  I've tried YTTV, Vue, DirecTV Now and Hulu Live.  Vue and YTTV were definitely my top 2, but I needed HGTV for the wife and Vue had it without me needing to add Philo, plus Vue had NFL Network/Redzone.  Where I live (Dallas) I have all my locals on Vue, and Sling only has NBC and Fox.  And Sling doesn't carry CBS period.  So you can't watch AFC games at all on Sling (but if you only watch via Redzone that may not matter)  Also FYI, Vue just added Smithsonian channel yesterday, which up to now I think YTTV was the only one who carried it of the major OTT channels.   Also Vue a week or two ago added back over 200 local channels.  Not sure where you live but you may want to check what locals you have available on Vue if you haven't checked recently."
PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,Well said!  I have Vue and LOVE it for all of the reasons you outlined.   
PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,PS vue..    We use vue at home no problem.  Son went to college and we thought we would go cheap with sling/redzone.   Horrible.  laggy and stuttering.thought it was school wifi but signed him up for vue/redzone and butter baby..   Smooth 
PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,Does he have his own vue account or are you both using the same Vue account?   Vue doesn't care if you have different IPs logging in?
PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,"No issues with Vue or Sling for me. However I haven't checked RedZone yet since it's off air still. I was using my PS4 for Vue and my FireTV 2, FireTV 3 pendant to watch on my 4K Samsung.That being said, Vue and Sling can be terrible for people stuck on some ISPs that have whacky routing. If you're getting sent to a CDN that is too far away from your stream you're going to have buffering and quality issues. "
PS Vue or Slingtv for Redzone,Sling to my knowledge does not offer Redzone at 60fps

New Research Shows We’re Now at Peak OTT,"> Showtime had the highest churn rate, which means bringing in consumers before they leave, among providers, according to the analysis, and Netflix had the lowest. Showtime’s churn rate was more than 95 percent, while Netflix had a rate of less than 10 percent, according to the research.This might explain two things... Showtime’s recent $4.99 3-month summer sale and the forthcoming increase to $10.99 from $8.99. From a consumer standpoint, there’s beauty in not having to subscribe every month if you choose not to. And the services need to take that into account and rethink how and when they program their series to help decrease the churn rate. Unfortunately they still plan programming for a linear audience. "

Here’s the caveat to the story, as described by [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/california-net-neutrality-bill-would-go-beyond-original-protections/): “The California bill would allow zero rating in some cases. For example, *a carrier could exempt a category of apps or services, as long as the exemption applied to all services in that category*. T-Mobile's Binge On and Music Freedom, which zero rate a large number of streaming video and music services, might be allowed. T-Mobile claims that all services that meet its technical requirements can be included in the service. The California bill would also allow carriers to zero rate all data under certain circumstances. For example, a provider could let people use unlimited amounts of data at night, but charge for data use during the day.”"

Can someone help me decipher this?

This:* https://rabbitears.info/market.php?request=station_search&callsign=wgxa#station... shows that ABC and FOX are on the same transmitter (WGXA).If you point your antenna northeast you should be good to go for the 4 major networks.

From 86 miles away and the -4.7db 2 edge signal strength; it likely won’t be easy and might not be possible to get a consistent NBC signal even with the best antenna/pre-amp mounted on a tall tower.As for direction, like bk845 said, point it directly at NBC, and the other green one’s “should” be strong enough. If you also want to try for CW and PBS, you’ll probably want a rotor so you can spin the antenna to point at those."

"Router, Modem or Provider?","I’ve been having issues lately on the 5GHz spectrum and quickly identified the issue being the other WiFi networks around me.  I live in an apartment and many years ago noticed the 2.4GHz spectrum was jam packed with routers owned by neighbors.  At that time (Oct 2012), I was the ONLY person with a 5GHz SSID. Never had an issue until this past month. Now almost all the 5GHz channels are occupied by neighbors with newer equipment from their ISPs. When my network starts having issues, I use the Speedtest app on my phone to verify I’m experiencing a device wide endpoint issue and not an “app” issue when I notice a slowdown. Then I use an iOS app called Fing to determine wether or not I can hit the router from the endpoint, and most importantly, the latency. When all is well, 2-3ms is the latency. When there’s an issue pertaining to RF interference on my WiFi channel, the latency is MUCH higher. When I see a high ping to the router, I fire up a PC and launch a program called INSSIDER to identify the SSID and channels of the networks around me. 100% of the time I get a high ping to the router with Fing, I will find that a neighbor’s 5GHz WiFi Network has landed on my channel. I then manually change the channel and of my 5GHz network and the problem is resolved immediately.  I’m wondering if I should set my network channel to AUTO instead of manually setting the channel.  😆"

"Router, Modem or Provider?",Have you looked into any updates for your router/modem? I ran into this issue a while back and the provider suggested it as they saw no interruptions in the service on their end. I looked into it and there was an update for my router. Once I updated it I haven't had to reset the modem and router since then.
"Router, Modem or Provider?","My DSL modem loses connection every other day.  It's just noise on the phone line.  The problem will fix itself, but it's faster to just switch off/then on the modem."

"Router, Modem or Provider?",Many modems have an HTTP interface you can connect to check the logs for errors.

Amazon Prime Video Data High Usage,"Amazon says that 4K streaming requires at least a 15 Mbps connection. Streaming at exactly 15 Mbps for 1 hour comes to 6.75 GB, so the ""about 6.84 GB per hour"" estimate you're seeing on your laptop is probably for 4K video. Amazon recommends at least 3.5 Mbps connection for 720p HD video, which comes to about 1.5 GB per hour. Double that to about 3 GB per hour for 1080p.Of course, this can vary greatly depending on what you're watching because the streams use a variable bitrate, not a fixed bitrate. Videos with many small and fast moving components, like rain, will use a lot more bandwidth than videos with many static images, like a space documentary. The values of 1.5 GB, 3 GB, and 6.75 GB per hour for 720p, 1080p, and 4K are likely the minimum amounts to expect, since those values correlate to the lowest connection requirements for each stream quality.If you're concerned about bandwidth usage, be sure you're using a streaming device that supports HEVC H.265 video decoding. Such a device will consume less bandwidth than an older device that only supports H.264, while producing the same image quality.The current (2nd-gen) [Fire TV Stick](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ZV9RDKK/) is a good option for a low-cost HEVC H.265 device. Amazon also added new [quality settings](http://www.aftvnews.com/you-can-now-select-from-3-video-quality-settings-on-the-amazon-fire-tv-and-fire-tv-stick/) and [bandwidth monitoring](http://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-can-now-monitor-data-usage-and-alert-you-when-youve-reached-a-data-cap/) last year to all Fire TV models. They let you reduce the quality setting from ""Best"" to ""Better"" which will reduce the bandwidth usage by almost half without affecting the image quality much. You can drop the quality to ""Good"" for a 90% reduction in bandwidth usage, but the image is noticeably worse. You can also set a bandwidth limit in the OS so that it warns you, or even cuts you off, when you exceed a certain amount. You can also set what day of the month your billing cycle resets, so that the bandwidth tracker automatically resets."

Only Netflix 4K + HDR rivals it (according to my eyes).Looking up bit rates on their site, Amazon claims to use 15mbps minimum for 4K HDR. That is 6.75GB/hr. I'm sure Amazon will send more if the bandwidth allows."

DirectTV satellite price matched YouTube TV...now what?,"DirecTV Satellite quality is better, but it varies by channel as to how much.  Really 5.1 audio is the main difference (which is somewhat important to me.)  The thing is this deal is for one year on a two year agreement (most likely.)  So after one year, be prepared for a price hike or to pay the $240 or so early termination fee to cancel.  I did a similar loyalty thing to go back to them but after my one year promo I'll probably pay the fee and bug out.  I'm hoping by then streaming services will be marginally better or there will be more alternatives."

"Will I be able to receive football games from NY stations with an indoor antenna? If so, please recommend one. (TV Fool report included)",Yes.  When I was in NY it worked.

He won't get anything with the Mohu because it's too small with almost no gain.  All of his stations are ""2 edge"" which means they are behind two mountain ridges (and weak).   - OP: The largest indoor antenna you can get is the CM4228, and even with that you might get few channels.  I use it, unamplified, and get signals 60 miles distant, but I don't have any mountains in the way.  Another option is an outdoor antenna like this.

"Will I be able to receive football games from NY stations with an indoor antenna? If so, please recommend one.

If you have a small portable TV break it out so you can move the antenna easily around the house. Clearstream 2max was what worked best for me but reception is a weird thing so try a bunch of antennas.If you have a second story window looking in the correct direction that's the spot to start to see if you can get reception.

Seal antenna mast lag holes on roof?,"I would just use roofers cement for everything (the tube of stuff from your link is a brand of roofers cement)...Here is my standard text for mounting a tripod mount on asphalt shingles (mostly applies):* Throw away the ""pitch pads"" that come along with it. Instead use roofing cement from the local home improvement store.* While at the store get the largest lag bolts that will fit through the holes and use those if they are larger than the ones that came with the tripod.* Drill out the holes, but only to about half the bolt diameter. You want the shingles to fit tight to the round part of the bolt. Put a blob of cement in the hole as well as a layer under the flat part of the foot.* Use 2 bolts per foot. If you miss the board then use a third bolt in the third hole (leave the loose one in).* Don't over tighten. The shingles should be noticeably  compressed but not to the point where they are starting to be cut by the edge of the foot.* Don't under tighten. When you grab the top of the tripod and heave as hard as you can there should be no movement at the feet.* You can use a 10 foot chain link fence top rail from the home improvement store as a mast."

Marvel's Black Panther is Now Streaming on Netflix,"I was looking forward to this film, since everyone raved about it when it was released, and it did so well at the box office. But so far, half way through it, I've found it boring and predictable; and actually a bit worse than the average Marvel film of recent years. Yeah, sure, it has all that eye candy CGI; and its basic quota of action. But the story is lacking. Plus, it's supremely stupid that the fate of a whole country rides on who's better in a physical fight. Ugh! Talk about a high school mentality... and in a supposedly technologically advanced society!I hope the second half is lots better than the first. :-(Disclosure: I've not been all that crazy about MOST of the Marvel films of recent years.

Flexible coaxial cable for antenna?,"I'm not a pro, but in my experience, the more flexible a coax is, the lower the quality. It's why cable techs always do installs with super stiff stuff. It's reliable.Every time I've swapped those cables out for flexible ones, I've experienced signal problems. Even on digital cable. Some channels were pixelated or just wouldn't come thru at all.I'm betting flexibility is even more problematic over longer runs, which is why you're having problems finding them."
Flexible coaxial cable for antenna?,"I wondered if that was the reason. On one hand the cable /u/sglville mentioned has reviews using it for the exact same purpose as me. On the other hand, there already are a couple channels that get unreliable signal with the cable that came with the antenna, so maybe a better cable would work out.I guess I don't know what the trade off between antenna location and cable type is, or if you can even make one.Supposing I used a stiff cable, any suggestions on routing it without it exerting too much force on the antenna or whatever is used to route the cable? "
Flexible coaxial cable for antenna?,This seems thin and its blue (for whatever reason) but lookup C2G 27229 on amazon 
Flexible coaxial cable for antenna?,"You shouldn't have any trouble running running coax for your antenna with standard rg6 coax.  The smaller cable is going to either use a smaller copper or have inferior shielding.If you see a cable installer, just stop and ask him for some cable clips, most of them will give you a handful.  These are plastic clips which screw or nail to the baseboard.  Its possible your baseboard is properly installed and there is a gap between baseboard and carpet/tile that you can push the cable into so that it is not visible.  As far as turns, don't bend cable at a 90, the plastic outer coating should remain wrinkle-free.  Basic rule is, don't bend it anymore than necessary and never at a 90.  When it gets a crimp in it, the shielding can get damaged and you may lose channels or have poor picture quality, sound quality and any of a number of intermittent issues.Just an FYI, it is better to get cable from either a cable or satellite installer rather than walmart or somewhere else, including those high dollar monster cables.  Most cable guys will cut you a piece for free, probably make the ends up for you too.  For five bucks I know it will happen. tip: cable companies use copper coated steel, directv and dish, {probably all satellite companies} always have solid copper center conductors.Good lucktldr: Find a cable guy on the street and ask him to make you a cable."

PlayStation VUE Error- (Contract Restriction),I get it on occasion when my local sports teams are being broadcast on both their regional (home) channel and national television (like MLB Network).Was it a local talk show or something like Good Morning America?
PlayStation VUE Error- (Contract Restriction),"this was ""LIVE with Kelly and Ryan"" ...So a national broadcast."
PlayStation VUE Error- (Contract Restriction),The local Boston station has first-rights to broadcast that show...... national carriers like PS Vue or Comcast or Dish are forbidden to broadcast it.  (Although they can retransmit the Boston station.)  It's simply a way for the local stations to protect themselves from outside competition.

Thinking of installing antenna in the Attic,"For outside/attic? Then you would want some sort of UHF/VHF-high antenna.

Netflix and Amazon Prime Video will have to make more European content – by law,It's actually more like traditional cable providers found a way to stifle competition by imposing ridiculous limitations.
Netflix and Amazon Prime Video will have to make more European content – by law,"Makes sense. The main reason the EU looks more free-trade than the USA right now is that the USA picked the first out-and-out mercantilist president in ages. The EU is an amalgamation of different countries with different ideologies and political centers. For instance, Swedish Social Democrats tend to be far more free trade than Greek center-rightists. And the policies may not vary on a party-by-party basis too; in many cases the economic policies of the former standard bearer of the French center-left Parti Socialist vary relatively little with those of Les Republicans (*formerly known as the UMP, no relation to the U.S. one*). The French in particular tend to be very *particular* when it comes to cultural content, especially movies, hence why this does not surprise me at all.Note the following:1. The ""law"" is not a law yet; it was proposed by the European Commission (*essentially the ""cabinet""/executive branch of the EU*) and has yet to be passed by the legislature (*The European Parliament, essentially the House of Representatives in U.S. speak*). The Commission thinks this may be a formality though, and they might be right. The most ""classically liberal"" country is in a secessiony situation which means the others are less likely to get back a more free-market approach, and they may want more ""aid"" for their services too. And hey, as long as the USA is trying to carve out advantages for itself, why not protect their own continent with a moat before the USA gets in first?"

Suggestions for VHF in LA,"Being on the NE side of the building, you should have line of site to the transmitters and really good signal.  If your current antenna has an amp (that's removable) try without it.  If not, just get a cheap pair of rabbit ears (like from RCA or whoever.  You can usually find some in stores locally).  You really shouldn't need more than that unless you have some obstructions between you and the tower that TVFool isn't accounting for.  (I have a friend who lives in Mar Vista that gets everything with rabbit ears.)"
Suggestions for VHF in LA,"Like the OP I too lived only 20 miles away from the transmitter, but when I tried a pair of VHF rabbit ears plus UHF loop..... I too had trouble getting the stations.

Suggestions for VHF in LA,"> Any suggestions?Yes.  Please tell us what antenna you're using, so we don't have to guess.  I suspect it's a UHF antenna that cannot get KTTV or KABC, therefore you need a VHF-capable antenna (like the CM4228)- By the way, you're only 20 miles away from the transmitter, but when I tried a pair of VHF rabbit ears plus UHF loop.....

Suggestions for VHF in LA,"I live in SW Los Angeles (about a few miles east of LAX), also about 20+ miles from Mount Wilson (L.A.'s main TV/FM transmission site, for you out-of-towners).  I use a RCA indoor flat antenna with a signal booster...the antenna by itself works just fine, but the booster does help a bit.  Even with that, as long as I have the antenna wire straightened (and not mixed-up with the other wires connected to the TV, etc.), and position the antenna in the right spot (facing due east, with plenty of line of sight towards the mountain ranges), I normally have no signal problem.  All four hi-VHFs on the L.A. dial (KABC, KCAL, KTTV, KCOP) can be problematic at times with reception, but for the most part, I don't have a problem picking them up.If you can pick up KCOP's signal (and can't get KTTV), you can still view KTTV/Fox programming via one of their subchannels, on channel 11.2.  Two things though--11.2 is in standard definition, and the feed is about 10-15 seconds behind of 11.1  Channel 11.3 (Light TV) also comes from KCOP's digital spectrum...the only actual subchannel KTTV has is their own--11.1.  Another thing to note, KABC is also channel-sharing with KRCA (62.1/Estrella TV), and between the subchannels each one of them carries, the picture quality probably won't be as a great as before."
Suggestions for VHF in LA,"I think I'll be OK with a slightly improved antenna: As I was aligning my cheap-o flat antenna with my hand, I'm sure my body acted as a RF conduit and I was able to pull KTTV without a problem. "
How much bandwidth do HDHR devices use?,"TL;DR unless you’re planning on remote viewing using Channels or Plex, you have nothing to worry about when concurrently streaming Directv, Netflix, and HDHR content since the HDHR is located in your home.It’s important to understand that bandwidth doesn’t really count when you’re streaming from local devices. Are you planning on allowing remote DVR access? If yes, you can specify the data size you allow for remote streaming (remote meaning you’re watching Live TV or DVR recordings while away from home). If you’re only going to be watching OTA channels while you’re home, I guess you’ll only need to worry about the throughput of your router. Most recent home WiFi routers are 1gig and support 802.11n and 802.11ac"
How much bandwidth do HDHR devices use?,Im using the isp provided router which is a pace 5268ac
How much bandwidth do HDHR devices use?,"If you're using your HDHomeRun to receive OTA channels it does not use your internet's bandwidth.  It gets those channels ""over the air"" via an antenna.  Only the HDHomeRun Premium TV service will use your internet bandwidth.Now if you're running everything on WiFi locally, that could create issues if your WiFi speeds aren't great (like due to distance from your router or if you live in an apartment/condo that has lots of different wifi networks all sharing the same space).  In that case it'd be best to have whatever devices you can connected to the ethernet.  But that's completely independent of your internet speed."
How much bandwidth do HDHR devices use?,"> I hear ota uses about 18mbps.Yes but divided across 2-to-3 subchannels, so 18 divided by 3 channels.  Plus OTA uses obsolete MPEG2 technology.   On the internet they use MPEG-4 codec, which sends the same picture at Half the bitrate.  Some sites used MPEG-5 or equivalent, which sends the same picture at a Quarter the bitrate.   - One HD stream would need 2 Mbps minimum.- Ultra HD approximately quadruple:  8 Mbps- If you have more than one person in the house, multiply  these numbers by X number of people.  You said ""2"" so that would be 4 Mbit/sec for two videos at HD..... 16 Mbit/s for two videos at UltraHD"
How much bandwidth do HDHR devices use?,"It uses 14GB/hr. 70GB/hr if 4K. 7GB/hr for SD, and 10GB/hr for 720p&#x200B;"

"T-Mobile will sell wireless-only TV, broadband bundle through Layer3 TV","That may work for 720p but 4k if they do it honestly, it would be like wait 5 minutes while we buffer."
"T-Mobile will sell wireless-only TV, broadband bundle through Layer3 TV",well if they get 5G working well then there shouldn't be any buffering.  still though I hate to be in a congested urban area where thousands of people share one tower.

"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","We used Philo to justify cutting back our Playstation Vue subscription, based on their recent price hikes.We were paying $60 a month for Vue before the price hike. Now we have their minimal package plus the $20 premium Philo package. We get more channels than before (like A&E) and pay less money. IMHO the optimal cord-cutting package right now is the lowest end Playstation Vue or YouTube TV package + the high-end Philo package, together. Same shows as we used to watch with cable, for less money. This sort of worries me though:>Philo is reportedly using some of the cash influx to develop “a socially-driven TV experience.”I don't need to share my viewing experiences on social media, thanks anyway Philo. How about you get me an Android app instead? "
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","If I recall, they've always said the social stuff would be optional, but some of the stuff they talked about early on sounded pretty cool, like synchronized watch parties with friends."
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",It's about collecting data and selling the data as another revenue stream I bet.That's what these guys do. Data is the new oil.
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","That's where I am too. Philo + lowest-cost DTVN. Better channel selection than I ever had with Dish or cable.As for social media, Philo's been promising that since early on. I presume they saw advertising potential there.I still kind of wish Philo had a guide on Roku ... but to be honest not having the guide saves wasted time endlessly looking for something good on ""live"" TV. Instead, the most ""popular"" live programs are highlighted."
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","Philo has said from the beginning that they were working on some kind of social interaction for their service, so that doesn't surprise me. From what I recall from previous statements, I think it might include as one of its features some way to watch things with friends remotely, if they also have a subscription, but don't quote me on it. It would be amazing though, as there is currently no streaming service that officially has this feature."
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",I don't think this is new news just a reposting of a story from a few weeks ago. Philo has been on the Fire TV and Apple TV for some time now.
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","I'm a little disappointed that it's been months since they've said they were working on a guide, as well as better device support, and we still don't have a guide (outside of crappy one in the browser) and they haven't even released an iPad app -- which should be pretty easy as they already have one for iPhones. "
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",Philo has become our top streaming service. We watch it about 90% of the time when we stream videos. More than Basic Hulu and Netflix combined.
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices","Maybe I'm old, but what's the point in the ""socially-driven TV experience""? If I'm watching a show, I want to watch the show - not worry about social media crap being built in to distract from trying to watch TV. Philo is great, but there are two items that should take priority over trying to add social media content to watching TV:1. GUIDE. I realize that many folks don't like watching Live TV these days, and rather watch On-Demand or DVR'd shows. However, if you're just curious about what's on, what's coming on next, etc..., then a guide is needed.2. Android device support. Android is the #1 used mobile OS on the planet, but there's no app for native support. I just hope that Philo allows a way to opt-out/disable any social media features that they are determined to focus on with their service. "
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",Philo low package + Hulu with Live TV and no commercials is the sweetspot for me
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",Are there commercials in the Philo package?
"TV Streaming Service Philo Raises $40 Million In Funding, Arrives On New Devices",When one DVRs programs in Philo one can fast-forward past advertisements. The FFWD function includes thumbnails making it easy to see where the commercial breaks end.

What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"In what direction is your antenna pointed now? I am wondering whether the reception problem is due to signal strength in the attic or most of your stations are in one direction but FOX (at 291°) and NBC (at 288°) are just in the wrong direction. You may be able to improve reception to those channels by rotating the antenna to a different direction where it is now.Also, this is not a big antenna. Having it on the roof instead of in the attic wouldn't be very noticeable IMO. As long as you don't have the antenna cable running all the way down the house. If you can bring the cable into the attic and hook it up to what you have there, that should be a pretty un-noticeable installation. Don't go on your roof unless you have the necessary skills and physical ability. Also, pay attention to grounding and other installation best practices. "
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"I do have it pointed at the stations, basically WNW. Pulled out a compass and everything. "
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"Hard to say for sure without knowing exactly what aspect of the signal the TV doesn't like. By the HDHR you have really good signals. You don't want a preamp, you have close strong signals. You could try the reflectors on the hope that you might eliminate some reflection/noise that is causing your problem. The MAX isn't very directional.Since strength is not your problem, you would probably just be putting the MAX on the roof if it turns out the signals are somehow better, higher.Try turning off all your electronics, including LED and CFL lighting, to check for interference."
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"Is 75-80% considered pretty good? I’ve got a few that are like 100%, that’s what I was comparing to."
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"there are no other electronics in the attic, so I double interference is the issue. There’s some on the other side of the wall though.Would a different antenna like the 4Max help or am I better off just trying the reflector?Thanks!"
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,When i setup my antenna I used the HDHomeRun CLI (https://www.silicondust.com/hdhomerun/hdhomerun_development.pdf) to find the best direction to point the antenna. It was crazy how much of a difference for me just moving a little made. I made a quick script to tune to each channel and find the signal and I would move it then run the script until I found the best way to point it. It could be there is nothing you can do to help but it can't hurt to check.
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,Would you be willing to share that script?
What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,"With 80%/100% you should not be getting drops. I would rule out the antenna or HDHR problem. Something electronic is causing interference with the signal is my guess. Make sure you're using RG6 shielded cable. If you are using a splitter, make sure any unused terminals are capped. Might also check the ethernet cable going to your routers ethernet port and use a cat5e cable. Here's a link to a filter that might help...Good luck!!!https://www.channelmaster.com/TV_Antenna_LTE_Filter_p/cm-3201.htm"

What can I do to increase signal quality / strength?,Upgrade from the 2-bay Clearmax to an 8-bay CM4228 (4 times more sensitivity).  Since you're in an attic you might also consider this compact but powerful antenna:http://dennysantennaservice.com/hd_stacker_tv_antenna-html.html

My 0.05¢ HD antenna,"I've been here for a while and never had cable. Was happy with streaming but wanted the Comet channel as background noise. I started researching HD antennas and didn't want to pay $20+ for something I would rarely use. On a whim, I stripped ~6"" of copper hookup wire I had lying around and shoved into the antenna jack. Scanned for channels and are getting 23 with 14 HD with ~70% signal strength on average. I do live in a major city and am on the 20th floor with clear view, so I consider myself very lucky. When I was in NYC, I lived less than a mile from the Empire State Building and even with an antenna I couldn't get any semblance of a signal."

Why YouTube include Cheddar in lineup instead of AXS,Cheddar isn't charging YouTube $5 per user. YouTube TV prices went up this year because they added Turner channels like CNN and TBS.
Why YouTube include Cheddar in lineup instead of AXS,There’s no magic formula for adding channels. They have to consider costs of every network and the (perceived) appeal it holds for both current and prospective subscribers. Send feedback to YTTV.

Any other free or super inexpensive services I'm missing?,"I use the free version of Crunchyroll lots more than Netflix, during many months of good content drought on Netflix. Free Youtube can be okay for short stints, like eating lunch, or on a work break (but it can take it a while to learn your preferences, and start offering you anything truly interesting).I wish more streaming services would act like Netflix, and let you resume a video you had to stop at random, even weeks or months later. That's a major failing of Crunchyroll, and many other free services. For if you have to leave something and return to it later, you have to start from the beginning again, and sit through all the commercial intervals you already did. So lots of the time I never return to one of those episodes again; and try to see an entire episode in one sitting if at all possible."

Any other free or super inexpensive services I'm missing?,pluto is pretty good for being totally free.  the advertisements though get on my nerves at times especially when they run just when a good part of the show is starting.  beggers can't be choosers though.

I have questions about Hulu programming,"With streaming services, there are no absolutes. Every deal for every show can be different. It starts with ownership of the show, where the production company has a deal with the network which stipulates how long they have rights to play the shows. Once the deal with the network has run its course, producers are free to sell streaming rights to another entity. (Sometimes the network and production company are the same, sometimes not.) There could be lags of months or years from the original broadcast to appearance on a streaming service. You could see individual seasons appear and disappear in accordance with the deal. Bottom line: what you see is what you get. If you want more current shows, look into a cable-like “live” streaming service.  Hulu runs one called “Hulu Live TV.” Others include YouTube TV, Directv Now, PlayStation Vue and Philo. "
I have questions about Hulu programming,WYSIWYG!
I have questions about Hulu programming,Look into Philo.
I have questions about Hulu programming,With Hulu it really depends on the network/show. For example major network stuff is typically next day. While cable channel stuff can vary from being added 3 weeks later to being not added until the next season is starting.&#x200B;
I have questions about Hulu programming,Are you trying Hulu with Live TV or regular Hulu? Hulu Live has HGTV in their lineup and I'm able to see all the way to Season 161 of House Hunters on Demand.  (I have Hulu with Live TV)
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,The Roku has a remote which a Chromecast currently does not. Just an FYI. I replaced my Chromecast shortly after starting with YouTube TV as I didn't like needing to use my phone or pc to control via the Chromecast.
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,"That seals it for me, Roku all the way. Thank you "
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,If you like a remote control go with Roku. The interface is probably the easiest of all streaming devices. Initial setup takes maybe 15 minites then you are good to go. The only thing Chromecast does better is screen mirroring. 
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,Any recommendation in the Roku stick+ vs ultra Roku player?
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,"Roku Stick+ if you want a low profile device, useful if you have your TV mounted on a wall. Private listening via phone app only.Roku Ultra if you want Ethernet, USB, and a headphone jack in the remote for private listening mode."
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,may also want to check on whether one is wifi only or not.
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,Roku+ is more for 4k tv's. If you're using a 1080p hd monitor/tv then roku express would be fine
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,"Update - chose the Roku Ultra player for the Ethernet connection, my WiFi can be unreliable. Using it for the first time tonight, so far very happy with it.The interface is easy, but not as intuitive as I’d like. I’d like to be able to move apps in the home screen and for the extra apps it comes with they are not clear on what requires subscriptions. Less than an hour in so I’m sure I’ll get used to it as I use it more.Thanks for the help!"
Advice - Roku or Chromecast for YouTube TV?,"You can move the apps around.  Just press the * button on the remote when the app is highlighted, then choose the ""Move"" option.Also, in the description of the app, it will generally say whether an additional subscription is required."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,Most cable boxes are junk and aren't worth the price of 1 months rental fee.
Cable Box vs Streaming device,Had Verizon FIOS TV and noted that my Apple TV streaming device had better video *and* audio quality. 
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"Buy the best box available, of whatever type you choose (Apple TV, Roku, etc.) Cheaper devices—including sticks—are inherently less powerful. You’ll find them slower to load content, slower to navigate, more prone to crashing, older devices will lose support from manufacturer sooner. If you plan to increase your streaming consumption in the near future, do yourself a favor and get a really good box. It’s a one-time purchase and not an area where you want to skimp. "
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"Great advice, it always baffles me when people cancel cable then buy a $30 streaming device from 3 years ago and think it sucks."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"Not that I’ve noticed. I got rid of Directv about 2 years ago and have both a roku and fire stick. Both are fine, as long as you have reliable and quick internet. (Im on a 75mb plan) and have no interruptions watching multiple things at once all while on our mobiles, etc."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"There should be. IP networks were never designed to carry video. The fact they work so well is a tribute to advances in video compression.We've not seen any difference in video quality between a fiber based HD Motorola cable box (MPEG2) and a cheap Roku 2 (H.264).If your IP connection is iffy, I would expect the streamers to downgrade image quality tho. This isn't related to internet speed...more due to consistency."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,Streaming device. There are numerous services out there to get live TV if your worried about that. I have a Roku TV and a Nvidia Shield.  The type of streaming device you invest in should be based on what services you plan on using and your technical knowledge.
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"For Xfinity, their “beta” streaming app doesn’t work half of the time (crashes, hangs) - so we aren’t completely sold on that, yet. Unfortunately our cable connections aren’t conveniently located by our TV sets so we are kind of stuck with streaming. We haven’t canceled YouTube TV yet due to the problems."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"It literally pains me to watch TV on a cable box now (at my mother's house, or my mother-in-law's house). The pixelation and picture quality is awful.I'd go so far as to say that picture quality on streaming devices is significantly better than cable boxes."
Cable Box vs Streaming device,[deleted]
Cable Box vs Streaming device,"No you don't! OTA in the US is either 720p or 1080i, your TV is probably upscaling to 4k but the original signal is definitely NOT 2160p."
Please advise me on antennas!,"After some pitched battles with our own attic antenna system and having to throw 50 yrs of textbook theory away...can assure you that attic installs can be vastly inferior to ""open air installs"".That said, give the many ways you can go wrong - perhaps damaging your roof membrane, would try an attic install every time FIRST.The key here is to wipe away your hubris. Never believe you understand all factors involved.Perform your calculations as best you can, select the antenna which should work, then hook it up. If it doesn't deliver, take the gamble of adding a 30db amplifier. Such amplifiers are notorious for their instability and lack of overload headroom....but your case might be different. That roof/shingle system might have a loss of 30db - so all you are doing is putting things back the way they wuz.The equivalent circuit of an attic based antenna is a roof/shingle loss device (attenuator) ahead of your antenna. The loss device should reduce RF noise along with that signal...so your amplifier may NOT turn things into a noisy mess.https://www.channelmaster.com/TV_Antenna_Preamplifier_p/cm-7777.htmYour install is ""an original"". Unique. Do not fall into the trap of believing you can avoid experiments."
Please advise me on antennas!,">,,, we do have a radiant barrier as someone else pointed out so that might cause issues.Very likely. You have to be willing to try an attic antenna anyway, there are lots of reasons they might not work.>Are there any advantages to putting the antenna outside vs in the attic?Well height for one thing. If your house in on the top of a hill then it might not make much difference but most people will end up clearing a lot of obstructions if they go beyond roof height. Also, the building materials the roof is made from will block signals to some extent. One rule of thumb is that it will reduce your signal strength by about half.Here are some appropriate antennas for either the attic or the roof:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018... pointed a bit south of due east before any further adjustment...Ref: https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?mktid=35"
Please advise me on antennas!,The elevation shouldn’t be a problem it’s a relatively new neighborhood so very few trees and it’s a tall house. The few large trees in the backyard are far enough away from the house.I feel like the two you recommended would have to go in the attic otherwise I’ll have to fight with the hoa. One of our neighbors has a mohu air 60 which no one complains about because it’s so small and dark like the roof.I’ll do some more research on the two you recommended when I get home. If you think we’ll get more channels/better reception.Example Of neighbors but his is slightly more discrete https://goo.gl/images/2WaQBa
Please advise me on antennas!,"Check the signal strength of the local towers at your location. https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps This will help you decide. Your geography, location, and terrain can all be a factor. I live less than 30 miles from multiple towers and get zero reception. I know people 75 miles away, who get great reception. An outdoor antenna can definitely improve reception, but may not be necessary."
Please advise me on antennas!,I couldn’t figure out how to share it while saving the address so I took a screenshot. Looks like I should get a couple stations based on both tvfool and fcc.govhttps://imgur.com/a/VP3dbHW
Please advise me on antennas!,I did this. Your mileage may vary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJ9_YveIPhc
Please advise me on antennas!,That’s really hard to believe. I’d think think it was a joke if it wasn’t slightly plausible in a macguyver type way.Unfortunately we also have cats which would knock them out and two of the TVs are in the basement where I’d imagine reception would be bad without an external antenna. Still a really cool thing though! Thanks!  
"Best ""inexpensive"" television",Do a trial of each service and see what you like best. Local channel availability often varies quite a bit between services. 
"Best ""inexpensive"" television",I am pretty happy with Vue. And you don't need a PlayStation to stream it. 
"Best ""inexpensive"" television",I'm assuming Vue doesn't work on the Xbox haha
"Best ""inexpensive"" television",Depends on what you want and what you get with your antenna. You might want to consider researching a better antenna.

"Best ""inexpensive"" television",Lots of great info. Thank you. 
"Best ""inexpensive"" television","We cut the cord 3 years ago and never found a good solution until now... We tried Sling, PS Vue, and Philo... Our main focus the NFL games! Ended up choosing Spectrum Choice for 24.99 a month. The cool thing is we get all the local channels too and get to choose 10 channels from a list and most of your PICKS are there. NFL Network is going to give you all the games. Might be a day late but you will see them and you can quit whenever (wink) (wink).  We paired it with Netflix and we are good! Check out an article and the channel list [here](https://thestreamingadvisor.com/spectrum-tv-choice/)! No cable box required and yes they have a free 7-day trial... Good Luck! "

"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",I left DTN for YTTV.  I think you will be very happy with it.
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",Cool!  Will have to get Philo to go with it as my wife “has to have” HGTV lol
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now","Why all the issues with DTVN?  I have it on my Fire TV 4k and it works great.&#x200B;Have any of y'all checked your networking equipment?  I use a Ubiquiti AP and router (enterprise grade).  These consumer APs really start to show how much they suck after you put more than two devices on them.&#x200B;Ethernet will provide the best, consistent throughput too.  Also, check your QoS settings too.  I don't run QoS."
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now","I have Fios with Google Wifi.  DTVN on Roku is garbage. YTTV, Fubo, Netflix & Prime Video have all worked perfectly fine."
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",I put up with it for way too long. It wasn’t any better on an AppleTV. Worked great on an iPad or an iPhone.
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",Yeah!  I even rebooted my Chromecast etc still not very good. I don’t get it. How is it good on an iPhone/iPad but bad streaming from a Chromecast that’s literally right next to the modem/router...
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",Trying out Hulu live. So far it’s much better than DTVN. Still buffers every now and again and we have 150mbps internet.  Guessing it could be my ancient Roku stick I’m trying to use. 😇. Seems to have a pretty identical channel list as YTTV but with the huge Hulu library behind it. Definitely interests me. 
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now",Has anyone had an issue with their Roku stick rebooting randomly while watching Hulu Live?  Maybe my device isn’t good enough to run Hulu live?  Any recommendations on Roku ‘s?  Did a quick Target/Hulu search and I’m seeing very few to none boxes looks like Roku is going with sticks only now?
"Well, I tried | Direct Tv Now","Well, I can’t even get DTNOW on my Roku. As for my gen 1 Chromecast it’s sitting right next to the wireless router so I can’t see why it would have any issues streaming.  I figure if I can stream ESPN through the ESPN APP flawlessly on my Chromecast I shouldn’t have too many problems with DTVNOW. Caveat I’m not an IT professional so take what I’m saying worth a grain of salt 😂😇"
Cord cutting set up - New to this,"Even though I’m not a big fan of the Apple ecosystem, sounds like you are on the right path. Only other thing you might look at, depending on what locals you are picking up on yttv is possible adding a OTA antenna. Depending on your location you might be surprised how many channels you can pick up, I can currently pick up 22. As for Comcast, yeah I cut them to internet only about 3 yrs back. Their tv sucked, constantly freezing and way over priced. Their internet on the other hand has been for me super reliable and stable I can count on one hand how many times I’ve had disruptions in the past 8 or so years other then weather related. "
Cord cutting set up - New to this,"Agree. With OTA, you even be able to consider something cheaper than YouTube TV."
Cord cutting set up - New to this,"that's a great suggestion to pick up an antenna, if I could get local channels - sports & news...I wouldn't even need Youtube TV - all i really want to be able to watch is local news & local NFL team"
Cord cutting set up - New to this,"60 down is good for one person.  If you have a household with others that will be streaming you might want to consider a bump in download speeds.  Otherwise, you are in good shape.  Definitely go antenna for over the air stuff.  You can get a good one for around $50 and they are easy to hook up.  For other channels, just check out the various streaming services to see what suits you best.  YOu may decide you don't even need that. "
Cord cutting set up - New to this,"Hulu TV throws in regular Hulu streaming for about $40 a month. So, you might be able to replace both Netflix & YTTV with it.If you already have Amazon Prime shipping, you already have Prime Video. If not, you may want to check it out, as it comes with several other benefits (music, free books, and such). Unless you are specifically subscribing for sports (ESPN), you may find an antenna fits your needs for live programming."
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,Best to get a Roku or a Firestick.
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,Yeah I would but I already have one hooked up to the other TV and my old one broke and I really would rather not spend more money on something when it was supposed to be included on that TV in the first place. But if their are zero work arounds I suppose ill have to.
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,This is why you never shop for a TV based on smart features. Processors are slow and app updates are few and far between.
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,I agree with you but unfortunately I had no say in the purchase of this TV :(
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,What’s more impressive is that you got a Vizio to last longer than a year!
Hulu no longer supporting my Vizio Tv,"Unfortunately, most streaming services tend to focus on streaming devices rather than smart tvs. There are just so many models each year that it becomes difficult to support all of them on each platform. [Here is the list of supported devices for hulu](https://help.hulu.com/en-us/supported-devices). Note that the $7.99 plan supports different ones than the live tv version. It says that the on demand version supports some Vizio tvs here: https://help.hulu.com/en-us/supported-vizioThere isn't a way to get an older version unfortunately. If the tv has a browser you could try the Hulu website in it or if it has the ability to cast, it might be possible to do that but that would not be as reliable as getting a Roku or another similar device.  "
Planning on cord cutting soon,"Not really that hard, buy an antenna and point it to 150degs - then try to use your existing cables. Hard part was just getting the cables close to your TV sets.The hard part is always the debugging when things don't work as planned. But at that point - you're no different than ""rest of us"". Struggling with experiments to ""get things back the way they wuz"" :)You can buy same product elsewhere, but these people have been a good source for multiple orders: http://www.dennysantennaservice.com/BTW, you will have problems with streamers if you don't provide a wired ethernet connection to each TV. Sorry....."
Planning on cord cutting soon,"Also, we're just looking at having strong LOCAL channels via the TVs with antennas.  We are planning on getting Hulu, Sling, etc. for anything beyond local network channels."
Planning on cord cutting soon,Do you know where the Spectrum signal comes into the house?  That's where you plug in the antenna and if the house is already wired you should be able to get signal from the wall outlets.  You might need an amplifier depending on the distance of the existing cable runs.
Planning on cord cutting soon,Ok. That helps me quite a bit. I think we can manage that. Thank you!
Multiple streams in multiple locations,"Yes. However, expect to be limited to mobile devices when streaming remotely. You cannot have someone watching Vue at home on ATV/Roku/PS4 while you are using a similar box in a different location. But you should be able to stream on a smartphone or tablet remotely. Availability of local networks is limited to the area you’re visiting, if available. You will not get your local ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox on the road, but you may get them for the area you’re visiting if the service has local coverage there. "
Multiple streams in multiple locations,Shoot. I was hoping to be able to travel with an Apple TV. Do you know if this would work with any of the other services?
Multiple streams in multiple locations,"We live rurally, so we maintain two networks in order to meet all of our needs. As a result, PSVue, Hulu Live, and DirecTV Now weren't options for us. They all require televisions to be on the same network. We ended up going with Sling. We can watch three different shows on different networks on different televisions at the same time. Since it works on our different networks, I assume it will work with traveling as well. It is worth looking in to further, especially with their one week free trial. "
Multiple streams in multiple locations,Yttv will allow this now. We are doing it with roku at our main house and second home. Roku does not report location so you get the home channels

"Cox increased rates, found more options for ISPs but I need help.","Fiber is the best internet you can get. It's speeds and reliability are unmatched to ancient cable. It's also usually cheaper and you get symmetrical internet. Meaning If you get 100mbps download you also get 100mbps upload. Upload speeds on cable are just embarrassing. AT&T has internet only plans just look on their site.Have you looked at slingtv? It has those channels for $25 a month. Look up also YouTube tv, hulu tv, Playstation vue and compare.

Can I use Dish coaxial cord from roof for OTA antennae?,"Yes, that should work fine. Try to eliminate any signal splitters that might have been installed along the way, if possible.

Can I use Dish coaxial cord from roof for OTA antennae?,"> Make sure to ground the antenna if you're installing on the roof.And if OP re-uses the same Dish Network mounting pole (like with an extender or gate post) -- and as long as that mounting pole was properly grounded by the original installer -- then that step is taken care of.The same goes for the grounding block for the coaxial, just before it enters the house./u/genocideofnoobs"

This is untrue.Think of it like this:* There are 10 5G networks deployed somewhere, in isolation.* Each one has a minimum speed, and a maximum (peak) speed.* The minimum speed is obviously 0; i.e., completely broken.* The *maximum* speed can be anywhere from 400 Mbps to whatever the theoretical maximum for 5G is.That last bullet point is what your sentence is saying.  Of the _possible maximum speeds_, 400 Mbps is the lowest _maximum speed_.  "
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,"unpopular opinion: you all have it wrong. The speed of fixed 5G is not what matters.... It's access and company reach.The barriers for entering a new region would be much much lower (no need to run cables, dig up streets, pay for permits to use poles). Consumes would have an unprecedented large amount of options and competitions in their area. Good bye ISP regional monopoly.Data caps might be a problem now, but as consumers get more ISP options thx to 5G... ISPs will be forced to become more competitive."
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,"I use Verizon wireless as my home internet and it is just as good as comcast was at my old house... although when I moved comcast still had the ""blast"" plan and 25 mbps was the limit.... so maybe I'm easily pleased...."
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,There is a fixed and limited amount of bandwidth available for 5G.
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,"More so than top speed, the difference will probably be in the latency.  It supposed to rival fiber IIRC, that's pretty awesome for any sort of real time communication."

Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,You should all look into [Starry](www.starry.com) 
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,The only way 5G is going to threaten wired providers is if the 5G guys are able to offer it with comparable data caps.  A 500Mbps 5G service with a data plan that throttles you down to 100Kbps after 10GB is not going to be very enticing as a general-purpose ISP plan.
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,"In Indy now and Comcast has a 1TB limit (that we have yet to hit more than 2/3rds of, with two people streaming and me working from home on huge datasets). We just got Fiber installed from AT&T to our apartment, but haven't switched. I think AT&T is rolling it out without data caps and at a higher speed for the first year, for around the same price I'm paying now. If 5g is half the price for half the speed but equivalent to what I get from Comcast now and no caps I would be all over it. "
Comcast and Charter Brace for Fixed 5G AT&T-Verizon Showdown in Indy,Farmers need this. Cities need fixed fiber.

Trying to cut FiOS,"Yep. They do not reward long time customers at all.If you live with someone, you might consider cancelling your service and having the other person sign up for new service."
Trying to cut FiOS,"I could definitely do that.I assume I would need to cancel existing service and have a period with no internet? If so, it’d be tough as I work from home. I could probably make it work for a day or so though.I could understand a small difference in new vs existing pricing - but  120% difference is insane.It’s crazy. :("
Trying to cut FiOS,"I was a triple play customer and dropped down to 75/75 internet only after my contract was up. It costs me $55 / month without renting the Quantum gateway (it was $65 with the gateway).  I am located in MA, north of Boston if it matters."
Trying to cut FiOS,Did you have to haggle at all for that? The rep I talked to was both useless and obstinate.I’d be willing to pay $55. (Don’t need their hardware...) I’ll try one more time after the holiday and see where I get. I’m in northern NJ - just outside NYC. So I imagine it would be similar pricing. 
Trying to cut FiOS,"I just went through the same exact thing as you. Was also offered the same exact pricing.Here's what they don't tell you...they don't know their ass from their elbow. Go online and order the internet as if you were a new customer. When it asks if there's service already to that address, choose the option about the current service holder moving out. Then, cancel your current account with the last day of service a day before the new account goes live.You don't even have to put it in someone else's name. I didn't. Just make sure you create a new username for the new account.I cancelled my bundle package and instead of 50/50 for $90, I got the promotional price on the new account for 100/100 at $40 ($53 with taxes and router rental). This was a week ago. "
Trying to cut FiOS,This seems like a good tactic - I will try this as well. I have no problem putting it in my wife's name though. So I have that option if needed.
Trying to cut FiOS,I switched from FIOS triple play to Optimum internet only back in March. Bill went from $127 to $51. 100 MBps plan now for 40 plus $10 for equipment rental plus tax = $51
Trying to cut FiOS,I had Optimum before FiOS and never had any real issues. I m not opposed to switching back if I can't get a decent rate.
Trying to cut FiOS,"Always loved my fios internet, reliable af. Those reps and prices sealed it for me. Cox sucks but it limps along and is 1 less headache."
Trying to cut FiOS,Seems like it's harder to reach a Fios rep vs Comcast 😂
Trying to cut FiOS,getting them to answer the phone is easy - getting an actual *answer* is not. :(
Trying to cut FiOS,Spectrum is pretty good
Trying to cut FiOS,"Optimum is fine, but more importantly you only have to keep it for a month or two before you can get new customer discounts from Verizon again if you don't like it."
Trying to cut FiOS,good point...
Trying to cut FiOS,You have to leave and come back or say your moving and put it in somebody else's name.
Trying to cut FiOS,I've been with Fios for nearly 10 years. Our triple play with 50/50 internet and a bunch of premium channels is $360/month.  New subscribers get the same package withbgigabit internet for $104/month. I live in Baltimore.  Not apples/apples because the $360 is loaded with tax and fees but i will not pay nearly triple for less features.  My wife and i are divorcing and fios is in her name.  They wont let her cancel and have me come on as a new subscriber.  I will likely go with comcast
Trying to cut FiOS,I just went through all this shit. Make sure final bill is paid and your account is canceled and closed out. Wait about a week. Then go online and sign up for the 3999 plan. That’s all I had to do. I had previously bought my own gateway router through Fios. So they didn’t even have to come to my house. After doing the order online my internet was back up and running in bout 45 minutes. Never talked to no reps or anything. 
Question about directvnow,"Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/9bq6ku/comparison_of_channels_and_webapps_credentials/) and [this page](https://help.directvnow.com/hc/en-us/articles/215395423-Watch-on-network-websites-and-mobile-apps-with-your-DIRECTV-NOW-account) what you are looking for? These are login credentials avaialable for DirecTV Now. Each network/cable tv app will have different content available using the login credentials. Some times it is live and other cases, it is on demand. For example, if one has the Hulu with Live TV streaming service, the CBS login credentials are only for live tv because CBS has its own service called CBS All Access. Another service might only have on demand content.(And yes, ESPN and Disney Now are on DirecTV Now's list)."
Question about directvnow,I think so. I've found PS Vue is supported by nearly all of them though. 
Question about directvnow,Essentially what I'm looking for is the best way to stream episodes of Nickelodeon shows like paw patrol and blaze and the monster machines for my kids because they aren't on the normal streaming methods
Question about directvnow,"You sure can!  Do note, you’ll more than likely have to click on “more providers” in whatever network-specific app you’re using (DIRECTV NOW is listed separately from the Satellite offering which typically appears up at the top of the list) - haven’t yet found a network which I get through DTVN that I cannot get access to in their own app (Nick Jr, Disney, even HBO GO if you pony up the competition-crushing $5 extra).  Damn, I sound like an ad (been a subscriber since the beginning - can’t say enough good things - and only one complaint about the one-time rate hike to $40 for the same package latecomers pay $60 for)"
No CBS on PS Vue = No NFL?,Try getting your local CBS station via antenna. Or sign up for CBS All Access if that doesn’t work. Note that CBS All Access is currently having a one month free trial if you sign up by 9/4 and use the promo code BINGENOW. 
No CBS on PS Vue = No NFL?,"If it's only one game for your team on CBS, use the CBS All Access free trial on that weekend. Make sure your local CBS is listed [here](https://cbsi.secure.force.com/CBSi/articles/FAQ/Where-is-Live-TV-available-for-CBS-All-Access) first.Alternatively, look into getting an antenna."
No CBS on PS Vue = No NFL?,"I use PSVUE but also hooked up a $20 over the air (OTA) antenna which gives me all my local channels including CBS, NBC, ABC, PBE etcLocal broadcast stations are now all HD.  This all works ok for me."
No CBS on PS Vue = No NFL?,"CBS is available in many markets on PS Vue but unfortunately some independent affiliates haven't signed agreements with the various streaming services yet. More are available on CBS All Access which is having a one month free trial for new subscribers. It typically has seven day free trials though. Or get an antenna. If tvfool.com thinks an indoor antenna is good for your location, try a winegard flatwave, winegard freevision or rabbit ear antenna with a loop. I recommend testing and setting up at least a few days or week in advance in case you need a larger attic or rooftop antenna."
No CBS on PS Vue = No NFL?,"Thanks. I'm in the Washington DC market but don't see CBS as an option when I look through the guide. I guess that means CBS is not available?I think I'll buy a cheap antenna and see how it works (I'm in a condo).Edit: actually, I just updated my post with an update. If CBS is WUSA in my market then I actually do have CBS."

Best setup for receiver/projector combo?,"Sorry, go to [this section](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/antenna#wiki_2._older_tvs_or_tvs_with_no_tuner). We have an updated link to the IView (we are working on the DVR Guide now). All three converter boxes - Mediasonic, Iview and Ematic AT103B Digital Converters Box are suitable.  Basically you are looking for a model that says it has a hdmi connector.  Most new ones do but older early models may not. I suggest buying from Walmart or items shipped and sold by Amazon for easy returns. For the DVR, see [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/dvr) although we are working on new draft right now. A converter box tends to be under $45 while a DVR is considerably more. DVR brands include Tablo TV, Channel Master, Tivo and Silcon Dust HDHomerun. Some require a subscription for a channel guide and some don't. Edit: Here is the [link to the current Iview Converter Box](https://www.walmart.com/ip/iView-3500STBII-Multi-Function-OTA-QAM-Digital-Converter-Set-Top-Box/38774646)."
Best setup for receiver/projector combo?,"We use a Tivo Premiere with lifetime service I bought off eBay. Its really the oldest and cheapest model worth buying; the Roamio and Bolt are newer, offer more tuners, but go for more $$$ on eBay. You want to make sure it supports OTA (some are cable card only), but I like ones that support OTA *and* cable card (because I don’t always cut the cord).If this dies, I probably go the home streaming route and switch to a HD Homerun of some sort. I had the iView for maybe a year before the Tivo and it handled tuning but guide info and faux DVR functions were pretty useless."
Best setup for receiver/projector combo?,How much did you spend on it? Looks like all the boxes are over 150 bucks.
Cutting the cord in the next few weeks. Need help with recommendations for streaming packages. (Sports junkies needed),"Definitely PlayStation Vue.

Cutting the cord in the next few weeks. Need help with recommendations for streaming packages. (Sports junkies needed),I use Vue core for sports and it works well for me. YTTV has the same stuff except NFL Network. Local sports channels and local network channels access can be a major determinant as some may not be available on a paticular service. The provider websites will let you know what's offered in your area and they have a free trial period so you can test drive. Good luck.

Best streaming option for me?,"Well truthfully for stuff like live sports even cable is 720p still.

Then congratulations, you've been walking around with a portable bug all this time. No, the special software you installed doesn't stop them from turning it on and listening whenever they want. They probably don't. They have no reason to. But it's not bug-proof by any means as long as it's tied into the cell phone towers and WiFi. Do you have a landline phone? That's an open microphone that the government or any telephone company can turn on at will. And they do, and they have been able to since the 1940s, and unless you're plotting to overthrow the government or unleash a terrorist attack on some public place, they don't give a shit about you. Do you walk around in public? Congratulations! Satellites can see you. My advice is to stop being paranoid and accept that we live in a connected society. Unless you want to live underground in the forests of Siberia, you're going to be seen, observed, heard, and even recorded. Learn to cope, or become like Ted Kaczynski.

DirectTV Now eating bandwidth on Roku,"Make sure you aren't leaving it open when you aren't watching it. That's an easy way to blow through data. If people in your house like leaving things on in the background you'll have to tell them to use OTA if you have that setup.Bandwidth caps on home connections are stupid, but they're an evil that some ISPs are forcing on people. One option is to switch to a lower speed plan. Not ideal, but ironically the best way to stave off the cap and save some money. Otherwise you'll have to find a different ISP if possible."

Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"I feel like the vast majority of people who haven't cut the cord haven't because of one or more of the following reasons:* Live sports or other things that aren't available via streaming (yet) - fairly low percentage I would guess* They reside in an area where internet is slow and / or unreliable - This is more areas than you'd think* Their provider makes it cost prohibitive to go to internet only service, as is my case. Xfinity gives me the triple play (TV / Phone / 100 mpbs) for the same price as 25 mbps internet would be by itself, so in essence, the TV and phone are bonus nachos behind a significantly better internet plan for the same money."
Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"Those 3 reasons are probably accurate for everyone who is seriously thinking of cutting the cord, but hasn't.  But probably the biggest reason is that there is still a gigantic base of people who have no interest in cutting the cord - they have discretionary income to invest in it, they like the convenience and setup of cable, older people who don't want to switch, etc.  "
Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"I'll add a fourth. For many, cord cutting can be a real hassle. Most of the time big-cable's setup just works and it is what people are used to. Push the button, watch my shows and wind down for the day. They don't need to choose services and figure out what show is on what app and keeping everything logged in and working."
Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"To your last point, your triple play contract is going to expire and at that point you're not going to get that introductory price.  That's how they get you in the door, knowing damn well that they are in it for the long haul.  Unless of course competition is available and you're willing to be a ""new customer"" every 2 years with a different provider.  I used to play this game for a while, eventually it got old and simply decided to stay with FIOS internet only.  Now every two years I reup my contract with them, for about the same price.  2 years ago I had 25 mbps for $50.  Now I just reupped 50 mbps (they no longer offer 25mbps) for the same $49.99 (no taxes)."
Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"I cut the cord on cable TV about 3 months ago. I had a lot of reservations because I have non-technical people in my family that don't want to have to think about things too much to sit down and watch TV. I also initially thought that the sports would be a problem, and that the cost savings weren't really there. I am on Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) and was getting a triple play package or whatever it is called (Cable, Phone, TV). I had two cable boxes and the cable tv part of my bill was around $100. I was getting mixed messages from how much I'd save when talking to customer service. A $5 price increase was the last straw so I began my journey into cutting the cord. Since my family doesn't watch TV much, the $100 cost was not worth it and everyone was OK with us trying out something different as long as our main channels were there.It took me a couple of days two narrow down to DirectTV Now or Youtube TV. I got the Apple TV for around $100 by signing up for 3 months of DirectTV now. I ended up canceling it and going with Youtube TV, because they had more channels that I watch, a great UI, and I like the DVR functionality. Direct TV Now didn't get local channels in my area, so that was a non-starter for me (I want local channels all on the same input without having to buy more devices or antennas). My current cable bill (Internet and Phone only) is $80 less after cutting my DVR and cable channels. Adding Youtube TV cost me $40 a month. So my net savings is around $40 a month and I have all the channels I need. I have a few other TV's and have Xboxes on those. The Youtube TV app on Xbox is really good. I also just recently bought a Roku Streaming + stick and spent $55 on it so I could watch football games down on my basement TV. As of now, I'm near break even for savings. I don't anticipate having to buy anything else for a while.I really like streaming, and won't ever go back to cable, but I do understand why people want to stick with it for now. Cable TV is indeed comfortable and easy. You don't need to do research, and it mostly ""just works"". You don't need to buy another device, add a new remote and input to toggle, or worry about device compatibility with your streaming service (in my case, I found out my Amazon Fire Stick wasn't compatible with Youtube TV). The problem I see with cable is the continued price increases, which are exacerbated by people cutting the cord- they are spreading the licensing fees to a declining customer base.Until someone produces a relatively inexpensive device that combines all services (local channels, other channels, streaming apps, etc.) and DVR capability into a super simple device, I don't see people leaving in droves. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with having something like this, because of all the licensing and content issues. You also need it to scale cheaply/efficiently to several TV's, and be SIMPLE to use and setup. Plex TV is probably the closest thing I know to this, but it requires an HD antenna, tuner, media server/hardware, DVR software setup, etc. Costs add up quickly and the complexity will limit broader adoption.

Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"One of the reasons my parents tossed around the ideas of bringing it back in their house is just the simplicity of watching. Turn on TV, press a button and your favorite channel is up and oh look, it's already playing something so you don't have to choose.While most of the time they just watch OTA stuff in the background when they're doing something else, they do miss Hallmark channel or Science channel and just being able to tune into those and just sit and watch and not have to scroll through an app and pick out a show or movie and cast it to the TV."
Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,I’m number 3. Have Comcast and it was the same price to have cable added.

Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,"Sports is going to be a tough nut to crack for companies like Netflix or Hulu...unless they are willing to give up on the ad-free model. Sports broadcasts are still HEAVILY subsidized by advertising. After all, it’s just about the only programming where networks can virtually guarantee ads are being seen. Last year Netflix had revenues of $11.6 billion.  NBC is paying $950M per year for NFL rights. ESPN is paying twice that amount. And that’s for licensing alone—add millions more in production costs. Netflix can’t afford to spend 10-20% of its revenues on about 80 hours of programming with little replay value. Think of all the mediocre scripted exclusives they could produce for a billion dollars!!! There are other, cheaper sports contracts available. But same rules apply—advertisers are currently covering a ton of the overhead. And Hulu is already losing money, so..."

Cord-Cutting: 71% Of U.S. Consumers Remain Loyal To The Cord,I wonder where that number would be if consumers had multiple options for cable and high speed internet.  Our choices are dictated by government policy and regulation.

California lawmakers pass toughest net neutrality law in the nation,"Pai did not propose any laws.  He rolled back a reclassification from the previous FCC that had changed them from Title I to Title II (which are Telecoms). Title II has requirements about not blocking access to things (so AT&T couldn't prevent you from calling someone on Verizon, for example).  Title I has no such restrictions.  So this law re-establishes those restrictions as well as preventing them from allowing some content to be exempt from their data caps (while other content isn't)."

How can i tell if sling tv offers local channels in my zip code,https://help.sling.com/en/support/solutions/articles/33000219213-how-do-local-channels-work-on-sling-tv-Select show my local channels in middle of page. (A good example is NY zip code 10001 which has locals).Fixed typo
How can i tell if sling tv offers local channels in my zip code,"Most probably it doesn't have your locals unless you live in NYC or LA or another megatropolis.  Also it doesn't have CBS or ABC in any location, so the best you can hope for is Fox and NBC (if you are lucky).  Sling isn't great, but its cheap.  DirectvNow has the biggest channel lineup of them all, and its well worth it. "
How can i tell if sling tv offers local channels in my zip code,"Sling gives me local Fox and NBC.  But they're not about giving broadcast basic cable service and tell customers to supplement with an antenna.  I use an antenna for that and rarely watch the locals on Sling.  HD OTA is great, uncompressed and no delay.If you're looking to recreate your cable line-up, there are other options that will cost you twice as much as Sling."
Univision,You may need a live tv streaming service. My current provider offers Univision. I have Fubo. You can use a Fubo account to sign into the Univision app as well. 
Univision,Is OTA an option?
Univision,"Fubo, Direct TV Now or you can sign up to the Univision Now app directly but I think that just gives you Univision and Unimas not the rest.  "
Univision,FuboTV's Latino package is the cheapest option at $18/mo.
Univision,You can get UnivisionNow. It's $7.99 a month and you get Univision and UniMas.
Univision,Thanks that's what I did. 
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,"It isn't worth it. I bought a Roku specifically for DTV Now a while ago because of the $10 per month promo they ran. It runs like garbage, to put it mildly. It freezes, loads slowly, and half the time it's missing channels."
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,But is that the hardware's fault?
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,Weird because I've been on DTV Now for a little over a week and have had virtually no issues. The only problem we had was that MSNBC was down for like 5 hours across their network one day but it's available for free on Pluto so we watched on there.The only issue I've had is that streaming is sucking bandwidth and I couldn't find a way to throttle it through the Roku.
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,Got this promo earlier this year and have had very few problems with Roku and DTVN. Worth it IMO.
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,"Fair warning, they give usually out devices refurbished by a third party. Got a fire stick from them about a year ago during a similar promo, and it was busted from the start. Only found out it was refurbished by a third party when I called Amazon for customer support "
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,"Not worth it IMO. Service sucks balls compared to YTTV. I'm not even a good fan, but I can't deny they did it the best out of anyone yet."
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,Doesn’t sling also offer Roku Express for free and Ultra for $50
Free Roku Streaming Stick subscribing to Directv Now,"Needed another roku, thanks for saving me $30 mate, may you have a wonderful day."
Best app / membership to just be able to watch nfl and epl games. Only thing that is keeping me from canceling. Don’t mind paying for a subscription,Vue or Fubo. They both have epl games and NFL RedZone. 
Best app / membership to just be able to watch nfl and epl games. Only thing that is keeping me from canceling. Don’t mind paying for a subscription,Vue.  Hands down
Best app / membership to just be able to watch nfl and epl games. Only thing that is keeping me from canceling. Don’t mind paying for a subscription,PS Vue and Fubo TV are good choices. See our [Live Streaming Services Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/live) to learn about both. 
Best app / membership to just be able to watch nfl and epl games. Only thing that is keeping me from canceling. Don’t mind paying for a subscription,"If you have Verizon as cell phone carrier (and are prepaid), live NFL games that you could get over an antenna (plus NFL Network and MNF games on ESPN) are free. That being said, you have to watch on your phone (they disable Chromecast)."
Best app / membership to just be able to watch nfl and epl games. Only thing that is keeping me from canceling. Don’t mind paying for a subscription,"I'm currently on my second EPL season with NBC Sports Gold. I have seen a lot of people complain about it but I have never had any problems. Last year though they wouldn't have a game here or there for some reason but I would bet that they had 90% of the matches on there. I don't watch the NFL too much but I have YouTube TV and they have a TON of college football, plus a few EPL and other leagues here and there."
"Yes, another: Recommend an anttena","I've just finished setting up my OTA and I'll try to help give you some advice. Hope it will be of some help.First, you should have no problem with CBS, NBC & ABC, they are all in the same general direction, slightly northwest of your location and they're 17-22 miles from your location to the transmitter. Your major problem is the Fox network, it's southwest of you at around 42 miles away.>You could get the first 3 with an indoor antenna. I have an $35 RCA with built in amplifier, rated for 55 miles but beware the mileage listed on all antennas are grossly exaggerated. Placement is everything, with me 6"" to the left drastically improved my signal. I actually believe I was in the middle of a wall stud. Many recommend a window but I would have to place it lower and after I tried it would come and go. Found out that the window screen will also interfere. I have an app on my phone that gives me signal strength of each station so I can really fine tune the position.  >  >Now, the real problem, FOX. You will definitely need a stronger antenna, possibly outdoor and as high as possible with an amp. You will also have to change the antenna direction whenever you want Fox, they make omni-directional antennas but the amount of difference in location is too great.  >  >If you want everything, my recommendation would be outdoor mounted above your roof line with a remote motor so you could change the direction of the antenna from inside the house. Make sure you use at least RG6 coax cable.  >  >Here's a link for some outdoor antenna advice:  >  >[https://www.gearhungry.com/best-outdoor-tv-antenna/](https://www.gearhungry.com/best-outdoor-tv-antenna/)  >  >FYI: All of the networks have sub-networks that you'll be able to receive, each of my 4 major networks have 3-4 subs, stuff like old tv shows etc. I get ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX &PBS but receive 18 stations if I count the sub channels. Good luck!!​"
"Yes, another: Recommend an anttena","You will definitely need an outdoor antenna aiming North. Because of terrain, you need to get it as high up as possible. "

ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,Hdhomerun has a premium service now if that helps.
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,I know but HDHomeRUn doesn't make any solutions for PCI or PCIE to go into a computer
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,No but the devices are not that big.I really can't think of a product off the top of my head.
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,I am not sure if I am understanding exactly what you want. Do you want a cable card tuner that will work with your current cable provider? If that is the case I would just buy a ceton infinitv 4 off of ebay and use that. You will still have to use a digital tuning adapter provided by your cable company externally hooked up via USB to your pc even then. 
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,I love the hauppauge quadHD and have been using it for a few years and thousands of recordings and it has never failed. This is a pcie OTA tuner.
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,"I used TV card in the past. The HDhomerun's I have are vastly superior in the fact that they run on the network, so anything can access them. There is no more microsoft dvr solution, so wanting a card is kinda pointless. "
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,"I'm not sure I understand your needs here. You want an HDHomeRun alternative, but not a tuner card?Perhaps it would help if you could tell us how you envision this all looking at the end. "
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,"no, I want a ""tuner card"" that isn't so expensive by me getting Tv through the brand i BUY IT FROM"
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,"Take 10 seconds and lookup the word ""Hauppauge"" that's the best you going to find."
ALTERNATIVE TO HDHOMERUN,"Thanks a lot, Found the USB dual TV tuner, that one seems helpful"
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"My suggestion would be to nab that 100 Mbps standalone internet deal for $40 from Verizon FiOS. That's a great price for that much speed. And then get your TV either by adding FiOS TV or doing what I do, get an Apple TV or other streaming box/stick and subscribe to whichever services you like. For on-demand video, there's Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, HBO, Showtime, Starz, CBS All Access and other. If you still want live ""cable TV,"" then there's DirecTV Now, YouTube TV, PS Vue, and Hulu with Live TV. Any which way you go, I'd think you'd still be paying less than the $185+ you were giving to Comcast. The other good thing about switching to FiOS for internet is that you will quality for ""new customer"" promo rates at Comcast again in six months. So stay with FiOS for a year or however long until their promo rates expire and then consider switching back to Comcast to get better rates there."
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"This is the right answer. Pay as little as you can for the right amount of speed. Unless you’re running multiple streams of 4k, 100mbps is great. Pick a live streaming service and a Netflix or Hulu type on demand service and enjoy it. Also benefit from the logins that a live streaming service gives, and get the apps for your favorite channels."
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"Comcast here also. Dropped down to internet only couple years ago (150mbs for 79.99 a month) . I use Nvidia Shields for my streaming boxes. Use OTA antenna for my locals. Use ttv for my on demand tv and movie viewing, and a live tv streaming service ($15 a month) for my live tv entertainment. All in I dropped from $214 a month to $95 a month. There are a lot of choices out there, do the research, find a platform you like, Android, roku, Apple. Far as I know all the major players have free trials, Hulu, PSV, YouTube etc. As for boxes, cheaper is not always better. Now this is just my personal opinion but I prefer a device I can plug a Ethernet cable into vs WiFi. What do plan on doing, just streaming, gaming, plex server, full on entertainment system. Take your time, be open to the new setup. "
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,I'm debating should I try to get a better deal from Comcast or take the FIOS deal and switch ISPs. Thanks for info. I would probably go Apple TV (I'm already deep in their ecosystem) and Vue.
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"The fios deal is better and it’s fiber, unlike Comcast. Dump Comcast. You can sign up for streaming service for video. "
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,Funny Spectrum offered me a promo rate on internet when I turned in my cable box.  Quit wasting time with comcast and do the Verizon $39.99/100 deal then next year you can get new customer pricing on comcast. 
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,r/comcast_xfinity will help you
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"Try calling Comcast again. If they don't budge, just hang up and call back. You'll likely get a different sales rep. Another tip is to use a roommate or spouse's name/phone number/email when calling sales. They'll be able to get new customer pricing (I think you have to wait 3 months until Comcast considers you to be a ""new customer""). If you still pay Comcast for anything, then call and get to the ""retention"" department (in my experience, you have to tell them you're canceling). Those folks seem to be able to give you the best deal."
Handed in Cable Box to Comcast Today/Question,"2 things :1. Like someone else here suggested, call Comcast & cancel altogether.  They HAVE to put you through to their retention person, who will come up with an offer to get your attention.2.  Put Xfinity or Comcast in a browser search box.  Several sites come up, many seem to be Xfinity offshoots that can make offers to you that even Xfinity can't  (or won't)."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",No I would not.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","Not just no, but fuck no. I don't want to be trying to figure out how much I've paid for TV shows during the month. That sounds like a giant pain in the ass."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","You wouldn't have to do anything. A system would calculate in the background at a set rate of say $.15 -$.30 per hour. Based on the average comsumption, your costs would be say $40/month and you can watch what you want in one app."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",I probably would. I Basically only watch sports and a couple tv shows that are OTA. There are a handful of shows that pop up once in a while that I'd like to watch when they air or have access to like when Breaking Bad was on or Fargo etc. that I'd happily pay 50 cents for.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","I just wish channels would let you purchase subscriptions directly. Basically like how they ask you to login to your cable provider online, but had an option to login to your account with the channel/network. There's a few channels that I would gladly pay $5/month instead of paying $60+ to watch 4 channels and 400 infomercials."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","By the hour, no.However I think more services should offer more options to their pricing structures.   A good example of this is how the NBA League pass is offering $0.99 streams for just the 4th quarter of games on top of all the pricing options they currently have.  Sky Sports in the UK offers a one day pass to all their sports channels.Imagine if any of the big networks offered a $5.00 option for one day to buy a stream for big events (Superbowl. Oscars. Emmys, Olympics etc) This would be great for binge watchers as well of traditional shows.In fact they could offer a dual subscription rate as well one that is lower priced with commercials and one that is higher priced without commercials. This would allow the networks to better monetize the content and give advertisers more insight into the digital inventory.    The other option is for existing TV Everywhere apps say like History that give you access to all seasons of a show with a cable subscription to offer seasons passes to purchase or rent shows that they produce directly from their apps."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","Agree. As for the hourly rate suggedtion., I'm talking $0.15 -$0.30 per hour consumed, anything in one app. "
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","In general, no.  I want to know how much I’m paying per month ahead of time.  But if it were an option, I might use it on occasion, just as I might use VOD/redbox."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","That would work. Amazon is offering something similar, but doubtful the type of channels you are looking for. "
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",I already do. Between 1-2 cents an hour for each of my streaming services. 
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",If your talking your subscription fees based on what you watch. But wouldn't it be nice to have it all on on service at the same price per hour? The option to watch that one show you'd have to spring for another service today? That's kinda what I was shooting for.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",The issue I have with it is paying the same to have an old show stream in the back ground as I do for new original content I’m watching intently. I agree some new pricing options would be welcome. Maybe a base access fee and an hourly rate for premium content or something. Maybe a light version with limited hours per month versus a full version. Right now I have 5 services I’m paying for. I intend to cancel a couple soon as the shows I wanted are done but I’m not using the others as much but it’s annoying to cancel and subscribe to everything all the time. I don’t see Netflix changing its model as it tries to be a full service company but maybe a lower tier service with limited premium content would do it to lower the barrier to entry and entice customers with a passing interest in niche content. 
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",Never
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","Absolutely not. Unless it's really fucking cheap, like 25 cents an hour or something. Or if it was a kind of package you could get on Google Play Movies and TV that I could add to what I already have. I prefer more the all you can eat subscriptions that Netflix, Amazon offer. "
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",No.  Imagine the crapfest that would become in a few years after the companies figure out how to game the system.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","Not with the way I fall asleep when watching! Charged for napping through my shows, nope. "
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","I wouldn't mind paying for blocks of TV programming, pay-per-view style. The problem is I don't want to pay for ads. Live TV is really the only thing you can't legally get elsewhere on a per-event basis. I can buy movies and shows, but not sporting events."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","For $40, I could just get YouTube Live, Sling, Cue, etc and have unlimited watching."
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",Limited choice though.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","How about a little vending box next to the TV, kind of like a Magaic Fingers at cheap motels?  Put a quarter in and I get an hour of TV.  The cable guy could come around once a month and collect the quarters.  I can take off work one day a month and wait for him.  I bet you loved AOL in 1994.  "
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",I did.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",Sure.  If it was dirt cheap.
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?",No. Some days/months I watch more TV than others. Sounds like a pain in the ass. 
"Would you be willing to pay an hourly rate to view what you want, when you want?","Sure would. I've always hated the idea that my (former) cable bill paid for channels I never watched. Now as a new cutter, I missed not having College Gameday today, but typically only watch it 5 or 6 times per year. I gladly would have ponied up a few coins for live tv as desired. "

Is 20 Mbps Enough?,"Should be enough generally, if you’re doing one or two screens at 720-1080.  Other resolutions YMMV.  And since it’s cellular, speeds may fluctuate "
Is 20 Mbps Enough?,Yea at most there would be 2 streams. Or 1 stream and PS4 gaming. Speeds fluctuate somewhat but never seen them go below 12 Mbps. However like I said the problem could be the Velocity hotspot that doesn’t get good speeds compare to my iPhone. How can I maximum the speed?
Is 20 Mbps Enough?,"You’d need a new hotspot, there isn’t really anything you can do to make a devices speed any faster in this case. "
Is 20 Mbps Enough?,"I often live with 2.5Mbps, so 6-20Mbps is plenty."
Is 20 Mbps Enough?,"We live in a rural subdivision, 9mbps is best we can get. I didnt think it would work, but it does. Though not always in high def. So 20 mbps you'll be fine"

Any Cost Effective Solution to Get NBC Sports Philadelphia?,"Check the websites of live tv streaming providers. They usually allow you to see what RSNs you can get. Try checking Vue, Fubo, and YouTube TV. You can use your subscription to sign into tv network apps for sports (Fox Sports Go, NBCSN, etc.) and shows/movies (FX Now, etc.). "
Any Cost Effective Solution to Get NBC Sports Philadelphia?,Ok thanks! With that solution it looks like we might have to give up DTTV because adding let’s say YouTube TV wouldn’t be cost effective. 
Any Cost Effective Solution to Get NBC Sports Philadelphia?,PSVue Core Tier has it. 
Any Cost Effective Solution to Get NBC Sports Philadelphia?,Thanks. We will need to have Discovery and History channels.

How does PSVue determine your location?,They use IP location
How does PSVue determine your location?,Dammit. Thanks. 
How does PSVue determine your location?,"yes and no, I lived in Alaska when the service started. Moved to Florida at the beginning of this year and Sony thought i was just on vacation for 6 months. After that amount of time they finally told me to cut it out and change my account information by shutting the service off. I verified my new location and it came back on."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"1. Netflix doesn't make you pay more to skip commercials2. While it's just my opinion, Netflix has better original content.3. Hulu's UI makes me want to jab a spork into my eyes."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Netflix and Hulu now have the same cost for their premium offering. Hulu just has a cheaper version with ads. And it’s actually more popular than the ad free version as of now
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I’m not a fan of Hulu’s UI, but it’s hands down better than autoplaying previews on Netflix. Fuck that - not worth it to me. I buy Netflix for one or two months out of the year, mostly because I can’t stand the autoplaying. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Hulu gives you a discount for accepting commercials :)
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,I honestly can't believe they stuck with that fucked up UI.   It's a god damn mess. 
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Why a spork? 🤔
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Pretty much. Hulu I have to pay for and get ads, and pay more for to get rid of ads. Neither is perfect for content but one of the main reasons I dont have cable is because A) it cost a fortune B) there are loads of ads on it. Hulu is cable TV over the internet. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Because they were first. But the consensus, domestically, is starting to change. Netflix will be good to subscribe to a month or 2 to catch up on their shows, but Hulu will be better for year round subscription. I’m hoping Disney and Comcast both keep their stakes in Hulu so it gets the most content possible. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Yeah, that's a good point. I hadn't thought of that. I purchased them both relatively recently, so I'd forgotten.But just for clarity, does Hulu take shows off?"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"By the sounds of it, for Disney anyway, they are going to pull most of their content off everything for their own streaming platform. I heard it's going to start out at 6$ a month to pull in as many subs as possible. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"This is what my wife and i switched to, we keep hulu and youtube tv year round Nd sub netflix when our shows have new episodes"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Netflix and Hulu are more complementary services, vs alternatives. Different services, serving different purposes.Both services add and remove shows over time. Both have originals.Hulu is *mainly* a Live TV / Live TV VOD replacement, with an aditional VOD backlog of older shows, and *some* movies. Also, no other service provides shows the day after they air, with a no-commercial option.Netflix has a deeper catalog of movies and TV shows. They do not have new episodes of shows that are currently airing like Hulu. No commercials."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I used Hulu when they first started up (2007 I think?). At first they were selling themselves as 'not like cable - no commercials!' And it was great. Obviously, that couldn't last so they added a commercial at the beginning of a video. Fine, OK. Then they went to multiple ad breaks of one ad during a video, and they said that would be it. *sigh* OK, it's still better than cable. Then they added the paid subscription which was supposed to be ad-free (after previously saying that the service would always be free). At the same time the ad breaks went from one to minimum of three ads during a break. The ads went from 5-10 seconds long to 30+. Then the paid subscription had ads too, just fewer of them (for a time there was no ad-free option).All of this progressed over a period of about two years, with constant promises that the advertising levels would not be increased which would then be broken in a month or two. The constant devolvement of the quality of the service got tiresome and started to look malicious. Basically, they created a user base and then started exploiting them as greedily as they felt they could get away with. Personally, that kind of behavior pushed me away from the service. Netflix never treated their customer base in such a way."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I think a lot is due to ""history"".  At one time, if you wanted ""popular movies"", you went to Netflix.  Back then Hulu was problematic even the rare times it did have a popular movie (which wasn't often).Today, if TV is your ""thing""... Hulu  and now, Netflix is pretty much all about their original content.  Eventually all ""good"" Marvel and of course all Disney will leave Netflix along with most Star Wars, etc... Netflix is setting themselves up for the next big ""cut"".  In many ways not terribly different from old school HBO or Showtime.  Just my opinion of course."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Seems many actually do not like to actually hate Netflix as of late by most of the threads on this sub. That said I do not and have not had Hulu. I don’t really miss the old tv shows or the things that were put out by networks. Personally I enjoy Netflix content for the most part. I won’t say everything is awesome but I’ve gotten immersed in many series and movies from them. Even some of the foreign series have been great, like Dark, I just use the CC option. To be honest I keep that on all the time now even for English shows/movies. Some of them can have some strong accents that make having it on nice to know for sure what was said otherwise I can easily ignore it. I’ll admit that finding something new to watch can be daunting because 1. There is so much I see that I may like and 2. The different genre selections and menu set up make it hard to search and don’t even show you everything they have available, it’s based off each profile. But again I’ve enjoyed it for how cheap it is. For me I haven’t had a reason to want Hulu to watch shows from the networks that seem blah to me now. Hulu may have some of its own content but for now I’m content. Just my two cents"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,The UI of Hulu is hot garbage. It is better for current season of tv shows yes but sometimes Back catalogs are nowhere to be seen and sometimes seems random with which seasons are and aren’t available 
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,True
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,not paying for ads.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Netflix and Hulu ad free is the same price now though.  Hulus ad service is cheaper than Netflix's cheapest option.  
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"We have hulu and amazon prime, and we have access to a shared Netflix account.  I use Netflix the least often of them.  Hulu is my go-to for new stuff.  I don't get several broadcast channels OTA (ABC for instance doesn't pick up here) so I use it to watch new broadcast stuff.  I haven't enjoyed most of the Netflix originals I've seen, and the other stuff is available via the other two platforms."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,User interface Netflix > Everything else.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,I always get buffering on Hulu but their commercials NEVER buffer.  I don't ever encounter buffering issues on Netflix. 
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Odd. I do notice however, that when i'm watching something over an hour, the resolution stays at it's lowest for some time before cleaning up. This only happens to me on Hulu.Netflix has some connectivity issues, but it never has problems with resolution."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"For me Hulu is the better one. Thet get more of the Anime I like, have the Steven Spielberg cartoons from the 90's and offer up newer shows quicker then Netflix. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"For me, it’s because Hulu is more expensive and produces less quality content, is relentless with ads, and all it seems to have are shitty day time sit coms which have been irrelevant since like the 90s.  I don’t really care about watching Big Bang theory and reality show trash."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Fair enough, although it's only more expensive if you buy the highest quality package."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Hulu has crap audio and video quality.  I can watch Netflix in Dolby 5.1 surround where Hulu is only stereo. Netflix also has a lot of shows in 4K and even HDR.  If you are watching in a home theater setting Netflix is much more enjoyable. Hulu’s app has a horrible interface, apparently nobody there understands how menus work.  Unfortunately Netflix is going out of their way to make their app more obnoxious and shitty so it’s advantages are shrinking. I subscribe to both but I watch much more content on Netflix.  If Hulu had a lot more current seasons of shows instead of just back catalog it would more appealing. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Netflix has far more and better original content than Hulu does. Handmaid's Tale and Castle Rock are both very good, but it kinda falls off a cliff after that from average to bad. That said, I'm now 'forced' to maintain a Hulu subscription year round for quick access to Family Guy, Rick & Morty, and South Park."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I see you, but Harlets is one of my favorite things to watch right now. And while not OC, I think Hulu played a major part in saving Brooklyn 99 because that is where most people watched the show. So I don't think you can discount the value of the other content that each platform has."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,FYI every South Park episode is available for free on their website.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Because I live in the UK
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Bingo. While the selection in my countries suck, at least Netflix exists.Everything else I can just download."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Hulu also has some content come and go, it's all about distrobution rights. It's more up to those who are selling them than those who pay for them. Netflix would gladly keep everything they could (unless not a lot of people watched it) but it's just not up to them most of the time. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I actually prefer YouTube because it is free, and AdBlock works on it unlike Hulu's free service.As far as Netflix is concerned, I just got that for my elderly father. The way Netflix bubbles people, and never gives them an actual list of EVERYTHING available has made me stay away from it.I usually only watch Documentaries anyway. YouTube has provided me with something new to watch on a daily basis for the last few years. Even then I only watch them to help me go to sleep at night.Video games have taking this 48 year old away from the curse of television. I highly recommend trying some immersive video-games. If someone had a knife to my throat and forced me to choose. I think I would have chosen Netflix > Hulu. There was simply more content the last time I checked."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,>Video games have taking this 48 year old away from the curse of television. I highly recommend trying some immersive video-games.What video games would you recommend?
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Not really a fair comparison. YouTube makes you pay for individual movies. If you watch a t.v. show, you have to buy each season individually and it ends up being far more expensive.I love YouTube, but I don't really find it to be very comparable to Hulu."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"For me, it's all about their Marvel lineup of shows.  (That said, I also have free Hulu with my Sprint account)&#x200B;/Yeah, I'm on Sprint.  Fight me."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Hulu's new UI is horse shit.   Netflix also has more I want to watch. 
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Fair enough. Don't agree.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Netflix on Roku will warn me a few weeks out when a shows licenses is set to expire. Sometimes after a license expires and the rights holder seeks other venues they will return to Netflix. I imagine they don't like to make a bigger effort to advertise when a show is leaving because if a following were to say ""Netflix you MUST keep my show or I'll ...!"" it would hurt them at the negotiating table. That said a license expiration is publicaly available information. When I cared more about trying to watch everything before it expired I would go to [the 'Leaving Soon' section of whats-on-netflix.com](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/)Hulu will have a **LOT** of problems in its future. An FCC stipulation of the NBC Universal and Comcast merger required (for 7 years after Comcast acquired NBCUniversal in 2011) not to exercise any right to influence the conduct or operation of Hulu. That clause just ended so who knows whats going to happen next.Disney is [starting its own competing service](https://variety.com/2018/film/news/disney-streaming-service-2019-1202898412/) and despite what anyone here claims we really have no idea what the final product will offer but looking at [this chart of Disney holdings](https://www.titlemax.com/media/every-company-disney-owns-13_pageversion.jpg) if they did an inclusive bundle or more likely tiers like the classic cable model then to say the new offering would be disruptive would be an understatement. So who knows whats going to happen next.* Back from dead laptop batteryI didn't expect to start writing so much I guess what I wanted to point out is that Hulu wasn't built to rival Netflix, it was made as an alternative to the unlicensed Youtube uploads and Jason Kilar, the early CEO helmed the company to so successfully that early rumors suggested partners regretted merging and they wanted more independent control of their respective content and in light of recent events we should expect changes at Hulu in the coming year.I say this because wonky interface aside (let's be honest the Amazon Video Marketplace/ Prime Video is its own slice of confusing UI) I like Hulu as it currently is, but caution fandom in the face of looming disaster.And I think Netflix is on the right track [growing its original content.](https://www.howtogeek.com/fyi/over-half-of-new-netflix-content-next-month-is-original/)"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Yeah, I have Netflix on my consoles and it never warns me.I hope Hulu stays strong. I honestly kinda despise Disney nowI don't mind you writing so much, this is all fascinating."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I alternate between them and actually give more money to Hulu, but Netflix has a lot more subscribers. Here are some factors that could be making a difference:* Netflix is worldwide, but Hulu is limited to the USA.* Netflix has lots more original content.* Netflix has all the shows from CW, which is the network I watch the most shows on, and Hulu doesn't air CW shows anymore.* Netflix has been commercial-free from the beginning, while Hulu has only recently offered a commercial free package.* Netflix is cheaper than commercial-free Hulu.* Hulu competes directly with TV, because it focuses on streaming the latest episodes of current TV shows, whereas Netflix supplements TV by letting you binge past seasons of shows that you can no longer find on TV.BTW, Netflix does inform you of when shows are leaving ahead of time. Whenever I resubscribe to Netflix, I check my list to see which shows on it are leaving soon. Also, when I recently watched an episode of InuYasha, it showed me a notice that it was leaving soon. Since it looks like that show has now been renewed and is not leaving, I put Batman Begins in my list, which is scheduled to leave tomorrow. My list says ""Available Until 9/1/2018"", but when I started the movie, it did not give me any further notice that it will be leaving. However, it doesn't inform you when you are browsing through recommended content. I tried this again with Iris, a Korean drama that is scheduled to leave on September 24, but it didn't inform me of it leaving. I don't know if this means that Netflix informs me only about shows and movies that are leaving soon or that it has been renewed. Anyway, you can also find out about what's leaving soon by searching the web for articles on what's leaving Netflix in the current or upcoming month."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Thanks for the information. Those are all very good points that I hadn't considered/didn't know. As for when they take Netflix shows off, I also have noticed something happen quite frequently, but maybe it's some kind of glitch. I'll see that a show is on Netflix, and decide I want to watch it later. I'll search it up a few days after, and I won't find it. Then as i'm browsing the Home, i'll find the show I was looking for on there. Wtf?And yeah, that's usually how I find out shows are being removed is from online articles."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,The idea behind each was very different.  Netflix started online to provide a supplement that addressed a user complaint about the service. Waiting for the next DVDs to arrive and then as it grew and studios wanted more of the action they started creating their own content to reduce their dependence on outsiders.  Hulu had a vision of being your DVR. Last night's shows available on demand with unskippable commercials along with the back library at a low price.  If you had cable or satellite you probably had a DVR so Hulu didn't offer as much useful content.  Both have changed their visions and Hulu is a better product than it once was but perceptions linger.&#x200B;
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,I use both. Each have unique offerings. Netflix is better for movies and binge watching TV shows. Hulu is better for current shows on TV.  
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Movies definitely. Especially the exclusives. Some of the best movies i've seen all year were direct to Netflix. Stranger Things is also amazing.Yeah, Hulu actually has every season to every series. Something that Netflix has trouble with."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"CONTENT and UII did a trial of Hulu, couldn't find anything I was interested in watching and finding something I might be interested in wasn't easy."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I may be biased here. A lot of the shows that I currently watch on Hulu are shows that I used to watch on Netflix that got taken off. Because of the removal, I became increasingly disillusioned with the service."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"People complain about the commercials on Hulu.  Even with the no commercial package, there are like 5 shows that make you watch an ad before each episode.  I've had HULU for a couple of years now, and have never found those shows.  People make a big stink about that.  Netflix does have the better original series, but I watch Hulu more than I watch Netflix.  It's a pretty solid library."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I wasn't aware of this. The library has all the same things that Netflix has, it just keeps it on there for longer. I've never encountered ads before ever. What shows are commercialized?"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"It's those gross, pastel colors and the shitty navigation. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Yeah, it is pretty ugly. Shitty navigation, I don't really know what you mean. I've never had difficulty finding a show to watch. Could you elaborate?"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"I have both, and lately we've been watching a lot of stuff on Hulu. I was using Hulu w/ Live TV for a few months and recently cancelled because my wife and I rarely watch live TV, so it was a waste. [Spotify has a deal](https://support.spotify.com/us/account_payment_help/subscription_information/premium-and-hulu/) where you get Spotify Premium and Hulu w/ Limited Commercials for $12.99. Sadly you can't upgrade and remove the commercials with this plan."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,hulu is better for finding not original tv content.  netflix is better for finding original content.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Less ClickingSkip IntrosEasy to go to the next show in the series. Easier to browse content
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,It's far from a either or scenario.  The more the merrier
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,* Video quality* Audio quality* Original content* Lack of commercials
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Hulu doesn't have commercials if you buy the 12 dollar package. Why do I have to explain this over and over lol
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,My use case:* get home after a long day of work* turn on netflix* continue working on personal projects while netflix autoplays in the backgroundNetflix is basically on the level of radio for me. I could listen to podcasts or the actual radio instead but sometimes I want something visual going on to break the monotony. Hulu doesn't offer anything that I want or need over the experience that Netflix does so I stick to Netflix.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Netflix offering is just vastly superior, no commercials..and if you don't take time to research when shows drop out, it's your own fault"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"When talking about Netflix's offering, that's obviously subjective, so i'll give you that one. However, making a stink about Hulu's commercials is moot. It only has ads if you pay for the cheapest package. The ad-free package is the same price as Netflix. Also, are you honestly suggesting that it's my fault that I don't watch a show in time when Netflix has hundreds of T.V. shows?"
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Not paying a subscription for commercials.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Hulu website and overall interface sucks
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,No commercials is why I don’t watch Hulu. I have it so my wife can watch a few shows and that sit. 
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Hulu doesn't have commercials if you buy the second most expensive package, which is still around the same price as Netflix."
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Hulu. They got urkel.
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,Ha! Fuck everything else!
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,"Honestly, my SO and I prefer Hulu to Netflix. We have and enjoy both, but with Hulu now offering typical tv channels (essential because I MUST watch Ellen), we find ourselves using that platform more for binging shows too. "
Why is Netflix preferred over Hulu,I get hulu for free so I'm only paying for netflix.
Streaming NFL on Verizon mobile,"They no longer have exclusive mobile rights but they are restricted to phones and tablets. In the past, casting, AirPlay or HDMI cable were blocked because Verizon only has had mobile rights.

Streaming NFL on Verizon mobile,"I asked on twitter....reply from Verizon Wireless:Hi!

Streaming NFL on Verizon mobile,Thanks for info! Looks like I'll be streaming redzone on my phone while I watch whatever I'm market games I get.

YouTube TV Commercials,"The amount of commercials with Live TV for all the streaming services are identical to cable/sat.If you referring to VOD, that’s similar as well. When you DVR shows, you can fast forward with Hulu’s Enhanced DVR add-on (worth it).With YTTV, most DVR’d shows flip to VOD with forced commercials. This is a big negative against YTTV."
YouTube TV Commercials,[deleted]
YouTube TV Commercials,I played suits through the DVR and I had to sit through it t. Do I have to record in a different way?
YouTube TV Commercials,What people always seem to forget to mention is that if you want that commercial free option with Hulu you must pay more. Lets not pretend that YTTV is at a disadvantage when you get the same exact service on Hulu for the same money. The only real difference is that YTTV doesn't have a more expensive commercial free option.
YouTube TV Commercials,"Hulu Live does not have a ""commercial free"" option.  It's live tv, that wouldn't be possible."
YouTube TV Commercials,You might be a good candidate for the new HDHR streaming service so you can roll your own DVR with no restrictions.   I mostly use YTTV for cable news so don’t run into VOD very often and use HDHR/Plex for OTA shows I may watch later. 
YouTube TV Commercials,If Hulu live offered all local channels in Seattle I might switch and do the enhanced dvr stuff. 
YouTube TV Commercials,"I have found the commercials have actually gone way down. It used to take me about 57-58 minutes to watch an hour show VOD. For about the past month, it’s been closer to 46 minutes."

"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","After cutting the cord a couple years ago, I dropped from $214 a month to $95 a month all in and get tons more content and better experience then I ever did with cable tv. "
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",Cool.8 years ago I went from $160 with 2 DVRs to $29 internet only.
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",Writer lost me at adding the price of the internet to price of streaming services.
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",Yeah why the fuck does everyone think it's ok to just roll the price of your internet into your cord cutting bill? As if most people wouldn't have internet anyway even if they kept their cable. 
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","A cost I never see mentioned is the cost to run cable boxes 24/7.  From Optimum's website I was able to find out how much electricity the boxes used.  Based on my local rates, the 3 boxes cost $60 a year just to be there, and used more when showing programs.  Since I dropped them 2 1/2 years ago, that's $150 back to me.  My Rokus do not use anything close to that in electricity.  Another bonus is I don't have to have those boxes cluttering up rooms.  And I've readjusted to having a clock."
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","That's a good point on the extra electricity cost savings with 3 or more cable box power hogs.  I actually use the Roku sticks plugged into USB ports on my TVs for power, so that costs me next to nothing."
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",I am saving $100 a month and that's after adding on basic Hulu and Youtube premium.&#x200B;Cutting the cord was ONLY about SAVING MONEY
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","YMMV, but I'm paying $47/month for Netflix, (ad-free) Hulu, HBO Now, and Showtime. That's less than the [$106/month](https://www.leichtmanresearch.com/79-of-tv-households-subscribe-to-a-pay-tv-service/) for pay TV. "
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","Technically I spend more because I never had cable but when I started shopping around to get the channels I wanted all my traditional options sucked.

"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","I am saving $140/month and watch almost all the same content, so the OP is pretty wrong to start with"
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",Fellow cord cutter here. Save about 50 bucks a month. I’m realistic though in that the cable company still owns the pipe to my house and they can jack the rate up of internet service anytime they want and there is nothing I can do about it but pay up or cut internet. And they know that is not going to happen. So I will enjoy the savings now knowing it won’t last. 
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","Some of you saying you’re saving $100+ a month with the same content were really getting bent over by your cable provider. Don’t get me wrong, that’s a great savings but it should never have been that high to begin with. Did you guys just not call to ask for promos?"
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","That's part of the problem and why many of us cut cable.  Loyal customers should not be penalized.   I was very good at the annual renegotiation, but it shouldn't be needed."
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience",You shouldn't have to negotiate with your cable company for a reasonable rate. Why are you OK with that?
"Cutting the cord may not save you money, but it is a way better TV experience","I'm sure if I chased my provider every few months and threatened to leave, it could be less, but I shouldn't have to.  The equipment rental fees and DVR fees from Dish we're about $30 a month for years.  On PS Vue now and bought my own equipment (Amazon Fire).  No more BS fees for hopper, joey and all that.  Also a huge savings is the ability to turn off premium channels like HBO when the shows I like to watch are no longer playing current seasons.  I'll turn HBO back on when GOT comes back next year."

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"I was just speaking with someone about how Netflix’s original content use to be top shelf (House of Cards, OITNB, etc.). Now they produce so much, most of it is crap. Makes it a bit exhausting to search through all of it to find the gems. "

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"I'm not 100% sure on that. House of Cards S1 wasn't THAT high caliber- aside from the 8th or 9th episode at Sentinel- but it was well-produced and had some great acting, but it was leagues better than Netflix's *actual* first Netflix Original, Lilyhammer. They also have more money to throw stuff around, because not everyone is interested in watching Female Shawshank (*you know what I mean*) or Kevin Spacey Doing Nasty Things (*pre-coming out as a molester*). As a result Netflix is throwing around a ton of money designed to touch many a person, like Silly Stupid Comedies (there are at least three Adam Sandler Netflix movies), Super Serious Dramas (Beast of No Nation for instance), Anime Designed to Appeal to 90s Guys (AICO, the Whales one), and food-based reality shows (*including one from Japan!*). But it is really, really hard to make/distribute hundreds of shows without losing a bit of quality control; the days when you could count Netflix shows on one hand are long gone, and it's much harder to keep Daredevil S2 to the standards of Daredevil S1 when you already have three or more Marvel shows in the dock.Still, it DOES mean Netflix is rarely the source of my show recommendation, so there's that >_>."

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"I think that is why they got rid of the ratings. People would rate things like documentaries high, but never watch them.

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"But... it's not.  You have options.  Shitloads of options.  Pay a fairly reasonable price for the ones you want, and save money by not paying for the ones you don't.  Even if you do subscribe to all three you mentioned, you're still only paying ~$30/month, and getting a whole hell of a lot of **on demand** content.  I really don't understand what you're complaining about.  You discovered you don't like anything on netflix, then complain you have to pay for it to watch all the shows you like?  Just don't pay for Netflix, and stick with Hulu.  What's the problem?"
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Yea but isn’t Netflix putting ads for their own content? 
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Except for the part where it's not cable. Except that part. 
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,[deleted]
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,I definitely like Hulu the best especially for $13 for it and Spotify. Never watch on Freeform app if you don't want to only see ads for their content. I'd rather watch ads for most products as long as it's not some super annoying one.
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Unless they do something like skip add button down the bottom like the skip intro button. That would be okay with me
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Netflix is caca and more and more people are realizing it. I'd rather buy dollar DVDs at the thrift store and actually get some quality content.

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"No, I watch and enjoy a lot of their original content, especially the foreign stuff and documentaries. My TV viewing these days is less, but the quality is much greater. I'm excited for Roma too. Sacred Games has been good as well."

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"There's a lot of crap original content, but there's a lot of good stuff too. Even some of the crap is fun if it fits your niche. I've binged several Netflix shows in the last year and enjoyed them.I just wish their non-original content was as good as it was 5+ years ago. It seems like there aren't any good streaming services for decent movies any more. They just cycle the same couple dozen decent flicks over and over again."
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,"I personally like the foreign options! And it's fun playing around with the dub settings too :D.That said, Netflix has a tendency to order a bunch of...*interesting*...content from its English production studios and such, so I can imagine that those of us who aren't watching That Cool Spanish Heist Show/That Cool Latin American Cop Show/That Korean Drama About White Explorers may be *less* enthused with the originals."
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,I actually like some of Netflix's original content.  The only problem is for every 1 good show there's like at least 10 that I don't like.

Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Yep.
Over Half of New Netflix Content Next Month is Original,Nextflix buys a lot of programming and puts their name on it FYI.

Cox OTT,"I can't speak to what Cox offers, but it's actually not usually the case that you need an electrician to move a coax line. It's one of the more simple rewiring projects you can do in a house. It's low voltage and completely safe to for non-pros to handle.Even if the issue is structural and you simply can't figure out how to re-route the cable to where you want it, you'd be better off looking for a low-voltage contractor or even a handyman to do it, as they will usually be cheaper, because they don't need to hold electrical licenses.One of the most common misconceptions among homeowners is that where the cable comes in is where the cable comes in and they just have to live with their TV in a bad location or crappy wifi. They often don't. Cheers."
Cox OTT,This is great to know. Thank you so much!
Cox OTT,Cox will come out and move a line for a small fee.  If they caught your in-laws with their add-on that covers in-house wiring it may even be free (since they already pay for it).  Check what the fee is before they dispatch anyone because I've seen it cost $50 (reasonable) and I've seen it cost $150 (not reasonable).
Cox OTT,That is a good tip about the add-on thing. I'll ask them to check on that. Thank you!
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,what is the pricing and speed new customers would get?
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,"Was able to get 100/100 for 39.99 for a year. Expect to negotiate next year, but it's nice for now. "
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,I got Gigabit + HD TV Package + 1 Year Netflix + CableCard Rental + Taxes & Fees comes to a grand total of....... $79....... for 3 years
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,I'm in South Jersey and got 100/100 for 50 per month plus $100 installation (fiber optics right inside to my modem) and next year it will be 65 then I renegotiate. So essentially 57.50 for 2 years down from 155 per month with Comcast for tv I barely watched and internet that was 180 down and 12 yes only 12 up. I love FiOS internet. Consistently get WiFi speeds of 90+/90+
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,Gigabit for $75 or 75mb/s for $55. Hmmmmm
Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,"🤷🏻‍♂️ No need for gigabit right now with how we use it, so I’d rather save the $20 a month. I can always upgrade online if I feel like I need it"

Successfully cut the cord with FiOS!,I just canceled Fios triple play. Price said 79.99 a month. But my bill was 148. Said to hell with this. Asked them can I just get the 100/100 internet for 39.99 and they said it’s only for new customers. So I asked what’s the last day of the billing cycle. They said the 26th. So I said cancel everything on the 25th. Waited 1 week. Went online and setup a new account and got the 39.99 deal. Everything is fine. Didn’t even have to come to my house. Now....I get the last statement for the triple play 79.99 deal. Says I owe 148. Balance says -4:87. I’m lost. Can’t figure out do I owe these people money or not. Go to Verizon store where I returned equipment and speak to store rep. He says he doesn’t know and calls Fios. Fios rep on phone says they don’t know. Store rep puts phone on mute and says you don’t owe anything. This is how they try to trick you into paying a last bill. These people are fucking evil. Why can’t they just be honest? I don’t know. And don’t fucking care

Thinking about moving to Hulu from FIOS,"Hulu w/Live is great, especially when considering that you get access to Hulu’s base VOD catalog, plus any additional VOD added with the Live TV add-on.I would go ‘all-in’ for the best value.Hulu with Live TV + the no commercials* add-on + the Enhanced 200hr DVR** add-on is $60, and this includes the base Hulu VOD catalog of TV shows, originals, movies, and day after it airs network TV with no commercials (no other service has this.)*The no commercials add-on does not apply to the additional VOD you get the from additional Live TV channels. It only applies to the base Hulu VOD catalog.**The Enhanced DVR is required for being able to FF commercials.A few other benefits of Hulu w/Live is that there are no DVR restriction on recording local channels and you get both East and West coast feeds.Edit: I would also get a quality dedicated streaming device, don’t go cheap."

Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,Vue Core with Redzone ($10) during nfl season (No brainer
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,Redzone is a selling point. But why Vue?
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,PSVue is what you want. 
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,Ok. Why do you say that?
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,Vue is the best overall service if it has your locals.
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,Hulu DVR is great as long as you get the Enhanced 200hr add-on.
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,"That's what I have read, but of course that is an additional cost."
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,"I like Direct-TV now. It hasn't failed me yet. Their pre-purchase bonuses are also ridiculously good deals.

Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,I don't fault you for the 4 month prepay for hardware but in 4 months switch to PS Vue.
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,It seems like they got rid of the apple TV deal or else I'd jump on that. 
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,[removed]
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,"You could also pair YouTube TV or Vue with Philo ($16) for channels you're missing. DirecTV Now is unreliable. Hulu is pretty good. Do some free trials and test for yourself. Remember, you can use your live tv streaming account with many network apps (including sports) for shows/movies and games. "
Advice on Live Streaming TV Services,I’d say if you think you’ll take advantage of Hulu’s massive library then that’s the way to go. You can’t beat that price for all of the content you get. Otherwise it seems like Vue would be a good choice for your sports fix. It’s a fantastic service although I think outside of sports the price is a bit bloated for what you get.

Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"I have a 1 TB cap from my ISP and the family uses Hulu/Youtube for maybe 2-3 hours every day. I also play some computer games, but they aren't heavy multiplayer games.  I have never come close to reaching 1 TB in a month. In fact, last I checked, I never even broke 400 GB. This includes occasionally downloading large games on Steam. I don't know what resolution the video on Hulu is though."
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"Thanks that makes me feel better about the days cap. If regular cable is a higher resolution and looks better for sports games, I'll probably go with that. If not ps vue would save me a bit of money."

Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"1TB Cap here, (comcrap, Opps. Comcast) tried to cut the cord...Had DTV Now, Netflix. 4 People streaming in the house. We hit the cap twice. "
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"This was a concern of mine when I cut the cord and so far it's working out fine. I've never exceeded my data cap in the year or so I've been cable free.I'm a gamer too and while I've typically always opted for physical copies anyway, I do like to download the Games with Gold and PS+ games every month which add up fast. I won't lie to you, you're going to have to exercise some restraint and planning when it comes to your game downloads and streaming time. 1TB a month is manageable but, like you said, it's still easy to go over if you're not careful.I'm currently using Directv Now which, from what I understand, is the biggest data hog of the streaming services although I think Vue is not far behind (just the price you pay for that sweet sweet PQ). Depending on the month you're looking at about 33GB a day. I would just do a trial of Vue and don't even turn on the cable box for that week. Only use Vue and the other streaming services you typically use and then track how much you're using each day over the course of that free trial and extrapolate that over a month's time. It should give you a decent idea of how close to the cap you'll get and whether or not you need to take steps to reduce your data usage. We've had to be better about turning streams off when we leave the room, or switching over to antennae if we just want background noise. Online gaming doesn't really use much data, it's your girlfriend's netflix/hulu and the tv watching you guys do that's going to chip away at that cap fast. And of course you'll need to plan out your game downloads accordingly. If I know I'm not going to have a chance to play the game any time soon I'll hold off til later in the week when I can consciously make sure I'm shoring up some data over those few days to download it later on.Like I said, it's going to require a bit of a lifestyle change, and honestly there's a bit of added stress monitoring your data usage every month. So do the trial and see how things go."
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"Thanks! We both work a lot so I don't think we would use quite that much, but I could see it being about the same. The other thing is I typically leave the tv on for my dogs while no one is home, so that could be an issue too. I do have an antenna that could be used for that, so that should eliminate that problem. I think I'm going to try the ps vue.&#x200B;Do you happen to know what kind of resolution directvnow is vs regular cable for sports for example? "
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"1TB Comcast cap here. 2 AppleTV4 (1080P), DTVNow streaming service, 3 occupants in the house including wife (Works from home 2-3 hours per day via VPN), CS college student (online gaming and programming). We also have Netflix, Amazon Prime. Watch 3-4 hours per day streaming, plus 4-6 hours on weekends.My average monthly use is 500-600GB. We hit close to 900 once, but in 2+ years, have yet to hit the cap.Not sure about PSVue, never tried it.For local channels, we use an antenna with a Table DVR which can stream to all our devices. OTA signals are uncompressed 1080p and of course don't impact data caps as it all streams on the LAN."
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),It was fine for my family of 4 until we went 4K.  Then I shattered it 4 months in a row until I had to change to an ISP without a cap (but pretty brutal throttling). 
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"Most live tv streams in 720 or 1080p, I think only VOD stuff from Netflix, Prime and some of the premium VOD services even offer 4k (some special sports events could get it depending on service as well). Data cap will really depend on use. Also if you buy digital copies of games those can get pretty large. Before cutting the cord I was around 300gb a month average which included my son who streams everything. I switched to an uncapped plan so I don't even check. Comcast lets you see your usage, if you are using less than half of your cap you'll probably survive. "
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"Just my wife and I at home but we both work from home and are online all day. We also stream Vue, Hulu and Netflix, some times separately. We never exceed 500GB. A normal month for us is around 400GB. I believe most sports on Vue are 60fps nowadays, at least the major sports. Granted, we only have a 55"" TV but the streaming quality is pretty darn good. We've been lucky not to have any buffering issues. We did have some when we tried DirectvNow and Hulu Live TV earlier this year but I've heard they are getting better too. Vue has been rock solid for us. YTTV was too when we tried that. I think you will really like streaming TV. I would never go back. It's much cheaper for us, the picture quality is definitely good enough for us and we actually now have access to far more content. I could never justify the higher cable TV offerings for things like NBA TV, SECNetwork, etc and they are just included free as part of Vue Core. We get a ton more sports than we ever had before. My wife isn't especially happy about that but I'm thrilled. Hope that helps. "
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"We're a family of 4 w/ a 1TB data cap and were on PSVue for years.  It's pretty tricky to avoid hitting a cap with that many people all online and it's not just PSVue.  Netflix and software updates and gaming all take their toll. That said, I think you two will be just fine. It gets a little trickier as the size of the household increases, though. If you're still concerned, then there are some things that will help manage your data limit:1. If you have a wireless phone plan that includes unlimited data, then USE IT! You're paying for it. This takes some of the burden off your home internet.  Only 3 of us are old enough to have phones, but we got on the TMobile One Plus plan back when they had a crazy promotion going on and we have 3 lines of ""unlimited"" (throttled after 50GB/user each month) for a combined total of only $80/mo., taxes included.  We have a rule that there is no connecting to wi-fi in the house.  I estimate we probably conserve about 100GB/mo of our home internet data limit by making sure our phones do everything over LTE.2. I just installed Windows 10 last night so I thought I'd point out that by default it is set up to use your internet connection as a P2P server to help others download windows updates.  That is a big no-no if you're on a data cap so be sure to turn it off.  We have 4 computers in the home I'm in the process of updating to Windows 10 so that could easily kill our 1TB data cap.  In fact, I also recommend changing the auto-update settings so that it doesn't automatically check/download any updates without you doing it manually. There are a ton of settings in Windows 10 you should probably also turn off if you want to conserve bandwidth.3. I haven't tried it yet, but there is an open-source router firmware you can flash to certain compatible routers called *Gargoyle* that will allow you to set data quotas for devices.  You can make them daily quotas, you can set times when they just can't connect at all, you can set monthly quotas, etc... If you have a device you're worried about eating up too much data, you can limit it through the router.  Maybe you don't want your Roku/FireTV streaming box to use up more than 400GB in a month -- you can make sure it gets cut off when that happens. Or, you can even set the router to limit the max throughput to the device which will force Youtube/Netflix/Etc... to stream at a lower resolution which will conserve more bandwidth. You could maybe also set up another rule that limits your gaming device to 400GB and then give each of your computers a 75GB/mo limit which will leave 50GB available for emergencies and other less demanding devices to access.  I've heard that you can also upload a custom hosts file to the router that will block, at the router, advertising sites so that when you are on the web you aren't wasting precious bandwidth."
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),Agree with suggestion #1. I restricted the kids from my home WiFi. Let them watch on YouTube on LTE all they want. 
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"If you have a moderate usage, you'll be fine.&#x200B;Unless I self-regulate, I can hit the data cap very easily (and I will die before I give these greedy bastards a cent more) but I'm what you call a heavy user -> Have my own homelab alongside with games, updates, 4k streaming, offsite backup, vpn, development, etc.&#x200B;Overall I usually get close to 800-900Gb by going easy (First ""courtesy"" month I blew was multi-TB usage, that was a good month.)"
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"We are a family of 6 and we BARELY stay under the cap. We also have 1TB. One time we went over, but we stay like 30GB under the cap. I'm the only heavy Internet user in the house, I've downloaded like 150GB of data. So if you aren't a /r/DataHoarder like me you should be fine. We use DirecTV NOW and an OTA antenna. We don't usually do 4K. Some routers (Like Netgear's) allow you to set your own cap. It will basically warn you when you start to reach your cap (Like 150GB away from the cap), and shut off completely when you are like 10GB away from the cap.  It's a good way to make sure you don't get charged for overages."
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"We just got DirectTV Now and it is killing our data cap. We used 70gb yesterday and that's just two TVs.

Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"in most cases, 1 Tb is just fine for a 2 person household"
Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"I didn’t read everything you wrote but regarding data usage. I don’t have a cap. Household of two, we have gone over 1tb 5 times since January. Never more than 2 TVs on at a time.  One TV splits usage between antenna and dtvn/Netflix and the other is usually streaming something if it’s on at all. Our mobile devices use very little of that data. Things we stream are 720-1080. No 4K needed. I do game on pc so that adds a bit of usage with updates and everything but I don’t game too much now days. Edit: tip as said, make sure your streaming device goes to the home screen when tv is off. I have commands programmed into my harmony remotes to make sure it always does without having to think about it when turning tv off. "

Is a 1 TB data cap enough AND what resolution do the channels stream in? (Two Questions),"It is actually comcast. That $30 to $35 I mentioned is how much they charge when you go over the internet data cap. I may be wrong, but I think that's pretty close to the cost. At&t fiber is slowly expanding but it's not everywhere here yet. "
"CBS All Access, confused",If you subscribed via Google Play then that means billing is done through Google Play and won't appear via CBS's billing tools.
"CBS All Access, confused","It's the norm for some streaming platforms, some allow subscription through the playstore, but Google takes 15% when you do it that way. Some go as far as keeping that account locked to devices that are running Google play services, so if you try to login with anything else, it won't work. Part of the reason is to insensitivise you to subscribe with them directly. Other streaming platforms like Netflix or Amazon Prime force you now to make an account with them directly and in the case of Netflix no longer accept subscriptions through the playstore. What confuses me about CBS all access in Canada, is why the fuck did they even bother, all the good content is already sold to other streaming platforms, leaving you with the bottom of the barrel in what CBS has to offer. They should have just waited for those streaming rights to expire. "
"CBS All Access, confused","I am having the same issue except the android app says ""subscribe"" just under my login screen name.

Trying to cut down cost...,"60 mbps is plenty. That's 12 concurrent HD streams or 2 concurrent 4K streams.Also, if you happen to be a gamer, know that outside of downloading the games/patches, gaming itself takes very little bandwidth."
Trying to cut down cost...,My speed is usually 50ish and I download and stream all the time with no issues. I'd go for the 60.
Trying to cut down cost...,"Can you switch providers? Seriously, these people don't offer you value until you fire them at least once."
Trying to cut down cost...,"We've tried Verizon (not FIOS), and their speeds can't even load a 5 minute YouTube video without buffering 10 times. We lasted for a whole month. Optimum isn't available. So, Comcast is all we have. "
Trying to cut down cost...,This. Those offers are pretty terrible although I don't know where OP lives.You guys will be able to get along just fine with the 60mbps but for $86 that's pretty ridiculous. 
Trying to cut down cost...,"Well, you probably don’t need 150 Meg internet. A single HD video stream uses less than 10 megs.  Things like web browsing and online gaming are far less than that. That said, dropping the TV will save you only about $30 per month. You can’t get a live streaming service (Vue, YouTube TV, etc) for less than that. If you are willing to completely cut TV, losing access to ESPN, CNN, TNT, TBS, USA, etc., then you’ll save thirty bucks. Depending on where you are relative to broadcast towers, you might be able to hang an antenna and get ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox for free. But if you are unwilling to live without all of those channels, I don’t see a cheaper alternative than what you have now. (Actually there are a couple streaming services you could look into. Philo has a bundle of channels with no sports or news for $16 per month. Sling has a couple packages for $25. But you’ll have to ask yourself if moving to those skinny options is worth saving $5-15 per month.)"
Trying to cut down cost...,We don't watch tv so saving $30 per month seems like a good deal. The details about the speed is really helpful. Thanks
Trying to cut down cost...,Be careful to also look at the upload speed.
Trying to cut down cost...,"It'll be the same as the 150, which is 5mbps..."
Trying to cut down cost...,"Seems this is the typical thing Cable ISP's do. They make the TV part a small additional cost but discount the internet so long as you take TV or IP phone or some other services. Wanna save 10 bucks and not sacrifice the speed, I'd keep the 150mbps package. Especially if you are both going to be using it at the same time. But that's just me. I'd see what other ISP's around you have to offer. I'd also try negotiating with the cable company. Mine is very open to negotiating, especially if they think I am going to drop them. But I live in a large city with lots of competition, so your millage may vary in this regard. "
Trying to cut down cost...,"Consider this,They almost certainly have an offer called Internet Plus with internet, HBO and/or Showtime, and limited basic (just put the analog cable box in the closet and don't lose it) for much less than the $86 60Mbps plan you were offered.It should be $60, $65 at the most after you include the bs fees (my bill has $8 fees - for broadcast and franchise fee)."
Trying to cut down cost...,"Personally, I would drop to the 60mbps as it should cover more than what you need.  Our son is and he did well at that speed."
"When will Amazon offer local channels similar to Sling and VUE, etc..?????","Not anytime soon. They were exploring a live service but decided against it. Securing local channels is a tedious task and I doubt they will even attempt to offer it. They will, however, continue to build their Channels platform which is à la carte. "
"When will Amazon offer local channels similar to Sling and VUE, etc..?????","It'd actually be easier for Amazon to get cable channels than local channels. Due to the way the law is currently setup, local stations charge tons for ""retransmission fees"". And once you have to negotiate with the thousands of local stations, and their owners, across the entire country, that gets complicated and expensive fast. That's the reason why the cheapest OTT cable providers like Philo and AT&T Watch TV don't include any local channels. Sling TV barely contains any. And the more expensive services just focus on the biggest networks like ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, CW, and maybe Telemundo and Univision for Spanish content."

ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,"I've gotta give ESPN credit. As much as they're doing horribly wrong with their main stations, they're making a strong argument for ESPN+ by transitioning their previous ESPN3 content over as well as adding some content that used to fall through the cracks. $4.99 is the perfect price for this service."
ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,"Well espn 3 was free...  So there was that..   Most of these sport hold zero interest to me, but the price point is fair and who am I to say that mls or whatever is not worth $4.95"
ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,"Is it just me or is this the first steps of ESPN transitioning to an overall OTT service. Sure it’ll take years to fully transition, but imagine a day where you can subscribe to ESPN+ and then choose their other networks that you can add like ESPN/ESPN 2/News/U/Sec Network. I don’t even have a problem with them transitioning ESPN3 to a paid service like they have when they added UFC/Serie A and much more to come. "
ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,Nope not going to happen as all of this is going to end up in the Disney offering coming up in the next 6 to 12 months.To be clear this is a money grab by ESPN who knows that they can't up their fees to cable/streaming services even further. So instead they break out content and bring some new content to a stand alone service. They likely know a majority of their subscribers actually will have a service and ESPN+.
ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,"ESPN+ is superb value with all the extra content they've added. Serie A is a big one (for me at least).I just wish they'd take Around The Horn, toss it in to a dumpster, set it on fire, take it out of the dumpster, steamroller it, let a dog urinate on it, run a tank over it, toss it in a car compactor, put it in to a cannon, aim it in to space and fire the goddamn show at a comet hurtling away and out of our entire solar system so we never ever see it again.The only caveat being it could spark a future invasion by an alien race should they ever be unfortunate enough to somehow watch it."
ESPN+ to host majority of AE sports,"It's strange to me why anyone would care when you are talking about on-demand programming. If you don't like the material, don't watch it and watch something else. It's one thing in a linear \[cable\] world where poor programming is eating up the bandwidth in lieu of some other material you would prefer to watch. "

It's high frequency, short range.The higher the frequency, the greater the symbol rate, the higher the data throughput, the higher the bandwidth, etc.BUT,The higher the frequency is, the shorter the practical range is, due to occlusion/absorption by solid objects like walls, structures, trees, rain and other elements.

Maybe they'll start recycling the older 4G gear in as they replace it with 5G in other areas, which wouldn't be terrible. A lot of the cell towers we serve see maybe 10Mbps - 20Mbps of usage.

Removal of cable running to house from pole,"I had this exact issue when I moved into the house. We're on RCN, but there was another, obviously abandoned coax coming from the pole on the opposite side of my house that was hanging really low and I hated it.The problem, however, is that in some counties, tv and phone providers often have the right to keep wires running to your house, and often times, the right to keep equipment (like FiOS terminals) on your property, even if you don't subscribe to their service. The rationale being, it's not fair to make Verizon spend the money to add fiber to a house, then have to remove it, then reinstall it again, because the house happens to sell to different owners over time with different preferences.I had my electrician over the very first week and he suspected I might get some resistance if I called the county about a line that was simply ugly, but not necessarily dangerous. So he said, I got you. He cut it from the house and let it fall in the yard. Then he told me to call the county. I called and said, ""There's a line hanging from the pole into my yard."" They called Comcast and a guy rolled out the very next morning and removed it.I'm NOT saying to do what my electrician did. I'm just saying, when you call the county (and you should...they often have cable company affairs departments that handle stuff like this), they might tell you there's nothing you can do. Good luck."

Removal of cable running to house from pole,"You're probably right that no one would miss it, but it's not like OP can remove it altogether, anyway. He can release it from his house, but no way should he try to remove it from the pole. Best he can do is coil it up and leave at the bottom."

Suggestions on antenna for OTA channels.,"Your report looks very similar to mine.  I'm a bit closer to Cheyenne, WY (\~ 45 miles) than Denver (\~53 miles).  Anyway, I'm using a ClearStream 4V mounted about 15 ft off the ground.  The VHF channels are a bit tough to reach since the CS4V doesn't have great VHF reception.  I get the Denver signals clearly though if I mount the antenna higher.  You can get the combination (refurbished) for about $70 through AntennsDirect.  In hindsight, I would probably have try the ChannelMaster CM-4228HD, which seems to be a bit better at getting UHF and VHF signals.  If you want a great signal and can stand it, I'd go for one of the big Yagi style antennas.  But that doesn't work for my situation."
Suggestions on antenna for OTA channels.,"A medium gain UHF/VHF-high antenna should work for the Tampa signals. Examples:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018If you have the room and a solid place to bolt the mount to (hurricanes?), there is no real reason not to go for a high gain antenna and get some more margin.

Trying to get rid of homephone,"> digital copies that will last forever.No such thing,  Can you now read a file from 1978 that was recorded to a punch tape, with a tape backup?  Probably not.  Can you read an analog LP from 1899 if you so wanted, with no more than a manual crank, a needle, and a cone made out of paper?  YES, YOU CAN!.  ""digital"" does not equal ""long life"".  For a less extreme example, can you even read a 3.5"" floppy from 1995?  Do you even have the equipment to do that anymore?  Can you even get a disk drive, if you wanted?  How about 5.25"" FDD's?  Can you read those today?"

Antenna power line through an unused furnace vent?,"Hmm...I'd like to know the answer to this, as well. My first instinct was to say, as long as you use plenum-rated cable, it might be fine. But if the vent is abandoned altogether...I can't imagine why you couldn't use it for whatever you want. It'd be a great way to run all sorts of cabling from top-to-bottom, especially ethernet.Will the cable carry 120v, or something stepped down?Hoping someone who knows the code around this type of stuff chimes in.Edit: OP, you should x-post this over at /r/HomeImprovement .

Service with the Best DVR?,"Margins on streaming services are razor thin. Analysts have projected that some services are paying out more in broadcast fees than they are currently charging customers. So several of them are using DVRs and added streams to help boost profits.  Silicon Dust just debuted a streaming service for its HD Homerun box which allows programs to be recorded locally to a PC or NAS. That’s the only service offering such an option—others are all cloud based. PS Vue: unlimited DVR, allows commercial skip on most channels (not Fox, random reports of others), ALL content is deleted after 28 daysYouTube TV: unlimited DVR, VOD overrides recording on some channels/programming with unskippable commercials, content is stored for 9 monthsDirectv Now: 20 hours of storage, allows commercial skip, content deleted after 30 days. They will supposedly release an enhanced DVR for extra fee (100 hours / 90 days has been rumored for about $10 per month.)Hulu: 50 hours of storage with no commercial skip. For $15 per month you can increase to 200 hours with commercial skip. Philo: unlimited storage, I believe recordings delete after 30 days but not 100% sure on this."
Service with the Best DVR?,>Silicon DustThats the reason I went with these guys.
Service with the Best DVR?,"Live TV streaming services with an option to record offer cloud DVR. They each have their own rules. Entire seasons of a show don't really appear on demand, but current episodes do. It's best to DVR your show(s) so that you can skip commercials. Directv Now isn't reliable and Sling is inconsistent. PS Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, FuboTV, and Philo are all good. "

Help with Antenna,"You have fairly good signal. However, your weakest of the big network channels is a VHF channel (WJBK/Fox).  And the square antennas don't get the best VHF reception, so you might be better off with a cheap pair of rabbit ears.  If you want to test the one you bought, try it without the amp first, as I don't think that should really be needed unless you have some obstructions between you and the transmitter that tvfool is not aware of (like large buildings or trees)."
Help with Antenna,Thank you! I’ll give it a try without the amp. I tried with the amp a few times and it wasn’t finding any of the major stations. 
Help with Antenna,It might work fine.  You have a lot of strong signals close to you.  Are you in a house?  Apartment?  Can you put the antenna by a window?  All those things can make a difference.I wouldn't worry about it too much unless the antenna doesn't work.  You do have a few vhf-hi signals! I'm not sure if that antenna will pick them up very well.

How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,I made this cookie tin lid antenna and it works great. https://youtu.be/KVvO6021VIc
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,I used a website that showed what type of antenna I needed. Then I got that antenna.  Antenna's are a tough thing to buy because there are so many variables. I bought all mine locally so I could easily return them if they didn't work. 
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,"I read round up reviews on Toms Hardware etc and picked based on that. Was easy b/c they talked very specifically about the NYC area, so I didn't have issues with guessing how each would work in my area."
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,"I looked at TVFool.com and quickly decided I wanted an omnidirectional powered antenna.  So I bought a Winegard 2000 Amplified antenna (they don't make it anymore).   It looks like a flying saucer in my attic.The decision was easy..  with a powered omnidirectional, not much thinking is required."
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,"I used online sources and built and tested my own until I came up with the design that works for the past 2 1/2 years outside and feeding 3 TVs.  Not hard and fun to do, and I've tested with a couple of store-bought antennas and none worked as well."
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,"I ended up doing a lot of reading, researching and asking on forums like these.  Still, I did end up buying 4 different antennas before finding the best one for my needs.  I still have two of them down in the basement collecting dust.  I was able to successfully return one of them back to Amazon for a refund.  In my case, all channels are in a single direction, but about 75 miles away.  More than anything else, location and height played the biggest role in the success of my installation.  I ended up with a huge directional antenna from Winegard."
How did you go about choosing your first OTA antenna?,Spent weeks researching here (reddit cordcutter) and internet.  Finally decided on a Mohu Leaf 50.Garbage!Stick with streaming services.
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,I have this and use the Channels DVR to record the channels locally to my NAS. No Cloud DVR. The files are mine and I can do what I want to do with them. To me that is a great advantage. 
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"I have it, mostly because the Viacom channels will be absent from my HomeRun Prime if they ever release the six tuner version.  The flexibility with channels DVR is awesome, I have the tuners at my commercial location with fiber internet, and I can watch it at home or just about anywhere. "
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,Only two issues with it they need to fix.East coast subscribers will get nine or so west coast channels.  They know about this and have no plans to fix it.  So enjoy the show three hours after everyone else sees it.The bitrate is way too low.  2.5 meg 720p.  Its compressed so much that artifacts are on the screen.  It needs double that bitrate so it looks better.Fix those two and I'll subscribe.
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"I'd hope for 1080p and more bitrate for sure, I'll subscribe and deal with it for now."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"It’s way over price for what you get. They honestly would need to get some more sports channels, RSN’s and a couple more entertainment channels to get my eye."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"Agree missing RSN’s are a big hole to be filled.  But objectively, 45 channels including ESPN ($$$) for $35 is not “way overpriced”. Sling Orange is $25 for fewer than 30 channels. YouTube TV is $40 for about 60 channels...with a fair amount of filler (2 cheddar networks, Tastemade, TYT, Comet, Decades, etc.)  It’s similar to the “Live a Little” plan from Directv Now which also has no RSN or sports league networks (NBA, NFL, etc) for $40 per month.It won’t be the best match for everyone’s personal viewing habits, but the price isn’t out of line with others. Have to give SD some credit for getting skinny packages from just about every major broadcast conglomerate for a reasonable price. While streamers like YTTV, PS Vue and Hulu typically ignore certain broadcasters to keep prices down, SD has some representation from Disney, Fox, A+E, AMC, Discovery, Viacom, etc.  (Exclusion of FXX is sort of a head-scratcher to me, though)"
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"You have no idea what you are talking about, it has 32 out of the top 35 channels"
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"It’s a decent program package. As someone who currently uses YouTube TV, there’s some appeal in going back to antenna rather than relying on Internet for local channels.  However, I don’t have an always-on PC or NAS—all of my personal docs are on laptop. And when I was regularly using my HD Homerun, out-of-home streaming was always temperamental. YTTV has the forced VOD thing which impacts some of my content (not as much as one may think), but it’s simple to operate and works on any device, in or out of house. YTTV + Philo gives me a lot more channels for not much more cost than this Silicon Dust product without having to buy and maintain additional hardware."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,it's over priced for what they offer.
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"Agreed.  I have a Quattro and still run it through Plex so at least I can skip commercials on OTA recordings if YTTV VoDs them.  Most of my YTTV watching is cable news so I don’t run into the VOD all that often.  While I do have an always on PC for now, I also have to Shields so but I would need to hardwire them to run as Plex Servers.A combination of YTTV imposing more restrictions and better HDHR stream quality and I might switch."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"I LOVE IT. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and it is better than any of the other services on price/channel value for me. It's only $35/month and if you want DVR you have to fork out $35 for a year but that is only about $3/month extra.  Once you set it up, there are no credentials needed for the devices that you watch it on, so there is no hassle. The interface is lacking, but it works. I assume it will get better over time."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"> if you want DVR you have to fork out $35 for a yearNo you only have to do that if you want to use their DVR service.  However, you can use any DVR software that supports the HDHomeRun devices (including some open source ones)."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,if only i could get signal where i live.
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"What do you mean? You don't need any signal, My HD HomeRun Extend is sitting without any antenna attached subscribed to Premium TV."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,Can these subscription channels be accessed via the HTTP API?  Would be nice to tune to channels via the media player of my choosing instead of HDHR's apps.
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"The streaming happens within the HDHR device firmware itself, and works with many 3rd party apps that connect to that. The Channels DVR and client apps work beautifully. "
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,">But to record live channels, you’ll also need a NAS box, an always-on computer (such as a desktop Windows PC or Mac), or an [Nvidia Shield TV](https://www.techhive.com/article/3159599/streaming-hardware/nvidia-shield-tv-second-generation-review-this-the-best-media-streamer-for-geeks.html).  This ended up being the reason I didn't go with the HDHomeRun. I would have been more attracted if there was an option where I could just connect an external drive directly to the device, even if it would have made for a more expensive device."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"Actually, they're planning on releasing a box that has the tuner, DVR service, and storage all built in.  It was announced at CES this year.  Not sure when they'll actually release it, though."
HDHomeRun Premium TV could be the holy grail for antenna users,"Personally I'd rather have them separate, since I already have a desktop PC and wouldn't want a premium for something I don't need. IMO they don't make a big enough deal out of this but a WD My Cloud NAS with 2 TB of storage is just $140 and can handle HDHomeRun/Plex/Channels DVR."

Cable Card box selection,"Are you in a legacy Charter or a legacy TWC/BHN area?  If you're in a legacy Charter area, you might have luck and your channels aren't all copy-once (I've heard that they didn't have a strict policy on this so it varies by region)*, but if you're in a legacy TWC/BHN area, then your channels are all probably copy-once (except the locals).  Which means your only option for recording is a Tivo or a cable card tuner with Windows Media Center (which requires Windows 7 or 8, it does not work in 10).  If you're in a legacy Charter area and your channels are copy-freely, then you can use pretty much any DVR system that works with a HDHomeRun Prime (so all you'd need attached to your TV is a streaming box that supports MPEG-2 and has an app for the DVR).\* To find out if your channels are copy freely you can tune to a channel you care about, enter the tuner diagnostics (how you do that depends on your box) and check for the CCI Flag.  If it's 0x02 that means copy-once which requires the output to be protected by DRM, which only the Tivo and WMC support."
Cable Card box selection,"Just something to ponder, Apple announced they would start doing cable service via Apple TV with Charter being the first company to do it. It might be worth waiting a bit to see what comes of it."

"TCL 49"" 49S403 for $289 at Costco","maybe i'm a TV image quality snob but I really can't stand the ""reviews are great for a budget TV"" the problem is most people buying and reviewing these entry level TV's have never had a quality unit so they don't know just how bad these entry level units really are. I've seen more then my share of uneven grey uniformity and other issues from entry level units.I don't see an rtings.com review for the S403, I found one for the S405 which is a pretty dim unit when it comes to brightness and lacks local dimming (expected at this price point) which is enough I wouldn't consider the unit.that said integrated Roku is nice, I have an older smaller 32"" TCL Roku TV and the Antenna Integration is pretty nice, apps like Pluto will integrate the OTA channels right into it's own guide and if you just use the regular antenna input you can plug up a USB hard drive and get the like 90 minute live TV pause thing"

I have recommended this series to tons of people, and they all love them. the 6-series from this year is even a great picture. My 1 complaint is banding during dark scenes. but again, $300.That said, I also have a $2000 65"" Sony XBR 4K TV in my basement for movies and games, properly calibrated, attached to a great 7.1 speaker set.

What TV can you find at a similar price point per size and has actually useful local dimming?  Cause I haven't found any.The Vizio 2017 E-Series review said it's local dimming was ""very poor."" It only has 12 zones, which means there aren't enough for it to really be useful.  Then on top of that it doesn't come with a TV tuner or have the built-in Roku (sure it has it's own smart tv platform, but it's does not have as extensive of an app library as the Roku).The Hisense models at the same price range at least came with Roku or Android TV.  But they too don't have enough zones in their local dimming for it to be useful.  And I couldn't even find a review for it on rtings.com when I was looking for a TV (so not sure if they since added one).The only other one I could find at that price point is the Toshiba Fire TV, which doesn't have local dimming either.Pretty much all of them have brightness and viewing angle issues.  But that's not really a big deal for most people who are watching at night in dimly light rooms from directly in front of the screen.  So sure, you could spend more to get a better display.

Best sports app to use for cord cutters?,"I've had YouTube TV for about four months and have been very happy with it as someone who only really cares about the live sports content. It is clearly better overall when compared to the others I've tried (FuboTV, Sling and DirecTV Now).Hulu Live has the same sports content, but you can save some money with Hulu Live (which includes all Hulu content) if you'd subscribe separately to Hulu in addition to a live service.PS Vue has NFL Network and Redzone, but many areas seem to lack local channels. You'll need to see what it has in your area. While the big carrot for many sports fans is NFL Network/Redzone, with Redzone your package will be about $55/mo. There's too much NFL content on sports TV to begin with, so I can do without them. Vue also has NHL Network, but I get my local team via my regional channels.FuboTV is pretty good, but I only recommend it for someone who doesn't need the ESPN channels. It's good for soccer and has local regional sports channels.Sling and DirecTV Now I didn't like much at all. Sling was clunky and unreliable for me over a trial period. I took advantage of a three-month DTVN promo, but switched to YouTube TV early and on a whim because a playoff basketball game I was trying to watch on DTVN was buffering constantly. The same game was perfect on YouTube and I've never had any significant issues with the service.All these services offer free trials, so you should really try them all out to see what you like best. They'll all enable you to login to sports apps like ESPN, Fox Sports Go, NBC Sports, etc. to watch live games or replays there too."

How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,Typically none of electrical protection can with stand the surge coming from lightning strike. Hopefully your home insurance can help reimbursing the damages.
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,Ok that makes me feel a little better. I’ve been beating myself up thinking that maybe I did something wrong.
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"Yep, lighting can do weird things. Just be happy your house didn’t catch fire. "
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,You did your job. Lightning is unpredictable.The guys who maintain cell sites and radio towers have the same problem. Imagine trying to gage when a gas tube has taken it's limit of hits? Even with the best hardware in the business - stuff still gets fried.
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"Let's hear from the guys who do this stuff on mountains:  http://scott-inc.com/html/ufer.htmOr another who did this stuff for broadcasting stations:> Well I assert, from personal and broadcast experience spanning 30 years, that you can design a system that will handle *direct lightning strikes* on a routine basis. It takes some planning and careful layout, but it's not hard, nor is it overly expensive. At WXIA-TV, my other job, we take direct lightning strikes nearly every time there's a thunderstorm. Our downtime from such strikes is almost non-existant.  The last time we went down from a strike, it was due to a strike on the power company's lines knocking *them* out, ...> The keys to effective lightning protection are surprisingly simple, and surprisingly less than obvious. Of course you *must* have a single point ground system that eliminates all ground loops. And you must present a low *impedance* path for the energy to go. That's most generally a low *inductance* path rather than just a low ohm DC path.Or a case study on how Orange Count FL stopped having damage from lightning:http://www.psihq.com/AllCopper.htmIn 2002 earthing was upgraded which ended future damage.Lightning is only capricious when one foolishly assumes protectors do protection.  When protectors are connecting devices to what does protection and the protection is upgraded, then human mistakes (ie using plug-in protectors) not longer cause damage."
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"Only item that does surge protection is not mentioned - earth ground.  Wall receptacle safety grounds do nothing to protect hardware.  An in-line coax protector does nothing for protection if not connected low impedance (ie less than 10 feet) to single point earth ground.  Plug-in protectors can make surge damage easier.Damage from a surge is directly traceable to human mistakes.  Apparently plenty were made.  Some are listed above.Lightning is not capricious as so many only assume - because so many did not even know of the so many mistakes listed in that first paragraph.Lightning blew right through a protector?  That classic fable is promoted by the naive to the uneducated.  Nothing 'blocks' a surge.  Anyone (anything) that tries to is drinking the kool-aid.  Do you really think an in-line protector will block what three miles of sky cannot? Do you really believe hundreds or thousand (near zero) joules in a magic plug-in strip does anything useful for surges (that can be hundreds of thousands of joules)? Protection from direct lightning strikes is routine in every town.  Your telco CO suffers about 100 surges with each storm.  Ecery town still has phone service during and four days after every storm.  Simple protection is that effective.  They don't foolishly try to block a surge.  They do not waste money on adjacent, plug-in magic boxes.  And do not listen to the so many manipulated naive who claim nothing can avert lightning damage.A cited cordcutter.com text only introduces ""why it is important to ground an outdoor  antenna"".  Apparently the installation even violated those simple concepts.Effective protection always answers this question.  Where do hundreds of thousands of joules harmlessly dissipate.  Once a surge is anywhere inside a structure, then what only remains is is robust protection already inside appliances.  And that can be compromised is a plug-in protector is anywhere nearby.  If a surge is so massive as to even blow through best protection inside appliances, then a human has made some serious mistakes (some already listed).  A protector is only as effective as its low impedance, hardwire (ie not inside metallic conduit, no sharp wire bends, etc) connection to and quality of single point earth ground.  All other grounds (wall receptacle, digital, virtual, chassis, analog, floating, anti-static, etc) are irrelevant.  But myths often educate the scammed to increase profits.Not listed is single point earth ground, each dedicated and low impedance (ie less than 10 foot) hardwire connection to that ground, and an always essential 'whole house' protector."

I don't have my outdoor antenna very high (lots and lots of structures in the are taller), and it is tied properly to a grounding block -- I just don't have one of these surge protectors. Sorry for hijacking this thread.My guess is that they are just some MOVs in parallel across the coax positive and negative.​"
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"> My guess is that they are just some MOVs in parallel ...MOVs have excessive capacitance (as also noted in a post yesterday).  Other technologies also exist.

How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"I have a very large antenna atop a 40 foot mast beside my house.  At the base of the mast, there is an 8 foot ground rod driven into the ground.  The mast is connected to the ground rod via a #4 copper wire.  This ground rod is also bonded to the electrical service ground via a #10 copper wire that is on the other side of the house.  I have no idea if this setup would mitigate a direct strike though."
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,[deleted]
How do you guys have your antenna grounded?,"> Some say that properly grounding antennas may reduce the chances of a strike because it neutralizes static electricity build up that attracts ""feelers""That concept is called ESE.  ESE manufacturers wanted their products listed in codes as Article 781. It was roundly rejected for good reason.  Rather then do research to prove such protectors are effective, instead, in 1998 they sued using expensive lawyers to intimidate the NFPA.  So the NFPA did a study (see Bryan Panel) that basically said the entire concept is bogus.  And that ESE manufacturer should first prove their devices in research studies.Never happened.  Myth about discharging static to prevent lightning lives on with other fables and urban myths.Routine are direct lightning strikes without damage. But that means a transient current must find a best path to earth without being anywhere inside.  Effective protection without damage even to a protector has been routine for well over 100 years.  Based in the same concepts demonstrated by Franklin over 250 years ago.  Effective protection is that well proven.  And, unfortunately, unknown to a majority of consumers.MOVs have excessive capacitance; cannot be used on RF circuits.  A consumer must read specification number for a coax protector.  It should be 1 Ghz or higher - depending on its application.  And that protector does nothing useful if not hardwired low impedance (ie less than 3 meters) to single point earth ground.Coax protectors never block (stop) lightning.  Nothing does.Lightning is not capricious.  If a human makes a mistake, then lightning can be inside hunting for earth ground destructively via appliances.  If damage happens, an informed homeowner locates his mistake."
Custom TV Box HELP !!!,I couldn't find any SmartTV firmware that can be run on that IPTV box from Cisco (supplied by Vodafone TV). It's probably possible to do but you'd likely have to beak your terms of service in order to get around the security put in place to prevent piracy on the device just to flash the rom. You'd also need a custom rom (can you build one?) The only links I found were for shady russian websites that appear to just be watering holes (see 'watering hole attack') to put malware on your site using browser exploits. Don't click on any that you see. The short: you're probably better off just getting an inexpensive Roku or Fire TV stick. It will work better and save you days of headaches.

Best Streaming Box,"I have a Roku in one room and an Apple TV 4k in the other. My preference is with the Apple TV 4k. I like how there are no adverts on Apple's user interface screen like there is on Roku. I bought the device, don't make me feel like I'm leasing it by pushing ads at me."

Best Streaming Box,"I guess I should ask what’s better AppleTV, Roku, Chromecast or Amazon Fire?"
Best Streaming Box,If it came down to it I'd go with Atv 4k or a Nvidia Shield tv
Best Streaming Box,"It totally depends on what you are using it for.  Here are my thoughts:* If you just want to leisurely sit back and watch video content, the choice is Roku. They have the simplest interface and the most programming volume to choose from.*. If you are also into gaming, or if you intend to do more heavy duty things like side-loading files or apps directly into your box, I would recommend the Nvidia Shield.* I would recommend the Apple or Amazon Fire more so, if you are a heavy content user of their respective product lines.  Then there are direct synergies and advantages for having their box.* I love the Chromecast, but it's not really as much a source content box like the other devices.  But rather a player casting vehicle."

"Any all-in-one Pluto, Crackle, Vudu, and so forth reference?",I'd recommend the just watch app. It's customizable with an excellent search engine that lists the services a show or movie is available on (Paid or Free). I especially enjoy the daily update of new releases.
"Any all-in-one Pluto, Crackle, Vudu, and so forth reference?","Apple TV aggregates content from many third party apps. Crackle and PlutoTV are supported. Vudu isn’t, but you can use Movies Anywhere to link most of your Vudu films to iTunes which is supported.  Most broadcast and cable network apps are supported plus Amazon Prime, Hulu, PBS, HBO, etc. With supported apps installed, you can search across all of their VOD libraries, browse by category (comedies, dramas, etc.) and maintain a watch list for shows you are viewing. It will keep track of where you left off in viewing and alert when new episodes are available. Live news and sports also integrate with this same app. "
"Any all-in-one Pluto, Crackle, Vudu, and so forth reference?",I like the Roku search feature as well. It searches across a ton of channels/apps as well including most broadcast and cable network apps/channels. You can do a watch list with Roku. I can't remember what exactly Fire TV does.Hoopla Digital is one that I don't think is searchable by any place but its own app or website. 
"Any all-in-one Pluto, Crackle, Vudu, and so forth reference?",Try justwatch.com or reelgood.com. Note that neither will show pluto but you can use its website to help with that. Edit: Reelgood says that something broke during the last update but that you don't need to sign in even though I had trouble with that. Hopefully their their awesome filter that would search only through the free services will reappear.   Edit 2: Reelgood contacted me and it now has a [page](https://reelgood.com/source/free) to search for free content without setting up an account or anything else. 
Amplified antenna vs non amplified with separate amp?,"An amp will not make up for a bad signal.  It's only job is to overcome cable loss between the antenna and your tuner.  If you have a fairly short run to your tuner, go native with no amp.  If you need an amp, get an amp that is mast mounted, closest to the antenna, and has a low loss, like a Kitztech KT-200 with an ultra low noise figure of .4db."
Amplified antenna vs non amplified with separate amp?,I'm new to this also. What's the difference between an amp and a preamp? Thanks

You may not need the amp, but it's ready to add if you need it.I also had a inline amp on a 1byone indoor antenna.  The amp broke and the antenna was useless.  It was all one piece, so there was no way to just use the antenna.  It was a waste of money."
Amplified antenna vs non amplified with separate amp?,Is the RCA Yagi the best standalone for under $50?
Amplified antenna vs non amplified with separate amp?,"The best signal to noise ratio you're going to get is at the antenna, thus that's the best place for an amplifier. Ordinarily you're much better off with a preamp at the antenna or an antenna/amplifier combination (powered or amplified antenna).However, a poor quality preamp or amp in an amplified antenna may perform so badly that the advantage is dissipated.

beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,Hopefully ESPN+ gets La Liga rights.
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,"BeIN would have to die off entirely. Think La Liga is under wraps with them till 2022. I don’t think this is the end of BeIN. They’re trying to take the next step by getting on to the starter packages, but they’ll probably just end up reverting back to what they have always been."

beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,And to think it was a few months ago that it was a big deal that beIN was added to DirectTV Now via their new Spanish package.

beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,ESPN fútbol with All the Bein content 😍
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,At this point they should just make a streaming subscription service. Would be a great way to lure former DirectTV/U-verse/Xfinity viewers.
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,"No way will that be able to cover production costs. If you aren’t being carried by aT&T OR Comcast services, you’re in trouble. Idk if Charter or Spectrum carries them but it doesn’t even matter at that point They will be ripe for a buyout now. "
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,"No surprise. They followed the Viacom playbook in asking for more money than their channels are worth. After getting dropped by PlayStation Vue, they should have changed course and figured out that it isn't a winning strategy."
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,Viacom actually has content people want though.
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,"Will suck to lose access to a few of the big Spanish games per season, but I will be glad to see beIN fall. Skimped on hiring talent and hopefully will be a lesson to leagues not to sell your rights to an upstart offering the most money and having limited infrastructure in place. Their streaming services seem to be getting even worse somehow. "
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,Good. The sooner La Liga and Ligue 1 gets old to someone else the better. I don’t think this is gonna happen anytime soon though.I think it’s more likely that they just accept what Comcast and DirecTV are willing to pay after realizing everyone will do just fine without them.
beIN SPORTS in danger after being dropped by DIRECTV and U-Verse,It's most likely $0.10 and didn't increase from previous contract.http://www.whatyoupayforsports.com/numbers/

"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","If you have carpeting installed with tack strips, there's usually a cavity between the carpet and the shoe molding you can get some CAT6 down into with little trouble.  They also make flatCAT5 (at least) cable that will sit well below area rugs on hardwood floors."
"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?",This is how it’s done. At my old apartment I used the flat ribbon style Ethernet to get the connection across a room tucked under the base trim. Worked great and was very easy to tuck then remove when we moved out. I used a credit card to push the carver down and slide the cable in.
"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","I don't really understand the first part of what you said, but I can't lay down any wire on the floor because there will be an exposed section that I am certain will get battered/pulled."
"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","Another option, and one i use for wired ethernet is to get the gigabit power outlet adapters.

"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","I agree with this. If you want to preserve your ceiling/walls. Try one of these , although the speed can depend on your places circuitry layout."
"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?",These adapters intrigue me but is there not an increased risk of damage due to electrical surges?  As in frying the network adapter on the device you're plugging it into?

"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","If your router is in the same room and your devices support 5ghz, that might be much nicer and easier than running an unsightly cable.

"What is the best way to run cords across the room, without them touching the floor?","There are lots of options as many have pointed out so far. How much effort/money do you want to put into making the connection?   On the spendy side you can hire someone to pull a cable(presuming the owner if not you, will allow that) to the location you want the TV, keep in mind you still have to worry about power and stuff.  The budget way to do it is with floor cord covers and clever placement of furniture.The next step up is using Wiremold or something similar hide the wire along the walls.  Usually paintable if you want to hide it better.My best suggest is to make a diagram of the wire layout you want and then plan from that.  Include power, data and any audio cabling you might need.  If you can look ahead a bit and plan for possible future expansion.Alternate suggestion, replace your WiFi router with a better quality one so you can just use WiFi."

It's not gonna look great, but I've seen worse. If you're running multiple cables you can get some spiral cable wrap, that might make it look tidier.I know a guy who just loosely ran his black cables up the wall and across the ceiling with a couple screw in hooks like you would hang a plant, and it looks messy, but even then you stop noticing after a while.As long as you take your time and do your best it shouldn't be a problem."

Vue is reliable and allows 5 streams. FuboTV is good as well, but only allows 2 streams at one time. Both offer TV Everywhere App logins and NFL Network/Red Zone.

Roku Introduces JVC Roku TV,"I'm hoping for a Roku win/crush thing to really start.  Arguably it has already started.  Ideally would love to see the end of ""smart"" TV, but certainly ""Roku TV"" makes more sense than today's ""total lock-in with poor support smart TV""."

Companies stop updating the manufacturer specific apps and you lose access to that app.I prefer to simply buy a Roku device (or similar) and attach it to the TV.

Roku Introduces JVC Roku TV,"I have an Insignia Roku TV that I purchased a few months ago, and for the price I think it was a good value. My only complaint is that the Roku part of it is a little crashy, but at the same time it was only like a $200 set and I haven't had the need to hook up or buy anything extra for it because of the integrated Roku. If I were going for a more expensive set, I'm not sure I would want the integrated Roku -- I think I'd rather go with just the highest quality set and get a settop box like Apple TV 4k or the better Roku box."
Roku Introduces JVC Roku TV,"4K Roku TVs have hardware on par with the Roku Ultra. All of my 4K TCLs have been fast and stable.

“Are You Afraid of the Dark?” and “AAAHH!!! Real Monsters” Part of Nickelodeon’s New OTT Streaming Service,"ROTATING tap of content?  What a load of bull.  For $5.99 a month, they can keep adding content and maintain library titles.  This is what I fear Disney Play will become.

“Are You Afraid of the Dark?” and “AAAHH!!! Real Monsters” Part of Nickelodeon’s New OTT Streaming Service,">you will never have the option to watch all 17 every month.Probably not a popular opinion here, but they *do* have that option. If you want to have perpetual access to a movie, you should just buy it. The likelihood that Disney will make the entire infrastructure of selling $20-30 DVDs, digital movies, Blu-rays, and 4K Blu-rays completely worthless by offering an expensive streaming service that gives you all the same content at a much lower price is a pipe dream.I love Netflix and other streaming services for the wealth of provided content I'm unfamiliar with, but if there's something I know I have to have access to I'm not going to get rid of my physical copy of it just because it's *currently* available to stream somewhere."
“Are You Afraid of the Dark?” and “AAAHH!!! Real Monsters” Part of Nickelodeon’s New OTT Streaming Service,"VRV being even more bang for my buck is great news! The rotating library is a bit of a bummer, but for $10 a month VRV is great for niche content."

Need antenna help...,"If you want most of the channels a cable replacement will provide, you need to determine what channels you must have and look at PlayStation Vue, Direct TV Now, Sling, Philo and others online streaming services see which will fill the gap between the local channels you might be able to get with an antenna.  You may find that those services already have those channels that your would get via the antenna and that an antenna just isn't needed... Just a good internet service with a streaming device.

"So I've got this old DirectTV amplifier and am currently using a ClearStream 2Max, do you think it'd be beneficial/detrimental to throw the amp to the antenna?",The picture is of a 21 volt power inserter and not an amplifer.

Suggestion on what to subscribe on.,"FuboTV has what you want. As far as Serie A games go, a new rights deal was signed with ESPN Plus (a $4.99 a month service).

Suggestion on what to subscribe on.,"Cheapest option would be Sling TV Blue + Lifestyle Extra + Best of Spanish TV Extra + Cloud DVR, for $40/mo. That gets you everything on your list except HBO, Telemundo, and Univision, and gives you a 50 hour Cloud DVR with maybe some restricted ad skipping.Next cheapest is fuboTV at $45/mo, gets you everything but HBO, though Univision and Telemundo availability might vary by region. Includes a 30 hour Cloud DVR ~~with no ad skipping~~. Extra $10/mo gets you their ""Advanced DVR"" with 500 hours of storage. Recordings will always be the whole show even if you press record half-way through the broadcast.For both of the above, you can get HBO Now separately for $15/mo, which will get you all HBO content via the HBO Now app.Also note that max resolution depends on the source channel, which sometimes maxes out at 720p, and your internet connection(fuboTV recommends 20Mbps for their best quality). [fuboTV is doing some testing of 4K](https://support.fubo.tv/hc/en-us/articles/360011479911-Does-fuboTV-offer-any-content-in-4K-HDR-) but its device and channel support is currently limited."

Getting Around Landline Service to Alarm,Many of the major home alarm companies offer cellular add-on modules that stick right into the main unit.
Getting Around Landline Service to Alarm,"Cellular is a good option if provider supports it. There are also modules like Envisalink’s that will link into the alarm’s bus and provide IP-based access for your alarm central station. I have one of these on my DSC system. If you’re under contract to one of the big boys this is not likely an option, but if you’re out of your contract and willing to do some DIY might be worth your while. "
Getting Around Landline Service to Alarm,"I thought almost everything runs on cellular now. When I had Xfinity Home it was cellular and all the self-monitoring options I investigated to replace it offered some level of cellular based monitoring.I do use Ooma to keep a ""land line"" and before that I was on Xfinity for years so I don't know the last time I had a line provided by the telco but I'm guessing it was 10 years ago."

"Amazon reportedly planning a free, ad-supported video service for Fire TV owners","Interesting. I have't been taken by any Amazon Originals and would likely keep my Prime subscription regardless for shipping, but I am interested in companies that have been subscription exclusive models branching out into alternative ad-supported models, so long as subscribers still maintain ad-free access. Though I'm not sure how I feel about it being linked to Fire TV purchases, since you are in that case paying a fee to watch ad based content similar to current TV. Though I guess it would be cheaper than cable (though with much less content) in the long run depending on how long you keep your TVs"
"Amazon reportedly planning a free, ad-supported video service for Fire TV owners",It is kind of like the Kindle Owners' Lending library for books.

Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"I'm an old ReplayTV user and still use them. You hafta be an archaeological worker to keep then running - but still nothing like it. Advantage to you? You probably could find one  for free :)Have been pleasantly surprised by a Thinkpad 420 equipped with 2ea SSDs though. Just solid. NextPVR + 8ea OTA Homerun tuners. Everything dumps to an SSD where they are picked off by popcorn network media players. The media players (like all media players) are buggy, but the video chip they used is nice.Did install an external squirrel cage laptop cooler from the beginning...so really have no idea how hot it runs. Believe with 10 channels being recorded CPU was at 50% on this I5 box. Can live with it.Had really dreaded deviating from those Replays...but it worked out.The reason it is so difficult for you to find a simple recorder is because the industry wants it that way."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"Oh man, I haven't heard ReplayTV in a Loooong time.  You made me nostalgic and I went to go see if anything is still going on with them.  It's sad to see all the old forums where people spent years trying to figure out how to keep them around after the switch to HD television.  People were arguing with each other over whether or not HD was even all that good, talking about how close to HD Replay was if they recorded through the S-Video port and letterboxed everything. One person said that HD was a fad that would go away bc we'd never be able to record very much in HD due to the size requirements, lol.  They were a very dedicated bunch.  About the last post I saw in the AVS forums was in 2010 from someone replying to the last conversation that ended in 2007. He was still hanging on. To my surprise there are still a couple companies providing program guide data specifically for ReplayTV people. >Have been pleasantly surprised by a Thinkpad 420 equipped with 2ea SSDs though. Just solid. NextPVR + 8ea OTA Homerun tuners. Everything dumps to an SSD where they are picked off by popcorn network media players. The media players (like all media players) are buggy, but the video chip they used is nice.That's quite a setup! It's amazing that little Thinkpad can handle that many simultaneous streams and only use half the CPU!>The reason it is so difficult for you to find a simple recorder is because the industry wants it that way.That is the truth.  Replay caught tons of flack over the commercial skipping and it was super easy to move recordings off it. Even Tivo had their own problems for making it too easy to skip over commercials. It's never been as easy since those days to just watch TV without hassles."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"I have a Stream+ and a HDhomerun Duo. The Stream+ is pretty good. You can side load both Netflix and Prime. Netflix took over a year to approve the same device used in Australia by Foxtel for streaming only; they have changed how freely they give their streaming rights out now that they are dominant in the market. There is an active beta group for Google Live Channels and there is the promise to reveal the full 14 day guide (right now it's there, but you can only see 48 hours). The main disadvantage is you cannot start to record a program and then start watching the recording in delay mode (""chase play""). You can also use the HDhomerun app as a channel input so the channels are integrated with your other sources like Pluto TV.Some people are using the hard drive attached to the S+  as the storage for the HDHR $35 a year DVR. That's been problematic for me as it keeps disconnecting the drive if the internet goes down.The HDHR DVR works well and stores the files as regular mp4 files. But it has a weird 14 day guide that is a little quirky. I'm learning to like it, though. Amazon is rumored to have a OTA DVR coming that is code named Frank. Maybe they will get it right."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,Do you have a link for information on sideloading netflix and amazon? That is my biggest complaint with the stream+
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,">You can also use the HDhomerun app as a channel input so the channels are integrated with your other sources like Pluto TV.What is the best use for a feature like this?  As I understand the way Live Channels works on the Stream+ you can also just get your OTA channels directly on the Stream+ and integrate the same channels into the Live Channels guide with PlutoTV, too? I think I'm missing something.>Amazon is rumored to have a OTA DVR coming that is code named Frank. Maybe they will get it right.I read a leak about that recently. If Amazon uses their leverage to get some agreements from various streaming television providers to allow their guides to be fully integrated into a single channel program guide that includes all the OTA channels (if someone subscribes to one of those providers) and creates a device with at least 2 tuners and the ability to pair multiple devices together then they could hit a home-run.  They have the ability, I'm just concerned their interest is mostly in selling videos and their own season-pass subscriptions. I am anxious to see what they come up with, though.  A little off-topic, but I'd like to see a DVR maker with clout follow Sling's lead with a more agnostic and open framework and pressure all the streaming providers to make their guides available for integration based on what their subscribers are receiving. Sling is really on track with the AirTV/AirTV Player concept.  They're the first streaming service provider to have integrated their channel guide with anything else at all. Integrating over-the-air free channels from antennas with their own streaming service, inside the same grid-based channel guide, has taken far too long. No one wants to switch back and forth from a ""OTA channels app"" to a ""SlingTV app"" anytime they want to go between seeing what's on AMC and what's on their local PBS affiliate or sub-channels. It shouldn't make a difference whether we are getting our channels from a streaming service provider or an antenna -- they should just all be placed inside a single program guide with 14-day program data and DVR ability regardless. I wish more providers had followed Google's lead with the Live Channels option that they made available. It's there just waiting to be used by any provider that wants to do the same thing.I read the other day that it costs a cable provider between $10-$15/mo for ever single subscriber just to pay the ""re-transmission fees"" to give their subscribers the local over the air stations that are floating around in the air for free. Maybe it's a little less for streaming providers, but it's wasteful.  If more people could get OTA through an antenna integrated with subscribed streaming channels in the same guide then it would reduce the demand and those re-transmission fees would start to go down or more providers would just decide they don't need to do it anymore at all and prices could come down on streaming packages."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"While you summed up the options very nicely, you fell victim to the very thing that bugs you about other write-ups: recency.HDHomeRun now offers the same complementary OTT streaming service that you described for Sling AirTV. Cable EPG and DVR is now fully integrated and is ready for 3rd party DVRs like Plex to be updated to pick up the content.I was just checking out the demo a few minutes ago. I'm amazed that it works with a Connect Duo. They let you watch the cable channels for a few minutes and then punt you into a slick, highly produced ad for the service. It reminded me of the channel that would only show up on hacked Dish Network receivers where they would urge you to sign up or face significant jail time. That being said, their lineup for $5 less than a grandfathered DTVN Go Big doesn't even come close. $35 for 45 channels vs $40 for 120 channels. "
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"As someone who binge watches, I like the idea of local dvr but without BBC America or Disney XD, I'm not switching from PS Vue. If they expanded their channel selections, I'd buy a HDHR and sign up for their OTT.  For now, my Rokus, Tablo TV and Vue work pretty well together.  "
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"I have a 4-tuner Tablo. The lifetime subscription is account based so you can transfer it if you replace/upgrade your Tablo in the future.There are programs for ripping your recordings from the Tablo, so you can at least archive those onto a Plex/Emby server if you wanted to. As for third-party app support for live streams, it's a shame there isn't any, but with Tablo being on most devices/platforms already it's not a big deal.Loading channels is slow due to the transcoding and buffering, but I'm already used to VOD so I just skim through the guide or show listings to find things to watch/record.Image quality is fine, especially if you choose a higher quality option in the settings and 5.1 audio support was recently added, although there are compatibility issues that need to be taken into account if you want to use it.As I said before, yeah you'll have to replace your Tablo when ATSC3.0 finally rolls out, but that will still take years, and your lifetime subscription will carry over.I haven't had any regular network issues. A few minor hiccups but nothing major or repeated.My one big criticism is with the Web/Mobile apps. They cache all the guide data locally, so if you have a ton of channels like I do, it takes *forever* for them to sync for the first time. And if you don't open the apps for a week or so, you'll probably be stuck waiting a while for it to load as well. Also the Roku channel still doesn't support out of home streaming."

FYI - We're doing some significant API work right now to stick a fork in the sync requirement for the web apps. "
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,">The lifetime subscription is account based so you can transfer it if you replace/upgrade your Tablo in the future.That is definitely a nice thing to keep in mind. With Tivo, for example, it's tied to the device.>There are programs for ripping your recordings from the Tablo, so you can at least archive those onto a Plex/Emby server if you wanted to.Good to know.  Is there currently a way to easily remove or skip over commercials on your recorded content?  I know Tivo is a piece of cake, and with several HDHR solutions (both free and paid) there are easy ways to get past commercials.>Image quality is fine, especially if you choose a higher quality option in the settings and 5.1 audio support was recently added, although there are compatibility issues that need to be taken into account if you want to use it.I read something recently that the high-quality setting is a little wonky.  Especially so w/ a 4-tuner Tablo where one tuner won't record at the same quality as the other 3 if they're all recording simultaneously.  Are you running the Tablo at the highest-quality setting and if so, have you been able to notice any issues at that setting?>I haven't had any regular network issues. A few minor hiccups but nothing major or repeated.This is encouraging.  Are you running it over ethernet or wifi?>They cache all the guide data locally, so if you have a ton of channels like I do, it takes forever for them to sync for the first time. And if you don't open the apps for a week or so, you'll probably be stuck waiting a while for it to load as well.If that's your biggest gripe, that's really pretty good overall. I doubt I would use the Tablo over my phone all that much anyway.  I barely ever used the Dish Anywhere app the whole time I was with Dish and it was really fast and well-made."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"It's been a couple of years but if you have an old PC around (or buy an off-lease one) you could run NextPVR and Plex to push the recordings out to TVs. Without a Plex Pass, you'd still need an antenna for live tv on units not hooked directly to the PC and the Plex would just be for recording but both the NextPVR software and Plex are free. All you'd have was the hardware cost and you don't need a powerful PC for the recordings. Or you could just buy a plex pass and use that as the back-end as well avoiding the need for NextPVR entirely. "
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"I have Plex running off my Nvidia Shield. With the beta and Plex pass  gets a 14 day grid guide.It does take a couple of seconds to channel surf. You can always use the Live Channels app or the Hdhomerun app.  If your really into the least amount of delay vs what OTA direct brings you, Live Channels os the way to go. It is maybe 1 second behind the OTA broadcast. This is followed by Hdhomerun which is a couple of seconds behind and Plex is even farther behind.So don't channel surf with Plex as you will hate it.I use it for the DVR."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"That's good info. Do you run it off the shield just with internal 500gb drive or are you using it off the external storage?Also, which app is better overall, Live Channels or the HDHR app?"
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"On the TiVo front - you should never say never...but I have a really hard time seeing them adding in true OTT apps into their ecosystem.  It would cut directly across their primary reason for existence (customers paying for monthly cable service, and in turn paying for TiVo's monthly guide fees).  I say this as a 20+ year TiVo user and someone who adores what TiVo brought to the table, but understands that it is almost time for the old lady to bow out."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,"Yes, I can see that. I had just about forgotten that the majority of their business was from paying cable subscribers.  I could see them having a smaller business going forward in the OTA/Antenna market that likes to supplement their antenna some parts of the year with cable streaming services like Sling.  The new Roamio VOX OTA 1TB is pretty darn close to a perfect device for people who have ditched cable. They're for sale right now for $349 w/ Lifetime guide data, includes voice remote, antenna hookup, has Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Youtube, Vudu, Pandora, HBO, Hulu (regular, not Live), and some other apps.  Sadly, though, without a SlingTV or other cable streaming app it isn't quite perfect.  It's also pretty expensive if you need it on more than 1 TV.  That requires buying a mini Vox for $180/TV which is like buying an nVidia Shield for every TV. For only 1 TV though, it's a great solution that's *almost* perfect.All of these devices with built-in tuners, including Tivo, are going to be obsolete in a few years once ATSC 3.0 begins rolling out nationally.  They will be usable for a maximum of 5 years after the national roll-out since stations will be required to continue broadcasting in ATSC 2.0, but it's still borrowed time. That's probably the most appealing thing about going with a Tablo. The hardware will be obsolete and abandoned the same time as all the Tivos, but *if* Tablo is still around and *if* DVRs are even a thing after ATSC 3.0 (which allows broadcasters to encode a no-record code if they want) then the lifetime subscription paid to Tablo will follow a person when they purchase a new device."
Seeking your recent opinions on the latest DVR solutions:,Not sure why Tivo doesn't team up with DTVN and VUE to be the go to box for those services and offer what HDHomeRun just did with their own service.
"I bought a modem, so do I need a router also?","Definitely gonna need a newer router, because B is not sufficient enough for today’s internet needs. An N router would be okay, but ultimately not last very long. Go ahead and get an AC powered router and you’ll be good for a few years. "
"I bought a modem, so do I need a router also?","If you don't care about wireless speeds, it will work for up to 54Mbps via wireless, or 100 Mbps via wired, (closer to 87 Mbps).  I have a Linksys WRT54g, a Linksys E1000 v 2.1, and my newest purchase of a Netgear 3650 AC1750.  The WRT54g and E1000 while perfectly servicable for a slower connection, are simply not able to keep up with 100/10 service, let alone 400/20.  If you don't care much about throughput and subscribe to the cheapest plan, (100/10), then it will ""work"", but your performance won't be very adequate.  I'd get a newer router so you can actually use all of your bandwith.  (yes, I kept my old routers, and even my old Motorola SB5101U from 2005, they still work, and will provide an ""emergency"" internet connection up to 25/2, but they are by far not my primary units that I use)"
"I bought a modem, so do I need a router also?","Your Zoom 5345 modem does not appear to have built-in wireless capabilities, so yes, you will need a separate router if you want to your devices to connect wirelessly. I would recommend buying a new router, as your “B” router is very outdated and your Rokus and other devices will probably not be able to stream video very well from it. You should look for an “AC” router, the current standard. You would plug a cable between the router’s “WAN” or “internet” port (usually yellow) and the modem’s yellow LAN port to get the internet signal from the modem to the router. If your House has LAN cables already installed between rooms, you should be able to use them by plugging them into other ports on your router. Most routers come with four wired ports available so you could plug those cables into any of the free ports."
"I bought a modem, so do I need a router also?","Thanks for the great info. I now have a Belkin N450 DB - model #f9k1105v2 that looks fairly current, used on campus 2-3 yrs ago. Do you know if there is any effort needed on my part after my modem is cabled upby the installer? Do I need to go into the modem and do anything beyond attaching the router or will the installer get us up and going initially? Thanks again for the easy to understand info."

Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,I receive one of those ads in the mail about once per week. Have not tried it but curious to hear from those that have. 
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,If I try it I'll post about it. 
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"I have it. The selection and price work great, but honestly... I don't like the service.No chromecast.Need a Samsung smartTV to use their ""app"" and it is horrendous. 30 second minimum to go to the next channel.You can not change your selected channels. Like, ever. You're locked in once you sign up. Choose wisely.Can not use off of your home network. No TV on the go. You can only use it on your phone, tablet or computer at home, but you can't cast to your TV unless you want to screen cast. Then you can't use your phone and watch TV at the same time.I'm currently deciding if I want to go back to Vue, Hulu, or YouTube. Until Spectrum adds value to their platform, stay away. "
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"Me too, mine go right in the trash. "
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"I'm pretty sure after the taxes and ""fees"" it works out to closer to 30 bucks a month. It worked well, but not worth it to me when all I want is locals."
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"Thanks for replying.  If it is 30 month, then I'm not going to buy it. I'll give the free week a try starting this weekend. "
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"There were some reviews on here somewhere from some people who have tried it.  There are definitely taxes/fees, and so your total price would be higher than you see.   If you cannot get locals any other way then I can see possibly doing it.   But for those who get locals OTA, I'm not sure how much value there would be.  Let us know what you do and if you try it leave a review if you can."
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,Is there a special URL for this/is it only in certain areas right now? A quick google search turned up nothing as far as how to sign up.&#x200B;
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,https://www.spectrum.com/streamtv.html
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"If you have Spectrum/TWC promo internet pricing, that goes away as soon as you sign on!"
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,I think this is the plan that causes you to lose any existing promo rates for your internet if you cancel it. 
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,It doesn't if the internet deal was preexisting.    I had signed up for Choice and then canceled and kept my internet deal.  Then I tried Stream because it had the channels I needed. I just canceled that and  I still keep my internet price at $45.  I only had it because Hulu Live didn't have all of my locals but they got them a couple weeks ago so I am going that route for the DVR and better on Demand and an Apple TV app. With the upcoming deal with Apple I may revisit Spectrum Stream. It really is good for the price.
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"How many channels total?I know spectrum charges a rental fee of $5 or $8 per box in addition to their base price. Also, the $21.99 is a lure to raise rates later, likely before the 2-years. But try it out and let us know.  "
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,This is strictly over the top using their app only so you wont need to rent a box or need any install kit. You get locals plus any 10 additional channels to choose from a pot to pick from.
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,What quality? Don’t forget cable compresses the hell out of the signals. Hard to beat OTA for picture quality!
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"In all honesty it is the best picture I have seen from any of these streaming cable services (I have used them all).  I ultimately decided on Hulu Live for the VOD and the features.  If Spectrum can get their app on more devices, Roku, Xbox, and Samsung TV are only supported now Apple TV is coming this fall, and if they add a cloud DVR then I will revisit them as the picture quality was fantastic. "
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,"I had it then cancelled it. It is closer to $30 than $20 all said and done, however I don't recall the exact price. My biggest complaint though was that it was pretty much useless away from home. I couldn't get any locals unless I was using my Charter WiFi. A number of other channels were disabled outside of the home network as well."
Spectrum TV Stream $21.99,Was it difficult to cancel?

Question on HDhomerun,"See https://kb.netgear.com/23991/What-are-the-LEDs-and-ports-on-the-front-panel-of-my-Nighthawk-router-calledAny equipment that is wired into the router’s 4 Ethernet ports will show either a white light (meaning the connected device is capable of Gigabit speed) or an amber light (meaning the connected device is not capable of Gigabit speed). The HDHomeRun Connect Duo only supports 100BaseT, so it doesn’t support gigabit speed and your router displays an amber light on the corresponding Ethernet port. Your setup is fine. I have the HDHomeRun Connect Duo and using the Channels app on the Apple TV, and it works great. "
Question on HDhomerun,"That’s good, solid advice!, thanks!, I checked the HDHomeRun site and did see the 100BaseT info. I’m satisfied with your comment that I’m ok with my setup. Seems like I can’t leave technical stuff alone, gotta keep tweaking:). It’s my curse:)...thanks again!"
Question on HDhomerun,"It’s digital, you have it or you don’t as long as the picture doesn’t pixelate you’re fine."
Question on HDhomerun,"Thanks!!!, I really appreciate the advice. I’m “good to go” :)"
Question on HDhomerun,"If I’m reading correctly, there shouldn’t be different lights for wired connections since they don’t have different bands just connected or not connected afaik. I use a Tablo for my locals because they had a native app for Apple TV and do a wired connection it’s great. "

NickSplat SVOD Channel From Nickelodeon Launches On VRV,Guess I'll be joining VRV again
NickSplat SVOD Channel From Nickelodeon Launches On VRV,Huh never heard of VRV. Looks interesting. 
NickSplat SVOD Channel From Nickelodeon Launches On VRV,"People mainly sub for the anime. After looking through their offerings for NickSplat, it's severely underwhelming. 300 episodes amongst 30 shows. Missing plenty of seasons. Some of the shows listed are already available on Hulu with complete seasons."
NickSplat SVOD Channel From Nickelodeon Launches On VRV,I believe it has the Stargate Origins short form video series - its a prequel to SG-1. It has actually has an interesting bundle of services. 
NickSplat SVOD Channel From Nickelodeon Launches On VRV,Its for sure worth it. However I am upset it is missing some stuff from Nick. Especially rocket power which is fucking in the VRV ads but not the app
Getting a cablecard from cable america?,"This is all I could find on their site: http://www.cableamerica.com/customer-notifications/>Some televisions and devices are sold with a port for a CableCard that can be used in place of a converter box.

Special equipment is available for lease that will enable you to simultaneously watch and record dual scrambled or encrypted signals.Can't remember if they're still required by law to provide CableCards."
Getting a cablecard from cable america?,"Yeah, forgot to mention that bit from the website in my post. My understanding is that they're not required to use cablecards in their own boxes since like 2014, but they're still supposed to provide cablecards to their customers."

Exterior TV Antenna,"Those who complained, probably didn't do the necessary research. This site should help you determine what channels should come in:https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmaps This site will tell you where the towers are located:https://www.antennasdirect.com/transmitter-locator.htmlThis is important info anyone needs before purchasing. I live less than thirty miles from multiple towers, but get no signal because of the terrain. This is why the first site is handy."
Exterior TV Antenna,"Sounds like you did your research on TVfool.com already. That is good. > Does anyone have any first-hand knowledge that they can share as far as an exact make and model?There are so many different options out there. I've read several reviews and watched numerous videos. With all of that, it was very difficult to actually choose ONE. My first option were some rabbit ears. If you have some of those, try them. See if the channels they pickup make you happy. If you'd like more channels or aren't satisfied, try an inexpensive multi-directional antenna to see if you like it.I would try to avoid getting something expensive right off the bat, as you might not like it or need it. I have several inexpensive antennas that have a longgggg cords so it can be placed on or near a window. You can PM for more information or questions. "
Exterior TV Antenna,"Thanks. Yeah I had a bunch of channels on one direction, a bunch in the opposite and 2-4 in between. "
Exterior TV Antenna,"Some people assume they need an omni-directional antenna when they don't. First, you can always mount more than 1 directional antenna. Second, you may be surprised what signals you can pick up from a high-quality directional antenna that isn't even pointed in the right direction to get those signals.The thing about omnidirectional antennas is that they collect a lot of signals, but not very strongly and they're also going to pick up a lot of signals you don't want.  They are more prone to several issues that cause ghosting. So, they're really not an ideal type of antenna. That may be why you're already assuming you might need a pre-amp b/c you already realize you're going to have weaker signals feeding your coax. Omnis can work and they're common in RV applications, but they're not as good as a quality directional antenna.Personally, I would first try a directional high-gain antenna pointed at the majority of the stations and I wouldn't even think about a pre-amp until everything else failed and you don't have to buy an antenna that has one already in it you can always ad one in-line later if needed. You may be surprised at what you'll pick up with a good directional antenna. I was shocked to run a channel scan and find out I was getting ALL of the channels that were behind and to the side of my roof-mounted directional antenna at nearly full-strength! [I got the RCA Yagi](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Compact-Outdoor-Antenna-Range/dp/B0024R4B5C).Once you've tried a directional antenna, then, if there are still a few more off in another direction that you need to grab, just buy another directional antenna and mount it to the same mast, but point it the other direction toward the other stations.  Then all you have to do is take a bi-directional 2-way splitter (also called a combiner) and install it backwards so that the coax from each antenna is going into each of the ""out"" ports and the main trunk to your home is going out of the ""in"" port.  When you install the antennas on the mast, just try to keep about 4' between them so that one is 4ft higher than the other."
Exterior TV Antenna,I been thinking about getting a move expensive antenna. I been eyeing that  RCA Yagi also as a cheaper alternative. I live about 70 miles from Los Angeles and San Diego towers. I first tried one those cheap knock off 150mile antennas and all it got was sum weird religious and asian infomercials.
Exterior TV Antenna,How strong are those signals that come in from all around you? If they are weak an omnidirectional won't work.
Exterior TV Antenna,Thanks everyone

Hulu Live or YouTube TV,[deleted]
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,I think the OP is referring to it not having the base back catalog of VOD that Hulu gives you in addition to the VOD you get with the Live TV.
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,I just looked on that subreddit and there's nothing but complaints on there about YouTube TV!!
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"I recently made the switch and went with Hulu Live TV. It is $3 more a month ($43 vs YouTube TV's $40), but you receive a few more channels and have their extensive on demand and Hulu Originals catalog.Edited to add - it's easier to switch between live tv and non live material this way too, since you don't need to be switching apps. It's a simple but significant advantage. "
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,This is a huge plus in the Hulu column.
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,You must have the limited commericals add on as Hulu Live is $39.99 a month without the limited commericals add on. 
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"Hulu Live is way better than YouTubeTV., and I’ve used them both.  Hulu’s on demand library dwarfs YouTube TV."
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"If you plan on having regular Hulu. I'd say go with Hulu. That's cheaper, for the missing channels like Discovery networks. Philo is only 16 or 20. "
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,Can't really go wrong with either since they offer pretty similar experiences. I'd say if you currently sub to Hulu or were thinking about it then I'd probably go that route and do Hulu Live. Since they include their entire library with the live tv service you'll end up paying less than YTTV.
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"I ended up going with YouTube TV.  I searched reddit for the same topic and everyone was choosing YouTube and hated the hulu layout.  Because I can DVR everything, and probably download the rest, YouTube should work.  I have already edited the live channel guide to put all the sports at the bottom so its basically categorized.  I just wish the discovery channel was on YouTube.  It's really the only thing missing.  My guilty pleasure, Gold Rush, will be back on in a couple months, lol."
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"How old was that thread? I know Hulu made some improvements last month (?) that fixed a lot of the issues people weren't happy with.You'll like YTTV though, I really enjoyed my trial with it. As far as Gold Rush goes, I would just wait til the end of the season and do a free trial of one of the services that has Discovery and binge the whole season during that week. But I'm pathetic and cheap so..."
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"I have Hulu Live with HBO Showtime & Cinemax add ons. I’ve have Hulu Live itself since the service first rolled out. It’s come a long way & improved a lot compared to when it launched. I consider it very reliable. I like being able to jump into a show or movie on the Live TV service, then rewinding to the beginning to watch from the start. That’s pretty gnarly.  Now I’m remembering I need to cancel 2 of the Premium add ons because we don’t watch them at all. "
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"I've had Hulu live TV for about nine months now. The overall experience now versus what it was even three months ago is night and day. Very few hangups, very little buffering, video quality is nearly perfect. If you add in their base plan and their limited commercials the total comes out to about $43/month. Much more bang for your buck in my opinion."
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,YouTube TV all the way. It does have on demand. Select the channel by pressing left and then OK. Hulu Live doesn't work on the Nvidia Shield or any Android TV devices. I had to subscribe before finding that out the hard way. https://www.androidheadlines.com/2018/02/android-tv-hulu-live-tv-not-coming-due-to-lack-of-platform-users.html
Hulu Live or YouTube TV,"I have Hulu Live on my Samsung tv, my samsung phone, my Roku,my 43 inch LG tv, and Amazon Fire stick which is also Android.   Maybe because that article was written in February, but as of right now my Android devices play Hulu live."

You will need to monitor your usage the first few months to know if you're close to going over the cap and incurring additional fees. You can usually do this when logged into your Internet provider's website.Check out AT&T's [data estimator](https://www.att.com/esupport/data-calculator/index.jsp). Ignore everything except the hours spent streaming SD/HD/4K video. All other things you'll do on the Internet are trivial compared to streaming video.Think about how many hours of TV you watch per day, then calculate the total for a month, and adjust the calculator. For example, 3 hours of HD video per night is 90 hours per month which the estimator says is 225 GB needed for the month.In contrast, [Netflix says](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87) 1 hour of HD video uses up to 3 GB per hour. 3 GB x 90 hours = 270 GB per month. Of course, Netflix used the qualifier 'up to.'If you're only streaming Netflix, then hurrah, because Netflix will let you downgrade your stream to 'medium' and 'low' quality to save on your data usage.  A medium stream only uses 0.7 GB per hour and is tolerable.Most other streaming services do not let you downgrade your data stream. But if you use a Roku box, you can throttle all streaming via a secret menu."

You could think of mbps as time (it stands for megabits per second (not megabytes!)). Basically, If you have a little bit of patience slow internet is fine, and most of today’s websites are designed to adapt to varying internet speeds, like being able to choose what quality/resolution you want your YouTube video to play at. Big files, like high quality/resolution (hd/4K) video and pictures take more time to download. So choosing what speed works for you depends on your interests/habits ie what sites you visit. If all you do is browse reddit, slow internet like 1-10mbps would be good enough albeit pictures might load slower, and video from sites like YouTube and Netflix will be played at lower quality for longer as it buffers. But if you watch live hd video from sites like slingtv or twitch you will want 25+mbps so you can watch 720/1080/4K, or if you download huge files like digital video games for Xbox/ps4/Steam you will want as much mbps you can get to be able to play asap."

Need help choosing a new router to buy,"Are the issues only on WiFi?N300 is a pretty old router, I have the same modem with 70Mbps Comcast service and have no issues.That router does 802.11n which is older generation WiFi. It should give you 300+ Mbps in ""ideal"" conditions. Unfortunately, it is 2.4Ghz only, which suffers from interference from neighbor's WiFi, microwaves, radar, wireless phones, bluetooth and wireless keyboards and mice, etc.Most interference can be overcome by adjusting the channels used for WiFi, out of the box most use channel 6 and most people don't take the time to change it. If you try channel 1 or 11, it should help reduce interference.But, if the problems persist, a new router might be wise, one that does 802.11ac with the 5Ghz band.

I have 98GB left. Afraid I'll go over my cap. Help?,"The month I did a trial for DTVN, i had the highest data usage I have ever had even compared to extensive binge-watching on Netflix and Hulu. I am sure it is worse with multiple users.  Here are some suggestions. YMMV.1. Make sure that you completely log out of any apps/channels on any streaming device. (Note that they will update whenever they are on too so you may want to unplug them. Don't shut off the tv while in the app or channel, exit it to the home screen for the device. 2. Don't watch 4K video. Don't download large files or large game purchases. Not sure if gaming uses alot of data, but my guess is that it probably uses more than you think.3. Live streaming services use more data than Netflix and probably Hulu. Avoid using them for the rest of the month. Use an antenna, watch DVDs from the library.4. Don't leave streaming services on if you aren't actually watching them. Don't fall asleep to them. Antenna is a better choice. Remember that streaming music also uses data.5. Try QoS on your router.6. Some services do allow you to set the video quality especially on mobile devices. Live streaming services typically don't.7. Adjust settings for your OS updates, phone updates and for facebook, twitter updates. Anything you can do to minimize how often these happen may help. 8. If you have TMobile or any service that zero rates a streaming service, now is the time to use them. (Disable wifi first).9. Use one of the [on demand services with off line viewing](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/index#wiki_on-demand_services_with_offline_viewing). Use the wifi at your local library or cafe to download onto your tablet or phone. Then watch at home. It is only part of a month...10. If you watch a lot of YouTube videos, you can adjust the video quality settings for that. "

Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,"Why not get an antenna? Unlike a streaming service you won't be using data up.  (There is a possibility of a data cap in your area).Yes, you can use Hulu with Live TV or PS Vue or Philo or any of the other live streaming services as background too. You could also use a music steaming service as well. One is probably on the Samsung TV. Not sure what is available on your model tv. "
Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,> Philo Oh I've never heard of that live TV plan. I'll take a look and compare it to the others. Thanks for the reply as well.We were thinking of antenna but didn't know how well the quality would be. We did TVFool and noticed only two channels were Green and the rest were Yellow. Am I exaggerating it when I believe it means the quality will be subpar? Any particular link to recommend antennas?Luckily our service provider doesn't have a data cap when I just checked as well.
Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,You a need a digital clock to go with your selected noisemaker. Don't forget :)
Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,"Ironically enough, since getting rid of the cable box in the living room my main gripe is we got rid of the clock at the same time. I now want to purchase a cheap digital clock just for telling the time!"
Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,"There are a lot of solutions if you just want to put some TV on as background noise. An antenna is probably the simplest, if you can get OTA reception, and if you want to integrate it with your streaming setup, a Tablo or HDHomeRun will do the job.  Pluto TV also gives you a lot of live streaming channels for free; none of the major networks or anything like that, but a lot of channels of basic stuff you can use for background noise.  On the paid end, yes, Hulu Live would give you what you're looking for.  So would any other live streaming service (Sling, Vue, Fubo, Youtube TV, Philo, etc.)One other thing you might find of interest: search on Netflix for ""Slow TV"".  Each ""episode"" of that is several hours of low-energy content, like a train ride or watching a river.  It's the perfect thing to fall asleep to or use as background noise."
Silence - The Only Thing Plaguing my Family,">search on Netflix for ""Slow TV"".And this is something I'm bringing immediately to my parents!Thanks for the response.

Small-town Ingenuity Is Making Gigabit Broadband a Reality,"While I agree with the overall article, the part about municipal broadband is misleading.  The statement ""And if the 21 states with laws that restrict competition from independent ISPs want to pursue modern economic development strategies to bring greater prosperity to their small towns""should not say ""independent ISP's"".  These laws prohibit deployment of broadband networks similar to the structure of municipal water systems.  I firmly disagree with the laws.  My complaint is that the article does not properly discriminate between independent ISP's and municipal ISP's."
Small-town Ingenuity Is Making Gigabit Broadband a Reality,"That's my quibble with the article as well. It doesn't differentiate between private or even non-profit organizations and the government. Or even quasi-government organizations. There are two possible outcomes that you really have to guard against with government ISPs:* Content restrictions that have to be fought out in court. How quickly will some group claim the city is ""sponsoring"" porn, or hate speech, or not punching Nazis, and sue. How often will those groups win? More often than you think ... look at the fights libraries have over books like Huckleberry Finn.* The same limitations on competition you have now, with the city prohibiting others from providing services because they have to recoup the investment. That leads to lack of innovation and decaying infrastructure. There's probably a solution by having the municipality create the infrastructure and then lease access to providers. I understand that is a model used by some European countries, where the ""pipes"" are public and the services coming through the pipes are from private companies."
Small-town Ingenuity Is Making Gigabit Broadband a Reality,Just need a non-conservative government with leaders and the majority of constituents younger than 40 yo to make this happen.

"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","People subscribe to what they like. Many are saving real money. Most aren't going to sign up for every streaming service known to man (duh). Cord cutting is becoming a trend, but not because it's fashionable. Want to know why? FLEXIBILITY/CHOICE "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","See where the cable companies lose the competitive edge to streaming, is in the set top box fees and taxes etc. The base service prices are roughly a wash. But with $10 per box fees, other misc fees, and tax, That $99/month price jumps to $150/a month. By dropping the cable TV, keeping internet, and getting DirecTV Now, I can watch on multiple TVs, phone, iPad, etc, for $99/month. Streaming services the app is free, no per-device charge."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?",The fees and taxes are why I did it.  Those pissed me off the most.  I still save about 25USD on base price per month but it’s more like 75USD total monthly savings counting those. 
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","Fox sports is available on other live TV streaming services for less money.

"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?",But don’t have the channels that DTVN has. You would need one of those plus Philo to equal the mainstream channels that DTVN has. Hopefully they correct the issues you are having though.

"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I bought an antenna.  Only pay for internet, which is $70/month for symmetrical gigabit fiber.  If a show I want to watch isn't streaming for free somewhere (legally of course), then I wait until it's on DVD and borrow it from the library."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I hate hate and hate posts like this. First of all, they never ever factor in that either way, the OP is paying for internet. Nor do they factor in the taxes, rental fees especially for multiple tvs, broadcast and sports fees and other miscellaneous charges. They also don't factor in many cable tv subscribers still subscribe to Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime. They don't count those in but they do count them on the cordcutter side. Secondly they assume that people want live tv and that they want to recreate cable tv. They also assume people would sign up for everything and also never cancel any service. Especially for channels like HBO, many people only subscribe for less than 6 months a year. They never consider the non-promotional rates. I have been with Comcast a long time, I don't qualify for promo rates. But I don't have a contract and I don't have any ETF to worry about. I cut the cord about seven years ago. I did not have any new subscriber promo pricing at the time - just double internet+tv package. When I cut, I had Performance + basic limited cable tv packages and rented a cable box for a then standard definition tv. It was about $79 to $87 approximately counting fees and taxes. I had no DVR, no on demand, and about eight to 10 channels. Basically I cut the cord because every time Comcast, pushed a group of favorite channels up to a more expensive tier, I had no reason to pay for the existing tier and dropped to a lower one. The first group to go was the then Sci-fi channel (now SyFy). Basic cable tv was frustrating and limited. I got more shopping, Spanish, and religion channels than anything else. I had to pay a fee for sports even though I didn't have ESPN. I had to pay to rent a box. I had taxes. To supplement it, I had to get the Netflix DVD and then later the Netflix streaming service and Hulu. These were each about $8 a piece then. (I have had Prime but I don't think I did before i cut the cord.)  I found I was using these more than the TV. I eventually ran out of tv tiers to cut and the fees were jacked up about another $15 so I cut the cord and dropped down to Performance Starter which was 6/1 then. I still have Performance Starter which is now 15/2. (Not upgrading since they don't sell 25/5 here). The price has gone up a bit I think in seven years but all internet plans have.I value on demand more than live tv. I have absolutely no interest in recreating the cable tv I had. If I were to, it would consist of an antenna, some roku channels for shopping and religion and the CSPAN website because literally that is what I had. And I am more interested in shows not channels so recreating something others had doesn't really make sense to me. Currently:* Internet: I pay $49.99 (non promo rate) for Performance Starter and $0 for taxes. I own my own modem so no rental fees.(I would still pay for internet but I wouldn't be allowed to keep this plan, i would have to pay for a more expensive faster plan). I have no data cap but even if I did, I use nowhere near most data caps. * Hulu: My plan is $7.99 but my $5.99 promo rate was just renewed. No taxes. * CBS All Access: I currently am not subscribed but when I do sign up again for the winter it will be $5.99. I rotate between services because some like CBS don't have new episodes in the summer. This is something I cannot do with cable tv. * Antenna. Free to watch. i paid about $35 for the Winegard Flatwave antenna about 5 or so years ago. I currently get over 25 channels or sub-channels although I probably only watch about 6 or 7 regularly. I don't use a DVR.* Hoopla Digital, Vudu Movies on Us, TubiTV, Roku Channel, NewsON, PBS, CBS News, YouTube, etc. Tons of movies and shows and videos. The DVD collection at my public library. All free $0. So my current monthly cost, assuming I am actually subscribed to CBS All Access is: $49.99 + $5.99 + $5.99 = **$61.97.** So this is actually still less than what I paid for cable tv and I still have more shows and movies than I did then. (There is no $10 plan for Hulu, it is $7.99 or $11.99 for no ads)"
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I believe that cord cutting is gaining momentum because traditional cable/satellite isn't needed in most cases to watch sports. I get my favorite sports via streaming (MMA, MLB, NBA, NFL, and the NHL). "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?",I’ve saved more than $80 a month dropping Directv for a cut cord (with DTV Now ironically). My internet didn’t increase. I was already paying for Amazon and Netflix but I was also paying $160 a month for DTV on 4 sets with DVR and HD upgrade fees.  Not paying $10-15 per TV really makes a difference. 
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I pay $70 a month for 1000/1000 internet, $4.17 a month for Amazon, and $12 a month for Netflix.    My last cable bill was over $200.  I have an antenna for sports.  I find I don’t actually watch that much tv anymore which is a good thing."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I honestly am not saving that much money.  However, I'm getting more in return.  More of the stuff I want to watch, higher quality content versus what was on my lower tier cable plan, plus all the benefits of Amazon prime.  Also, most people have Netflix and/or Prime in addition to cable, not instead of.  So cutting the cord for them represents a bigger overall savings than if they were replacing cable with streaming services. "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","Well, Netflix, Prime and Hulu don’t come with any cable subscription so I’m not sure why they are even in the discussion. Buy one...buy all 3...rotate between them a few months at a time. Really has no bearing on the cost of getting ESPN, USA, FX, HGTV and others. And I say that as a poster who often warns people cord cutting may not turn out as well as they hope. If a cable bundle is cheaper than Internet alone plus Vue/YTTV, etc., go for it."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I’m saving for sure. I was already paying for internet and Netflix, all I added was Hulu with no commercials. So essentially, I was paying $110 for actual Directv, now I’ve switched to Directv Now, which runs me $40 and $12 for Hulu. That’s a savings of roughly $55-$60 a month. "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I cut the cord two years ago and in that time my internet service jumped $20 and my streaming service is up $15 for a total now of $115 per month. When I quit Uverse I was $180 per month. Our premium services, Netflix, hulu, and Prime carried over. So far better television ( imho) and still much less costly. This works for me."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I work in IT and work from home a lot. I have 1Gb fiber from AT&T. I do not consider internet as part of my cord cutting, I would have 1Gb service from AT&T regardless of cable or satellite.I have Amazon Prime for shopping, SVOD is a bonus.I have Netflix ans Hulu, still had Netflix and Hulu when I had XFinity for TV.So the only difference for me was going from 100+ a month for XFinity and HDDVR and fees for 4 TVs to YTTV (35$) and Philo (16). I save over 50 a month and I don't have 100 channels of crap from Cable."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","Our package went from $150/month with internet and a single HDDVR box to $80/month with lower tier internet and youtubetv.  We get all locals via yttv and have a $10 antenna (that we already owned) for just in case. We had Amazon, Netflix, and sometimes Hulu for years so those are not extra costs. We bought one Roku to replace the cable box, the savings the first month paid for that. Already had the other Roku  since we have no smart TVs and had to use Roku after the cable company cut clear QAM. "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","The answer is, it depends on the individual. Reading posts on this forum, it seems that most people have saved real money but cutting the cord. I know that I have, but the amount differs for each individual due to where they live, the availability or over-the-air antenna signals, the ISPs in the area, etc.There was a post here the other day where someone cut cable and ended up paying exactly the same afterwards. It can happen if you aren’t careful.I’m your post OP, I think that many people already had Amazon Prime and Netflix or Hulu AND cable. So adding those services into the equation can be tricky."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?",i honestly cut the cord because i was tired of paying for DVR and cables boxes. I used the DVR less and less and the boxes use tons of power even when off. i checked with a kill-a-watt.I'm saving at least 60 a month by cutting the cord.
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","We have Netflix because we all like it, Prime because we have a TON of stuff shipped from Amazon.  I'm lucky because work pays for internet, but the basic package, which is plenty for us, is like $75 if you aren't bundling.     Combining all that, we currently pay a little over $200.   When we have cable it was over $300 and we rarely watched it.    It depends on what you want.   I'm sure for a lot of people Cable can be the cheaper way to go..."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","We're saving over $75 per month from the last bill which was about two and a half years ago, and cable has raised rates and fees every year so we're obviously saving even more than that now.   We had Netflix and Amazon prior to cutting the cord, and so our only new addition was to add Hulu no commercials plan, and we use PS Vue Elite plan.   Best of all we don't have to do the annual negotiation to keep a lower rate, and we don't have the crappy equipment in our home.  Also, we have more to watch than we could ever hope to do so, and we have not missed one single sporting event we've wanted to watch.  Also, after spending this spring and summer trying out all the other streaming services to see how they compare, we'll likely use Philo instead of Vue for months outside football season and March Madness, and we'll save even more.   That flexibility is something you also don't have with cable.  "
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","(Meh) In the early 80's cable was a steal - even with it's hefty price (wasn't cheap then either). Buy any television, hook it up - it worked. Plenty of new movies and no set top boxes.Somewhere along the line, cable and Hollywood declared war on us. The nuisance of boxes, and fees, then larded bills with no real programming content.IMO, streaming didn't kill cable. Nor did the improvements in broadcast television. Cable (and Hollywood) would still be fighting a losing battle against people deciding ""Keep it"".It's the cost, and the bother. They just aren't as important as they thought they were.Once people make that jump - it's difficult to go back. Probably won't happen. No matter the incentives offered.I guess there are some who attempt to recreate that which was thrown away. Doing that might get expensive. More expensive than the original charges. Maybe they were never ""cord cutters"" anyway?Hollywood IS making fewer movies. And cable continues to lose subscribers. Perhaps that just Twiight Zone justice?(shrug) Bills here went from $369/mo to ~$85/mo. We were 'full"" cable subscribers since 1982. Very reliable annuity. But their charges finally changed our behavior. Zero chance we'll ever sit for such charges again. Cold turkey is next if they attempt more shakedowns (not kidding). That's the power of pushback and why business should work harder to insure it never rises from it's customers.You won't get business from anyone who loathes you."
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?",I have an antenna but I also subscribe to Hulu Live and Philo. My current bill including internet is $165 including HBO but I don't have to pay $36 a month in box rental fees plus another $30 in DVR fees to record all the TV shows I want and the other miscellaneous fees Verizon would charge for their TV service. If I were to pay Verizon for everything I have currently I would be paying $205 a month just bc I don't want to sign a 2 year agreement. I would have internet anyways just bc I work from home so the $75 I pay for it is something I have to have. 
"Including internet, has the price of cord cutting equated to your last cable bill?","I was paying 189/ mo dish network, over 4 years ago. My cost now is $40/mo and watching 90% of the same content. Internet cost not a factor as I had internet cost 4 years ago outside of what I was paying to dish"

YouTube TV Support has me running in circles (RANT),"It wasn't by choice. Networks put pressure on YTTV to force the VOD with ads. As for your issues, have you tried creating a family account and linking a different Gmail? "
YouTube TV Support has me running in circles (RANT),"Well, YTTV is the only streamer to allow such liberal insertion of ads. If Hulu, Sling, Directv Now and Vue all follow suit, then the “network pressure” argument would hold a little more weight. Until then, it looks an awful lot like a concession YTTV willingly made, perhaps to secure lower fees. Everything has a price. "
YouTube TV Support has me running in circles (RANT),"So I'm trying out your advice with setting another family account login. I picked a few shows I already subscribe to, but it looks like it's going to share the recordings between accounts (maybe). That would defeat the purpose of having a separate recording to access. Will see next time it happens if they are both corrupt.I do have to say on your VOD point. The other services don't force the VODs. YTTV likely cut the deal with the networks for a discount rate. I can only guess they are using the savings there for other things like sports, infrastructure on unlimited recordings, profit or all three."

Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"First thing I would do is check and see if the cable company will get you back down to the $120 rate for cable +internet. If you’re spending “about” $50 for internet alone and “about” $50 for Vue, you’re in the same price range. Frankly I think you’ll be surprised at some unexpected limitations of streaming TV (blackouts, outages, lack of local channels, DVR storage and retention limits, forced commercials...)If they stand by the new $150 rate, even under threat of cancellation, it’s an easier choice given the potential to save about $40 per month. But for $10-15 savings, I don’t think it’s worth it at all. If you have to buy new streaming boxes for multiple TVs, it could take you 6-12 months before you save anything."
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"Hi, thanks for response. Yeah i tried to call them and explain, but they wouldn't budge. The new price is also because im now on a rolling contract. If i re-signed then it would go up again!I realize im not in for huge savings, but when you factor in things like the built in DVR which i dont have now, and the ability to have it on multiple TVs (not doing it right now, just have a small apt, so the cost of the streaming box isn't currently a big deal). I may end up having to stick with it if i cant solve the issue, but seems like I should be able to given that PS Vue and the others are clearly keeping customers and being rated highly by users, so there must be a way of getting it working better. "
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"Depending on your needs, keeping cable/satellite+internet for a few bucks above the cost of internet+streaming can make sense. I don't think streaming is the best choice for everyone, or something everyone would appreciate/prefer. At the same time, it's not as if cable/satellite is foolproof. Since going all-in with streaming, I haven't had anything blacked out, haven't been impacted by an outage, have had all my local channels and have unlimited DVR. Obviously, some of that depends on where you live, but my experience with YouTube TV as a heavy live sports watcher has been excellent.It seems like pretty much everyone who shares a post like this original poster's really wants to get away from the cable/satellite model: lease hardware from the cable/satellite company, hope it doesn't crap out after a year, pay a monthly fee for the right to use DVR, see mysterious fees all over your bill, deal with equipment and/or cancellation fees, receive terrible customer service like clockwork. Streaming a great alternative and you really don't give up much, if anything.Streaming, at the very least, simply allows you to take more control over your TV viewing. You buy a streaming device or two, you pay for the subscriptions you want, you cancel/subscribe at the drop of a hat and without penalty. My Rokus all cost \~$50 and work great for years, receive automatic updates and support, and allow you to access all kinds of media. Meanwhile, I've never had a cable/satellite box that didn't turn into a slow POS after a year."
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"Fire Stick is likely your issue with Vue.  The hardware on the stick is pretty lacking especially if it's an older version.  Live sports requires a lot more than something more static like Netflix.  If I watch on my regular Fire TV, Apple TV, or PS4 the picture is very good.  Also how is your wifi?  If you can a wired connection is always better.  But i'm wireless on my 2017 version Fire TV ""dongle"" on a 100/100 connection and it's been fine.In general if you go with the cheaper ""sticks"" (be it Roku, Fire etc.) you kind of get what you pay for.  You don't have to go all the way up to an $180 Apple TV necessarily, but at the same time spending more than $25-$30 on very basic stick would likely benefit you. From the other devices you mention.  I hear the Fire TV Cube runs well.  I see LOTS of people love the Nvidia Shield though I've never had experience with it.  I got my Apple TV off that 3 month Apple TV deal in the summer when sports wasn't as much of a concern, and now that the 3 months is over I moved back to Vue and it's nice.  And no matter what service you choose, Apple TV is one of the devices that pretty much ALL the services work on (Vue, Sling, Hulu Live, YTTV, and DirecTV Now).  I think Shield works with everything too.  But for example because  Google and Amazon won't play together,  YTTV doesn't work on Fire TV devices."
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"thanks for the response. I did a bit of googling and people saying the Firestick is limited in some of the technical capabilities (i forget the exact terms and i dont really know stuff like that, but hopefully that could solve). It's a brand new one though, picked it up for $20 on prime day. &#x200B;When you say hard wired you mean i would be better if my device can be plugged right into the router? Any idea if i can do that with Fire Tv Cube? Only problem is my router is in the perfect place right now, hidden in a storage closet, so while i could do maybe do it, maybe it wouldn't pick up the remote control? &#x200B;I like vue for the most part so the far, the layout, how it works, etc just underwhelmed disappointed with the live sports, and that is the main thing i need it for. A friend of mine had recommended it a while back and said it was great for all the soccer, NFL, etc and i thought he said he was using something quite basic as a device (though i could be wrong), and said his connection was ""literally the cheapest one available from Xfinity"" which i assume is well below the 100/100. &#x200B;I guess i can get something like Fire TV Cube and if it still sucks return it and stick with cable. &#x200B;I'm actually a little frustrated because somebody on my facebook recently was posting about how they had done the same thing after getting big bills and their comments were on how happy they were with it including the live sports. So i guess i may reach out as to what their set up is. "
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"The Roku Stick+ is an excellent device and totally worth the cost at full price ($70), and it's currently on sale for $55. I highly recommend it and Roku in general. I subscribe to YouTube TV and have been extremely satisfied. I watch/record a ton of live sports too. While I haven't tried PS Vue or Hulu Live, YouTube TV is very clearly better than Sling, DirecTV Now and FuboTV. "
Newbie to cable free viewing - what's the recommended set up for live sports?,"As others are saying, it sounds like it's your firestick causing issues. 100mbps should stream sports just fine, so either your firestick and PSVue aren't playing nice, or your WiFi signal is weak and the firestick isn't getting the connection it needs. A faster internet connection won't help, unless you're trying to stream 4k, but for 1080p, 100 is fine. Get a WiFi analyzer app on your phone and see what the signal is like near your TV, and if there are any competing signals.I know it doesn't work with Amazon's devices, but YouTubeTV always worked great for me when I had it for sports. YTTV + Chromecast was my poison of choice before I cancelled my subscription just because I couldn't personally justify the cost. It was a great service otherwise, especially if sports is your main objective. I watched F1, soccer, football, baseball, and hockey on YTTV with no complaints. Great interface and great picture, no problems streaming from my phone or computer to the Chromecast.Chromecast doesn't seem to get a lot of love on this sub compared to Roku or FireTV, but for $35, I've always thought it was a solid little device."
ATT New WiFi Wireless For Rural Areas,How much is this?
ATT New WiFi Wireless For Rural Areas,"If he's talking about [this](https://www.att.com/internet/fixed-wireless.html), then $60/mo with a 170GB/mo cap and $10 per 50GB overage fees. If wired is absolutely not an option in your area it's pretty good compared to satellite. But personally I'd go with the 3Mbps wired option if it doesn't have caps and is stable. At a secondary residence I have 2.5Mbps for $40/mo and it's perfectly usable for streaming video as long as you can live with 480p-720p video quality. And there's no cap so I can max it out at night to download things offline. With some rough math, my 2.5Mbps over 30 days gets me around 800GB of total bandwidth, way more than AT&T's 170GB cap."
ATT New WiFi Wireless For Rural Areas,Supposed to be about $50/mth and 170Gb data In The “special” they mention that you get a bonus 170Gb .Not sure about fine details though.
ATT New WiFi Wireless For Rural Areas,does this mean where wired from them is not available or where wired from anyone is not available?meaning if you have comcast or verizon or other wired in your area can you still get this?
ATT New WiFi Wireless For Rural Areas,It's a cellular hotspot plan.   Att only offers it in a few rural areas right now.  If you're interested in an alternative available nationwide you could use their unlimited iPad plan with a hotspot such as the Netgear nighthawk.   That plan is only $30/month and uncapped.      
Can I get Baltimore and DC?,"I live in Severna Park, Md under a fairly active bwi route. I’ve had poor luck with indoor antennas from Walmart. I’m thinking of going with an omnidirectional outdoor antenna if it will allow me to get Baltimore and DC. Thanks in advance for any advice. "
Can I get Baltimore and DC?,"You could certainly try an omnidirectional antenna but such antennas have a poor reputation. One trick would be finding an actual omnidirectional antenna, most are not really.Your signals are pretty much at right angles. That is somewhat optimal for combining 2 antennas with actual gain. You could try combining a couple of appropriate antennas with a high quality splitter/combiner. The bands in use for each area are the same so you could use the same antenna, twice. Examples:* Winegard HD7694P* Channel Master CM-2018If you don't have the room for those antennas you would have to use something with less performance:* Winegard HD7000R (without extensions)* RCA ANT751Here is a random example of what might be a higher quality splitter/combiner:* https://www.amazon.com/CHANNEL-2532-2-Way-Splitter-Combiner/dp/B00006JPE1/ref=sr_1_3"
Can I get Baltimore and DC?,"I live in Columbia, MD. I didn't have much luck with the indoor antennas either. Finally, I installed an omnidirectional in my attic and I get Baltimore, DC and even some from further out like Frederick. I picked up the antenna from Amazon with 80 mile range attic/outdoor by 1byone. I was going to post link but don't see it there anymore.All that said, everywhere is different, when it comes to antennas. For example, if there's a huge building between your antenna and the signal tower, you aren't going to get anything."

The main PBS app and Georgia PBS has one. I think WGBH might have one too.
Digital Antenna Help (TVFool linked inside),"You are at 40-50+ miles, just to get main networks. That’s going to almost certainly require major external antenna setup, although you could try attic first.You should consider OTT options that give locals, such as Hulu Live and DTN. Otherwise, you are looking at significant antenna project, which may not be ideal for a secondary residence that is not your own (to tweak frequently). "
Digital Antenna Help (TVFool linked inside),"For an antenna you would be looking at something like this:* Winegard HD7698P... probably pointed north toward the NY transmitters. There is a fair amount of distance here, so chances are there would be periods of bad reception and they might not get all the channels. "
Digital Antenna Help (TVFool linked inside),"You should check:https://www.fcc.gov/media/engineering/dtvmapshttps://www.antennasdirect.com/transmitter-locator.htmlThis will give you a better understanding of what channels are available and what type of antenna you'll need.

TIL the median age of people who watch cable news is more than 60 years old.,"Cable news is really the worst medium for news we've come up with:- It has to be immediate, so they often report on things before they know all the facts.- Viewers could tune in or out at any time so they can never really go deeper than surface level, or build upon any previous information.- Similarly, it's difficult to issue retractions because the audience is unlikely to see it.- They have an active incentive to withhold information to keep viewers watching: ""Is this common household item poisoning your children? Stay tuned to find out...""- Because they have to fill 24hrs of content a day, they rely on cheap talking head shouting fests rather than quality journalism.- Unlike newspaper or the internet, no real opportunity to skim past things you already know, or dig deeper into things you don't know about."
TIL the median age of people who watch cable news is more than 60 years old.,"> Because they have to fill 24hrs of content a day, they rely on cheap talking head shouting fests rather than quality journalismI don't disagree, but this point is counter-intuitive to me. 30 years ago, if you were to ask someone what level of journalism they would expect from a 24 hour news channel, they might say ""Oh, it would probably be really high quality. They're not constrained by time like the evening news so they can feature longer pieces about the events around the world."" I'm personally amazed how much news goes unreported (on television).

Television does not have coaxial cable jack.,"I'm guessing your box doesn't say ""TV"" but says ""monitor"" or ""display"" and that you don't have a tuner (which means no coax).  You'll have to purchase one separately."
Television does not have coaxial cable jack.,"your ""TV"" is a Vizio HD DISPLAY (like an E-series or something) part of what made it so cheap is that it lacks a TV Tuner and as a result you simply can't connect a coax cable to it. There is no such thing as just converting the cable type, you need a box that has a Tuner built into it. These can be gotten for like 20-40 dollars at any Walmart or similar store that has an electronics section, you would ask the person for a Digital Tuner Box with an HDMI output, alternatively you can get something like a HD Homerun or Tablo (or similar device) which you can them connect to your network and be able to watch on your phone or laptop or TV via a Fire TV, Apple TV or Android TV (exact device support depends on which box you go with)."

reception help with particular channel in my area,"Your signal is so strong that you should be able to get reception of the channel even with the cheapest of indoor antennas (possibly even with a paper clip).  Perhaps what is happening is that it's overloading your tuner?  You could try splitting the line again and see if that helps.  If not, try removing the splitter and see if that helps (as that would increase the signal level without having to buy any amps).If none of those help, the good news is that it's moving from channel 45 to 30 with the upcoming repack, so if you get WCCO and WFTC reliably, you'll hopefully get it reliably after it moves."

I got till October,Do not wait until October.Start trying the free trails now and leave your satellite off or track how many times you have to go back to it to watch a show. This will give you a good indication if cutting the cord is right for you. If you are going to use Directv Now or other services it will also allow you to compare them to your current viewing habits. 
I got till October,Good post
I got till October,I agree with this post.  I think two of the biggest mistakes people new to cord-cutting make is not making use of the free trials and planning ahead.  Give them all a try and make a point to take notes as there are several available now.
I got till October,"Buy a cheap antenna and figure out what you can get over the airways for free.  Then analyze your internet service for speed, the # of people in your household and their activities, and if your provider is going to hit you with a data cap. "
I got till October,"How many TVs are you covering?  How many people will be streaming simultaneously?  What channels do you truly need?  What streaming devices do you already have?  Do you need live news/sports?  Those are some initial questions.  Almost all services have free trials.  Take advantage of those.  I’ve used PS Vue, You Tube TV, DirecTV Now and I’m about to start a quick Hulu with Live TV trial to feel it out before I turn Vue back on for football season (I want Vue for NFL Redzone).   All have Pros/Cons.  The flexibility of being able to get out of them after 1 month max is huge.  As well as the lower cost."
I got till October,"Research,research and more research.  Realize initial investment could be pricey. But you will make that back over time. You don’t need to spend it all at once, I personally would start now, figure out what streaming box you are interested in, buy one, set it up on your main tv and start taking advantage of the free trials most the services have and go from there. "
I got till October,"Couple of questions. What’s sort of streaming do you have right now? Amazon/Netflix/Hulu? And then, what are you looking for going forward? A live TV replacement? Do you like live Sports? That’ll be a big part of your decision making "
I got till October,"Note that PlayStation Vue allows 5 simultaneous streams, so it might be a good option for you. Also, I believe YouTube TV allows 6.  "
I got till October,You tube TV only has 3 simultaneous streams.  They do allow for 6 user profiles though.
I got till October,"The number of TVs isn’t as important as the number of streams you need. For example with youtubetv you have 3 streams but if I want to stream 3 football games while other tvs are watching love tv I can also login to watchespn, foxsports go etc. and those do not count against my 3 stareams. "
I got till October,If you are going to use an ISP with a data cap be sure to monitor your usage weekly or even daily. It seems like 1tb is fairly standard with the bigger companies which totals out to roughly 33-36GB a day depending on the month. As others have said start using free trials all next month and watch closely to see what you’re using data-wise. If you’re eclipsing that daily allowance regularly then it might not be worth ditching your current service unless you can put together a plan to cut your data use.

Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,Any recommendations on Prime? I struggle with what to watch.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"Prime is pretty heavy on the drama side but has some good ones. Bosch is one of my favorite shows running now.  Also Sneaky Pete, Goliath, Man in the High Castle, Catastrophe and The Tick are good exclusives. Jack Ryan debuts next week. As for non exclusives, most of the HBO stuff is good (Veep and Entourage are personal favorites). Also Justified, The Americans, The Expanse, Parks & Rec, 24, Chuck, Battlestar Galactica, Spongebob, all of the Star Trek series. Aside from the Marvel/Disney films (which I tend to buy anyway), Prime tends to have a better movie selection than Netflix, too.  For all the content they keep adding to Netflix, I struggle to come up with more than a half dozen shows that I truly enjoy: Daredevil, Lost in Space, Ozark, Jessica Jones (though I’m stalled in second season), One Day at a Time, Arrested Development (fading fast)..."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"On the sports end, I'm a big fan of the All or Nothing series. If you're looking for drama, they have BBC's War and Peace adaptation and Donnie Brasco. If action, they have Collateral, the Kingdom, and Snatch.And that feels like the tip of the iceberg. Netflix has good content, don't get me wrong, but I feel like I have to wade through piles of dreck to find a collection like what I just named, and I didn't even have to dig to get those."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,I love their 60s game show selection. What's My Line is my favorite.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,Patriot is a great show. 
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"All or nothing would be better if it was released during the season.  I have a hard time giving a fuck about a team that I know looses lose again.I think primes interface and intermingled prime and purchased shows sucks I also find most of the content on there sucks, minus a few notable exceptions.  I'll check out Ryan and lotr though."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,Might cause issues if they broadcast anything remotely close labeled as a distraction. But I agree it would be better with weekly releases.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"Your opinion. I’ve had amazon for years and just recently got Netflix and intend to keep both as both are solid, but I don’t consider prime much of an expense because I bought it mainly for the shipping "
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,I couldn’t disagree with you more. Netflix’s original content is far superior to Amazon Primes plus there’s a lot more of it.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,I love having both and for the price I'm good with paying for both indefinitely. 
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"Both is definitely ideal. For the price I used to pay for basic cable, I could subscribe to Netflix, Amazon Prime, and HBO. The world has changed for the better."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,The quality of the top shows on each isnt even close.   Sneaky Pete and Season 1 of Goliath are good.   Thats it for Prime.Prime has better 3rd party support easily.   But original content wise they arent even in the discussion.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,Patriot is pretty good as well. The show is not what the title implies. 
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,Bosch. Man in High Castle.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,I have both. And I effectively pay nothing for either. I'd have Prime anyway for the shipping. A d Tmobile pays my Netflix bill.
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"My main complaints with Amazon Prime (usually my last choice for streaming):* Their viewing app (on my Vizio Smart TV) is a POS. Ideally, it should have 10- or 30-second skip back/ahead, and faster speed playing (1.2x, 1.5x, and 2x).* Too often, the closed captions are not synced correctly with dialog. I've had them be up to 15 seconds off. IOW, less than useless. I usually get a $5 credit when I complain, to compensate for my ""inconvenience""."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"since I consider my amazon prime free, I keep both going and added Hulu years ago"
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"I don't have prime and don't really intend to get it, but I am tempted by Hulu.I""m more or less against Hulu on principle for not offering a free with ads version and instead offering a ""pay with ads"" version which is not the new paradigm and I am mad at them for double dipping like cable companies do but that being said, having *just* Netflix can leave me feeling a bit lacking at times and I'm strongly considering signing up for the ad free version of Hulu."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"I've started using Prime Video more than in the past, but it's still definitely the third choice. Netflix has, far and away, the best original content and interface. Hulu has a couple great shows and all of the major network shows and South Park. Prime has more quality original content than Hulu and some exclusives, but after that it's kind of a retread of content available on other services. It seems like they've recognized this and they're now concentrating on quality original content. They even copy the Netflix format on YouTube of showing the next month's content. What Amazon needs to do a better job of is marketing their originals (Man in the High Castle, Grand Tour, All or Nothing, Sneaky Pete, The Expanse, Jack Ryan, Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Homecoming, etc) and highlighting their exclusive content (The Americans, Downton Abbey, Dr. Who, Mr. Robot, etc.). Also their interface needs an overhaul. "
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"I've had them both for a few years. Overall I prefer Netflix still, though I understand the dings against their catalog. It has definitely gone south since their heyday a few years back. A lot of stuff that was on Netflix has moved to Amazon Prime or Hulu or elsewhere.I prefer Netflix's original content so far, haven't really gotten into much of Amazon Prime's. I will be trying out Jack Ryan and some other things this fall though.I prefer Netflix's app. With Prime it's hard to tell if a show is actually available to watch or if I have to pay. Maybe there is a way to filter it, but I haven't found it yet. It takes more clicks to get something into my watchlist, and it's harder to discover new content on Prime in my experience. My Netflix queue was up over 80 at one point (I recently pruned it seriously) and I don't think my Prime queue has ever gotten over 15."
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,"Originals and exclusives aside, what is the value-add of Prime compared to Netflix?"
Netflix vs. Amazon Prime,I'm not sure I understand the question.

Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"Have you read the antenna guide linked in the sidebar?  Have you run a tvfool report? Run 2 - one with height you might mount it on house, another with height on barn.  40-45 yards from the house to the barn, so about 130'. Is that counting the distance up to the antenna on the barn? Another 25' or so. And the distance inside the house to the tv? Another 20'-30'.  That's up to about 170'. That's probably 8-9dB signal loss just from the distance.  Splitter to go to multiple tv's in the house? More signal loss. Even more if it's split more than once.  You may need a higher gain antenna, or a preamp mounted at the antenna. Or both."
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"It's OK if you get a good low noise amp to boost the signal.  You want the amp at the antenna end.  Another option, is to go to RG11 cable instead of RG6.  Don't worry about quad shielding.  It's a waste of money.  "
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"RG11 with a higher gain antenna is what I would do.  I prefer to avoid using a pre-amp when possible, mostly because I have to plug in one more device near the TV, but also to keep the system as simple and reliable as possible."
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"I don't think 40-45 yards is that long tbh.  In my experience involving coax, a properly terminated end, and using the proper gauge/impedance cable is infinitely more important.   Signal ingress interference is very real.  Coax related signals, unlike an AC power cord or RJ-45 type networking connection, is very sensitive to connectors, and breaks etc.  Each time you try to use a barrel coupler connector, to join two coaxes, you increase the potential for db loss.  But I do know some cabletv installers actually intentionally add a coupler at the demarc location, and ground it to a waterline, etc to protect things from lighning strikes, etc.  Also, make sure it is outdoor rated coax, i've had indoor rated cat6 I left baking in the sun for a few months totally go bad and crack on me.Worse case scenario, you might need to pair things with a signal amplifier, etc."
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"it's not a horrible mistake, but yes, with each additional foot of cable ran there is additional signal loss from the source. this is why the shortest possible run is always suggested. there are amplifier solutions available for longer runs but ideally you should strive for the shortest cable runs and avoid the amplifier solutions if at all possible. in a lot of cases they can cause more issues than they purport to solve."

Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"I think you should be fine with some RG6 coax and an good amplifier. I believe RG6 is what most cable companies use to get signal from their equipment at the street to a splitter or amplifier at your house. The coax you buy off the shelf and probably already have wired into your home should be RG5. Someone please correct me if I’m wrong here. Have you tried one of those flat panel indoor antennas with a small amp yet? If not, give it a shot.  You might not need a big antenna on the barn to get the channels you want. Just a thought..."

Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"A big part of it too is how far are you from the transmitting tower?  If your semi close or use an electrically large antenna, you’ll have sufficient signal to not have an issue.   Without getting too techie , for RG-6 you would be talking somewhere around 5 dB per 100 ft of loss.   By comparison, a 2 way splitter will give you 3 dB insertion loss, so the cable loss over the long run isn’t going to be a huge part of the equation. "

They can amplify the signals you don’t want (FM radio broadcast, LTE, public service bands) and mix products on top of ATSC broadcasts.  100 feet of RG6 has a loss of about 3 to 4 dB at 400 MHz, and that shouldn’t impact your receive performance unless you’re on the fringe areas.  The best addition to my performance was adding LTE and FM broadcast notch filters... "
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,"1. Yes, the length of the cable can affect reception in a situation where reception is an issue. I had two Mofu leaf antennas. The newer one had a much longer cord and pulled in only a couple channels reliably. The older model, with a much shorter cord, pulled in about 10 channels. The two cord lengths couldn't have been much different than 6 and 12 feet because they were both indoor antennas (I don't remember how long they were). 2.  The phrase 'digital antenna' is just a marketing term. All antennas pull analog and digital signals from the air. What matters is whether you have an old TV that only accepts analog signals, and thus needs a digital converter box to make a digital signal usable on your old TV.Edit: going by Mohu antennas sold right now, the longer cable may have been as long as 16 feet."
Does a longer coax = poor quality for a digital antenna?,Coaxial cable in theory can go 1640ft or 500m.  I would not go beyond 1000ft.  Also depends on the signal strength and whether you are preamp etc.

Help with antenna selection,"A first question is what set ups you are willing to use. Do you want to stay with an indoor antenna, is an attic antenna an option, and would you be willing to work with an outside or rooftop setup? Your TV fool report looks good in terms of range for the local channels, though the aspect of the report covering VHF stations would be helpful in analyzing it. It may be that if you have dense tree coverage a roof mounted antenna to gain some height would be advantageous. The second would be what exactly do you mean by ""doesn't work"" in regards to the current window antenna? Does it get any reception for any channels, or does it fail to receive any signals? Do times of day make a difference (any slight improvements in the evenings per chance)? If you have the model of the indoor antenna that would also be helpful"

However the issue is that in less than a year they have gone through 3-4 major changes that differ from what they initially used to get people to sign in and are slowly trying to get back to what they were pre-unlimited movie - which was a very obscure company.

I didn't do it often because movies are expensive and I have a nice TV at home and shelves full of videos.I got moviepass because I am now a cripple and figured it'd get me out of the house and give me something to do in a nice warm theater in winter and a nice cool theater in summer.

But there are still only a handful of movies I want to see at all. There have been none in the last month, there's one I'm just sorta thinking about now. So when MoviePass blocked one of the rare movies I wanted to see, and a friend ended up takign me and buying me a ticket on his AMC Stubs account, and in fact they wouldn't let me see anythign else because they cancelled all showings, I decided that enough was enough and got my refund from Costco."

One of America's oldest companies is getting into fixed wireless,"Now that would be pretty goddamn magic.

The town is still very much there, though (I mean more or less).My mom still lives there, as does a large part of my extended family. Internet is pure shit. 1.5mb/s over DSL.

Help with OTA antenna for football season,"I'd like to try and help you out!. Without writing a book and giving you a bigger headache:), I'll try to condense it and if you have more questions, just reply and I'll do what I can.For your antenna: I think you'd be better with an omni-directional antenna, they do make flat ones with 2 horizontal wings that is for vhf. Also, make sure that the antenna has an amplifier. Disregard the distance claims on antennas, they are notoriously over rated for distance. Price also doesn't translate into better reception. Distance from transmitter, strength of signal that the network is sending. antenna height, terrain and most important DIRECTION TO THE TRANSMITTERS. Looks like your closest Fox station is Southwest, your NBC is Northwest and the others are North. Trying to pick those up without having to constantly re orient the antenna is going to be close to impossible. The omni directional aimed WEST would be halfway between everything but that's a very wide area. Some of the outdoor antennas do have a remote that controls a motor that will allow you to move the antenna remotely.FYI: All of my transmitters are within 10 degrees of each other facing northwest, all are 19-25 miles away, I'm using a $35 RCA omni directional, rated for 55 miles but I think with my terrain, etc it's more like 30, with an amp and it is placed in my window sill at about 3 feet from the floor and I get great reception.Make sure that your coax cable is RG6, try not to use a splitter but if have to, make sure to put a terminator on the unused connection(s).FYI: I use an hd homerun with the antenna connected to the homerun and the homerun connected to my router via ethernet and stream it all to my tv's, I'm extremely satisfied with it, but won't get into all these details, just thought you may be interested. Good luck and if I can be of further assistance, just reply."

YTTV or Hulu Live?,"I did the monthly trial of both (and you should, too) and I don't really watch sports. &#x200B;I generally preferred the interface of YTTV and found the experience 'better' and they had a better DVR experience. HOWEVER, as someone who also uses the basic Hulu plan, I really missed the VOD.&#x200B;If you like a vast VOD catalog you really should stick with Hulu. If you like DVR, go with YTTV.&#x200B;&#x200B;"
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Does either Hulu or YTTV work for a cable ""sign in"" for some of the other streaming channels on Roku (as example). Like the MTV App or Disney App requires a cable provider sign in. As of now, I can use my DTV Now one for that and it suffices. I'm guessing Hulu Live, YTTV, Philo, Vue, etc all DON'T work for that part?"
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"For the longest time, the YTTV had the advantage of being a better video service than Hulu. Hulu would buffer all the time while YTTV wouldn’t buffer at all. But that has basically been resolved on hulu’s End so it comes down to the content of Hulu vs the features of YTTV, which I think Hulu wins out on pretty easily. Hulu with Live Tv can come with its no commercial streaming library (basically no commercials except like 5 or 6 ABC shows that have contractual obligations) for 43.99 I believe. The channel selection is also wider on Hulu. The one biiiig advantage of YTTV is that it comes with unlimited DVR while Hulu comes with 50 hours in its plan, with the option to go to 200 for 15 dollars (not worth it). However, I think Hulu’s DVR storage will expand as the service matures, though i doubt itll have have unlimited like YTTV as that is backed by Google. This problem is mitigated a bit by the fact that a lot of the stuff you might be recording will be on Hulu’s streaming catalog. You can skip commercials on all DVR stuff for both. Looking into the future, I’m pretty sure Hulu will be the better overall option. You’ll probably be able to bundle with that Disney VOD and ESPN+ service for a cheaper price with Hulu, if that interests you at all. Just my opinion tho. Hulu and YTTV are clearly the top two Live Tv choices. If I were in your choice though, it’s be a tough choice because I love the NBA "
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"> You can skip commercials on all DVR stuff for both.This is not true. You cannot skip commercials on Hulu for things on the DVR, only VOD is commercial free if you upgrade. For example, we recorded a baseball game yesterday, tried to watch it today and were forced to watch all commercials. I spoke with a rep and there is no way around this.I just signed up for a YTTV trial, but now I'm reading they remove your DVR recordings in a day or so and force you to watch VOD with commercials. Although I'm not sure this also applies to sporting events (which are intolerable with commercials). I will test and find out.These streaming services are shooting themselves in the foot. I'm seriously considering going back to cable to skip all their forced commercial watching baloney."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Don’t forget that Fubo TV just added Turner channels to their lineup, and have tons of sports including NBATV and NFL RedZone available. "
YTTV or Hulu Live?,Does Fubo force commercials or delete your DVR recordings like Hulu and YTTV?
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"I've had Hulu Live for the past month after switching from YTTV. If you want to be able to fast forward through all commericals with Hulu Live you have to pay the extra $15 for their enhanced cloud DVR. Also if you have multiple people watching be warned that the DVR hours are shared across profiles. I prefer Hulu bc of the channel lineup, the VOD library and the fact that it works on literally all my devices. I supplement Hulu Live with Philo for the Viacom channels as Hulu has A&E, Lifetime, HGTV and Food Network in its core lineup but YTTV doesn't. All those channels are available on Philo though.In terms of stability lately I've found both services to be equally reliable. "
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Just to clarify, not all recordings prohibit you from FFWing through commercials. For example whatever I record on Cozi I can FFW through the commercials. On networks like CBS I can FFW through commercials if I watch within the first 24 hours. When a commercial starts on the DVR, if there is no countdown timer you can FFW. If there is a countdown timer that means ads were inserted and you can’t FFW.  For me personally about 30% of what I watch on Hulu has added commercials so the added fee for the “enhanced” DVR isn’t really worth it unless I need the space. But at least there is the option for those that find value in it. "
YTTV or Hulu Live?,I just spoke with a rep about fast forwarding commercials in recorded DVR content and they didn't mention the $15 enhanced option. Odd.
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Posted a variant of this elsewhere, but it may help,Hulu with no commercials + the Enhanced 200hr DVR add-on is $60, AND it includes the base Hulu VOD catalog of TV shows, originals, movies, and day after it airs network TV with no commercials. No other service has this.  Also, Hulu doesn't force VOD for DVR'd shows like YTTV does.**The no commercials plan does not apply to the additional VOD you get as a result of the new channels added from Live TV. It only applies to the base Hulu VOD catalog.UI is subjective, if you prefer cable box type UI's, then YTTV is ‘better’. I prefer Hulu’s approach, initially I did not.To me, a much stronger argument could be made for Hulu and its value than for YTTV."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,I have YTTVAll your DVRd episodes exist but when a channel puts out a VOD of that episode and flags it as VOD required YTTV will only allow you to play the VOD which will likely have commercials. How many depends on the channel and show. If the channel discontinues the VOD you can watch your recording again which will be able to skip commercials.In my experience if you watch within 24 hours you get your DVRd episode. The bigger the channel the more likely the VOD will be up after 24 hours. smaller channels won't offer up VOD quickly or won't flag those shows as VOD required(Disney channel for example seems to never bother).I haven't tried Hulu live but based on my experience with teh cheap and commercial free tiers I'm happier with YTTV. The UI is better and easier to track/find shows with.
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Been a YTTV customer for a year. I tried Hulu for a short time first.As far as the YTTV DVR/VOD issue, only about 25% of the networks force a VOD on you. Most all sporting events are straight DVR. Also, the longer you wait to watch your recording, the more likely you might get VOD. Even so, there aren't many commercials in most cases. The majors like CBS, ABC, NBC, etc. will be most likely to force VOD.Hulu? Not worth it at all unless you choose ""Enhanced Cloud DVR"". Otherwise you'll be looking  at (or trying to ignore) more commercials.They are both good services, I guess. This is especially true since the Turner networks were added to Hulu. YTTV got em a few months ago.I'll stick with YTTV cause I'm grandfathered at $35. And I'm used to the interface now, which I think is the better of the two.My .$02...try em and see what you think."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,I liked Hulu live better until they changed the interface
YTTV or Hulu Live?,Tried a couple of the streaming services and now have YTTV and it really is not close.Much prefer YTTV because of the lack of lag with the DVR that the other cloud based services suffer.    Coming from a Tivo with local storage I am use to a responsive DVR.
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"YouTubeTV: $40/month, unlimited DVR but major non-sports/news/ABC channels switch DVR'd content to VOD in under a day, and there is no way to skip commercials on VOD. They're full-length commercials, too. There is no way to pay them more to fix that.Hulu LiveTV: $40/month, but that's only a 50 hour DVR and it doesn't let you skip commercials. For another $15/month (up to $55/month now), you get a 200 hour DVR and can skip commercials on it. As other people noted, this also includes the normal Hulu content, but removing most commercials there is *another* $4/month, for a grand total of $59/month for what I consider an usable service. So it is substantially more expensive.Really it depends on whether the channels you watch force VOD and if so, if you can deal with commercials. If you primarily watch sports or news you'll like YouTubeTV a lot. If not, lots of ads."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"I've been a Hulu+ subscriber since long before I cut the cord.  I have never used their Live TV service since the overlap between the content they offer vs the content that I wanted allowed me to immediately eliminate them from consideration when I was making my plans.  (I do have HBO through Hulu which allows me to watch live channels so I don't know if that's different than the standard Live TV interface.  I'm betting it's the same)  I have to say though, unless the interface for Live TV is drastically different from regular Hulu Plus, it's the worst I've ever seen by far.  YTTV is also the my favorite by far so that's an easy win for YTTV.  My recommendation is to start a trial for each to see which you like better.  When I first cut the cord I did trials of DTVNOW, SlingTV, and YTTV as they best met my needs.  Didn't take long to choose YTTV as my favorite and then when Philo came around it made the perfect compliment.  For reference on the YTTV VOD debacle:  YTTV has always had a policy where the networks could force VOD over DVR when it was available.  You can skip commercials during your DVR recordings but not VOD (pretty standard).  A few months ago it seemed to get much worse, sometimes happening within a day (or hours) where before it usually seemed to take several.  This became especially obvious when they allowed the option to choose a recording and more often than not you could see your DVR recording but not actually play it (complete with disclaimer that the network had disallowed it). This seems to have softened up some recently, most noticeably with Fox, but is still present.  This forced VOD also seems to expire as I've played catch up at times and only had to watch the VOD versions of some episodes.  Personally I find it an annoyance but only a minor one.  I've complained to them about it, as has everyone else I'm sure, but for me the service has so many other advantages over the others that it's barely a blip on my radar.  They are constantly evolving the service and at this point have implemented pretty much all of the most requested features as far as I know.  "
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"I can only speak to the YouTube TV experience, but the issue some people have with its DVR is that in some cases you will go to watch a show you recorded and the only viewing option is an on demand version rather than a recording. So rather than being able to fast-forward through commercials, you're stuck watching ads during commercial breaks.That said, this is only *some* shows on *some* channels, and usually network channels. As someone who mostly watches/records live sports on YouTube TV, this hasn't been an issue (it never happens with sporting events, for instance). However, if you watch a lot of stuff on local channels, it could be an annoyance. I've only experienced this with a couple ABC shows, and even then I'm usually able to choose between the DVR and VOD versions of the show if I try to watch within a couple days of when it originally aired."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"Experienced too many problems using Hulu w/ live TV and their tech support pretty much blamed all my issues on my internet speed. (Gigabit) Switched to YTTV and haven't looked back since. Much better UI, and the DVR is easy to use. I like being able to select my favorite sports teams as well. The VOD isn't as big as Hulu which is why I sub to both YTTV and Hulu w/ no commercials. Works better for me overall."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,"> Do I get all the VoD stuff, commercial free if I subscribe to Live stream (I currently pay the $12/mo for commercial free VoD)?AFAIK, it only includes the base Hulu plan.  You'd have to pay the extra $4 a month to get commercial free.> Does the Hulu DVR allow me to skip all commercials?Not unless you pay the extra $15 for the ""enhanced DVR"".> YTTV: What's this DVR vs VoD topic? I see a lot of stuff about them forcing you to watch your recordings as VoD and watching commercials? Has that changed where you can skip commercials or no?As I understand it, YTTV lets networks force you to watch the VOD version instead of the DVR version if they wish, and you can't skip commercials on the VOD version.  I haven't used it, though, so I couldn't say what the split is on networks that allow DVR vs. the networks that force VOD."
YTTV or Hulu Live?,These were definitely the top 2 packages for me.  I went with YTTV because of a slightly better mix of channels for me in the base package (AMC and MLB are two channels I watch a lot).  Tech seems a bit better on YTTV though there were close.I probably will end up getting regular Hulu without commercials as that solves half of the VOD/DVR problem and the additional Hulu content is worth it.

"Ematic Android TV Streaming Box Makes FCC Appearance, Launch Imminent?",I’m all for new hardware coming out but after the dumpster fire that was/is the Mibox I’m staying away.

Comcast/Charter lobby asks FTC to preempt state broadband regulations,They can get fucked. This is one area where I'd want the States to just tell the Feds to fuck off if they tried to preempt. Drag out the process and make it as long and as painful for the FCC and Comcast as possible.
Comcast/Charter lobby asks FTC to preempt state broadband regulations,"Ultimately it's the U.S. Constitution that arbitrates between State and Federal governments, not our random whims or desires.

Comcast/Charter lobby asks FTC to preempt state broadband regulations,"It's laughable that the providers are arguing there's plenty of ""competition"" when they're simply citing services and not actual broadband providers. Where I live I have 2 options - Fios or Xfinity. Meanwhile if I want to have a cellphone plan, I have 8 or 9 different carriers I can choose from. If I want to shop for groceries, I have 6 different options to choose from, more if I want to drive a little bit further. You get the idea, the broadband industry has not competition. "

Safely running coax on roof?,"I would go into the attic through a vent, your roof is going to get hot and that’s not the best place for co-ax. "
Safely running coax on roof?,What about a pole mounted on the side of the house so your antenna can be above the peak?
Safely running coax on roof?,"That's essentially option 5.  I could add some guy wires if I got the pole really high, though that would be a bit unsightly."
Safely running coax on roof?,"Wind won't pick up a cable flat to the roof and move it around. Here in the great white north the problem is with ice and snow sliding off the roof and taking the cable with it. I have had some success with anchoring the cable securely at the top and running it so it is going in the same direction the ice and snow is expected to go.I once just gave in and drilled a hole straight down through the cap shingles into the attic. Roofers cement sealed the gap around the cable. The idea is that there is little water and snow at the peak of a roof so you don't need much to keep it out. Don't remember how long that lasted but it was a significant number of years. When the roof is replaced you just push the cable down and drill another hole in the new roof.Speaking of roofers cement, you can use blobs of it to tack a cable in place along a ridge line. Unsightly if done to excess but it does work well."
Safely running coax on roof?,"In a similar situation, I got some aerial coax from the cable company and used the messenger (carrier) cable to secure it as it crossed the roof.Basically I measured the distance between the roof edge and the antenna mast, leaving 6"" of messenger/carrier cable extra on each end.I wrapped that 6"" steel messenger/carrier around the antenna mast and then pulled the coax back to the roof edge, where I had screwed a bolt into the fascia but protected from the elements, and wrapped the other 6"" of messenger cable around it.This both secured the cable across the roof from wind, but also to a certain extent from wear.I replaced it once after about 5 years because of damage from rubbing on the roof. But it was cheap enough that it didn't matter."
Safely running coax on roof?,"To clarify, you made the cable really tight across the roof to keep it from moving around too much?  Essentially tightening it between the mast and a screw just off the roof?"

"How Do I Watch HBO in Canada Legally on Mac / Windows, Latest Episodes?","You are not going to like this answer..... You need the TMNGO app to do that, and in order to get that you need first a basic cable sub, then you need a premium channel sub, that gets you HBO, Showtime etc. Then and only then can you use TMNGO with your sub to watch the latest HBO shows. A better alternative if you only watch a couple shows, like say you mainly watch Game of Thrones or Westworld, you can go on Google Play Movies and TV and just buy the seasons  / episodes you want. An entire season is like 15-25$ so if you only watch 3-4 shows during the year its a fraction of the cost of the cable sub + premium channel sub (which usually is about 80$ a month).   So lets say you only watch 4 HBO shows, well that would cost you about the same as a single month of subscriptions. The shows you buy on Google Play Movies and TV are very accessible, You can watch them either through the playstore, the Google Play Movies and TV app or through YouTube itself. So you can access them from literally anything that can connect to the net. I bought the latest season of The Venture Bros to test it out, since the Adult Swim app in Canada is total crap... And I was quite impressed at how usable the service is. "
"How Do I Watch HBO in Canada Legally on Mac / Windows, Latest Episodes?","Hmm, I didn't think that buying an entire season could be cheaper than cable + HBO/TMN. Thanks for the idea.It seems that buying individual episodes as they release costs similar to buying the entire season. And release dates are only a few days after original air date, at most.For some reason, Westworld episodes were unavailable on YouTube or Google Play or I forgot which, but now it's on both.Thanks."

Deeper Dive—AT&T has extra SVOD gems in Crunchyroll and VRV,"I'm actually more okay with this than I thought, although this can change if enough counter-arguments convince me otherwise. AT&T has been making cash-cow moves with its acquisitions. If it starts to try to burn some cash to generate content to appeal to consumers, that signal reflects that it intends to represent itself going in a different (and likely, a more preferred) direction. Maybe I'm reading this wrong - persons here feeling otherwise?"

That’ll pull up the all recordings screen. 3) start a recording, press pause, click info and you’ll be able to delete the recording from that screen.

Looking for antenna help (TV Fool link inside),"Like the other poster said, NBC is on VHF. The flat antennas like that don't typically perform well with VHF, since they're designed for UHF radio waves that are about 1/4 the size of VHF. The old bunny ears style of antenna you can find for less than $15 usually will perform the best of any indoor antenna for vhf, even if they're a bit unsightly. [I'm using this one for 2 VHF stations](https://www.amazon.com/RCA-Indoor-HDTV-Antenna-Rabbit/dp/B000HKGK8Y/) about 15 miles away, it works fine in my case as long as it's not on an electronic device."
Looking for antenna help (TV Fool link inside),"I'm not an expert, but it looks like NBC is a VHF more than 20 miles away, which is a little tricky.  Maybe take a look at the Wineguard 5500 series that has the ability to plug in for amplification or the Clearstream Max 2."
Looking for antenna help (TV Fool link inside),I have the Winegard and it does pull in channel 11 but heavy rain tended to kill the signal.  I upgraded to a small yagi style antenna from Walmart.

Before Univision got removed from the Sling lineup that was an even better deal for us, getting about ~40 channels on the blue package. I also hear conflicting reports from other locals about Univision on Spectrum. Some get same as always, some have been asked to pay $12 a month to keep it, and several others have told me it's just not available for them anymore at all.I feel kind of guilty for not going in on the semi a la carte service because it's something I've always said I wanted, but by the time anyone rolled it out there were better cheaper options."

What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I don't want a cable replacement service.  The days of me watching a channel on a schedule are gone.  I still watch sports, but I have been watching those without cable or a ""channel"" for over 7 years now."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,I don't want a replacement for cable/satellite.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Oh come on! Why dont you want to pay a hundred dollars per month to be constantly force fed obnoxious shouting condescending ads every 10 minutes between obnoxious shouting condescending programs?I cant believe how jarring television seems now when I visit my parents house.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Being able to choose what channels I wanted. That'll never happen though because 90% of the channels would go under in a month or two. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Isn't that what capitalism is all about though? If your channel sucks, shouldn't it go under?"
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I always resented having to subsidize all those shitty channels I never watched, yet had to upgrade to a higher package to pay for the one I really wanted."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"This. And it'd be more expensive for a lot of people, depending on what channels you want."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I get most of what I want/need from my YTTV and Philo combo. I want my locals, my regional and national sports channels, DVR function, and portability. My only complaints with my combo is it's not true DVR (VOD in most cases) and no NFL/NHL networks, but neither of those complaints bothers me enough to re-subscribe to cable. Not even close..."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Time-shifting and immediate availability of aired television.For example: I can watch CBS live, but if I'm 5 minutes late I can't rewind. If I miss the show I also have to wait until the next day or whenever they add it to the on-demand streaming service.HBO does it right in my opinion, I was able to watch Westworld immediately on-demand 5 minutes before the show aired on the network."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"In this order, but all very important:1. **On demand.** It is 2018. No more fixed-time nonsense. As soon as it airs, I want access to it.  This means no more 1-2+ day delay after airing. I like how HBO does it. As soon as it starts on TV, it's available on their streaming service. 1. **No commercials**. I've gotten a taste without, and now they're increasingly intolerable. 1. **Good value.** I don't quite want to say cheap although saving money is a concern. I think there is a balance to be achieved. I don't mind paying for what I want to use, but I am not going to pay $10+ for every channel that has a show or two worth watching. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,LOL I think we have a pissed off cable rep in the thread downvoting everyone LOL. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"- no ads- on demand streaming- a reasonable, stable price which only changes modestly and rarely to accommodate with cost of living adjustments- programming worth watching"
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Portability. No shit filler channels. Vast On demand. Low price point. Fast loading and no buffering. Fewest clicks possible to navigate UI.Sling is close but it has a lot of garbage channels and I wish I could block them or exchange them for something else.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"This dream is pretending that the perfect service could be created. First, I want high quality video, 1080p at least. I want a slick minimal user interface that delivers every show/sport the day it comes out, on demand, with no ads. With every show every episode included, no holes like current on demand. It should have an on demand section, a live events section, and a ppv section. After the live event airs, it would be accessible to watch in the on demand library. It would eliminate the need for recording which eventually will be considered old tech. As for ads... fuck em let me pay for a premium experience. Maybe have different tiers (a lower price for ads in your content, a higher price for no ads.) I know it will never happen because it's too perfect, but damn, I would pay so much for a service like this."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"First and foremost, the ability to watch what I want, when I want, which is what TiVo first brought to the table two decades ago. The ability to skip commercials was never anything more than a neat bonus feature which TiVo *also made possible* but it was never, for me, the prime motivator. Time-shifting is always what mattered most.But my new most important criteria is to never overlay a commercial on top of the actual program. Network and Cable TV does this all the fucking time with their animated bullshit in the corner, and now Netflix is starting to do it too with their ""personalized recommendations"" instead of running credits full screen, which are *PART OF THE SHOW!*So those are my top two. Do not truncate or obstruct any portion of the content for any reason, and there's no such thing as a schedule. Those are, without question, the worst parts of cable. Eliminate them, and I'm happy.Maintain those two, and I'm perfectly happy to strike a balance between price and presence of respectfully-run commercials, where more or less of one would reasonably dictate the opposite of the other."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"The PS Vue offers automatic 30 day DVR for any show you favorite and often if the network offers an on demand service you can get full previous seasons too the moment you favorite a show. Honestly, this is what I was looking for. No need to set it or worry about space, just watch whatever whenever."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"All I want is to be able to watch my favorite shows, hassle free. Everything else is unexpected and just icing on the cake."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Reliability. I want things to work without my having to jump through hoops.    Easy and intuitive user interface.    **Customer service that actually helps solve problems and gives a shit.**
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Reliability and ease of use.  I don't want to have to explain how things work for 10 minutes to guests or the babysitter.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"This is such a good point and didn't really run into it until my in-laws watched my kids and gave a ""da faq is this? An app? huh?"".  There are generations of people just USED to channel surfing through absolute shit.  Granted I'm blessed to have a slingbox placed at their place for NHL...it'll take awhile to shake that generation.  My parents however have been cord nevers, so their conversion was super easy. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"No commercials, I'll pay for a service that doesn't have commercials but if you want to show me commercials, I'm out.Beyond that, don't package it up (sling) and don't mix in paid content so it's hard to tell if it's paid or free with my subscription (Amazon Prime). It's really pretty simple - no commercials, don't be needlessly deceptive and I am more than happy to pay you for a good service. Netflix does it right... don't screw it up by adding commercials but if you want to tell me about one of your other shows for 5-10 seconds AT THE BEGINNING of something I'm about to watch, cool, but don't interrupt the show."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,100 percent agree
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"My wife is very involved in our community, so all the local channels in our rural town is pretty much a must. It's what keeps us tied to cable right now, I can't find another service that provides them all. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,No commercials
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"As a current DirecTV Now customer that is on the fence about cancelling...A la carte would really be living the dream - I don't want channels forced on me that I'll never watch (sports, news, kids, etc.).I want a live buffer where I can pause and rewind live TVI want a reliable DVR feature with proper record optionsI want 5.1 audio support for all live channels that broadcast multi-channel audio."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Just need all my sports and a couple of lifestyle channels for the wife (HGTV etc.)  PS Vue fills the need for me right now.  I've got to pay $50 since I want sports.  But that's fine with me since it's still less than half of what I was paying with cable.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Pause Live Tv with skip forward Skip commercials on recordingsComplete seasons of a show on demand with fast forward (skip commercials) and resume
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Hulu is probably our best bet for something like that. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"This is kind of academic for me, because my GF will require us to have a service that provides live sports programming, but...I'd be perfectly happy if I had some way to access live national/international news, a weather channel, and the Olympics every 2 years.  Everything else I can get OTA or through an on-demand streaming service, a la Netflix."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"(shrug) We buy la carte now. That closes off many suppliers who demand to sell more, but if enough users push back - all of these companies can be brought to their knees within a month.Users just must be willing to go to the brink - and not blink.A newer phenomenon is more concerning. Sellers are beginning to toy with customers via the sale of marketing data. IMO, those damn pop ups at the end of every Starz movie are connected to the sale of subscriber information.Why we fired them.What we want? Simple transaction, no hassles, no ""entanglements"". Suppliers should not need to cheat to make a profit. Selling us out is cheating.Here's an idea. Cable replacement suppliers should sell anonymous tokens which can be redeemed for months of service delivery. Why do I need an account with your company?"
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I think what I want most of all is fair and transparent pricing.  Don't tell me ""This is your price"", and then turn around and say ""... oh, but if you want it on more than one TV, you'll need to pay this much more.  And if you want a DVR, you'll need to pay this much more.  If you want your DVR to be able to skip commercials, you'll have to pay this much more on top of that.  And we have this surcharge for local channels.  What's that?  You have an antenna and you can get your own local channels?  Well, tough titty said the kitty, you're still paying for 'em.  Even if we can't offer you your local channels, you're still paying for them.  Oh, did you want to actually use that DVR on *all* your channels?  Because we can't give you that.""I'm kind of lumping it all together there, but between the cable company and the MVPDs, they're all guilty of at least part of the above.  And it's sickening.  Just give me a fair product at a fair price, and don't constantly raise it or nickel-and-dime me on extras."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I'm not really interested in something that straight up replaces cable. I think the ideal for me would be something that combines the CW app and CBS All Access. If each network offered an app that allowed you to watch the most recent episodes with ads for free, like CW, but also offered a paid subscription that gave you ad-free and access to full season and their back catalog, I would support that.I don't mind watching the CW app. Sure, there's ads, but I can pause, and the ad breaks are still shorter than during broadcast. I can watch the episodes the day after they air, and as long as I don't fall behind I can watch the season as it airs.If each network did that ad-supported and free, I would be more willing to pay them to see older episodes and catch up on their other shows that I haven't seen. How much I'd be willing to to pay for a premium version would depend on what they offered in their back catalog. I might binge watch a few shows on one service while I had it for a few months, then cancel and use something else for a while. That's pretty much what I do now, rotating between Netflix, HBO Now, Hulu and others, depending on what's current to watch."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,I just want the damn hunting channel and the outdoor network... Reliability would be a huge plus as well.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"A good interface and a cheap price.  So far, Philo has impressed me."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I'm starting to feel cable/satellite is a pretty good value if you could get by using your cell phone for all your internet surfing needs. People are spending $55 a month for high speed internet, $11 a month for netflix, $10 a month for hulu, $12/mo on Amazon Prime... on top of a $80/mo cell phone bill... So now instead of just paying $90 a month for cable was are paying $55+11+12+10 a month for an inferior service. I guess one could use just their mobile devices for streaming but the quality will not be the same as broadband or satellite... of course, this is assuming all shows are watched legally.... but back on topic.... I would want access to everything for cheap. That is all. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"ZERO commercials.  If I'm paying for it, they don't need to bombard me with ads."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,No ads
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Youtube Tv without the geolocation nazism 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Stability. I NEVER want to have to worry about missing a live event (sports) due to buffering, ever. On my 200Mbps connection (excellent router, hardwired connection to streaming device) I have yet to find a stable streaming cable replacement."

I can access everything very easily on my TV, on desktop, or on mobile devices. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Reasonable price, and no buffering issues. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Hulu Live fan here. Local channels, decent movies, and plenty of streaming choices."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I have been pretty satisfied with OTA, and our streaming services (Hulu, Netflix, and Amazon Prime). I am using a Tablo DVR with the OTA signal, so I can skip commercials. I had DirecTV Now, and even though the service was OK I really didn't like paying $35/month for a bunch of channels filled with commercials.The only thing that gives me anxiety is knowing that I probably won't see the new season of Always Sunny as it airs on FX. I'll have to wait for however long it takes to be released on Hulu. That being said, I don't think I'm willing to pay more for it (either ala carte or through subscription)."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Direct channel entry.  I can do it on my aerials, so why not with DTVN or other things?  PlutoTV has channel numbers, but Roku doesn't support direct channel number entry."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"I'm mostly happy with what YTTV is currently offering but I'd love a few a la carte options for stuff like AXSTV and the Pac 12 network (during football and basketball).NFL and Red Zone would also be popular and I would add those too, and they'd be expensive so I wouldn't want them to be mandatory. It would also be nice to dump them in the offseason which is probably why that deal wouldn't work, though it does with Sling.I'm willing to do two services - I had Sling Orange to get AXS and Pac-12 until they raised the price. But in that case I'd love to see some kind of single launch guide. Philo is particularly interesting to me but they don't even have a proper Android TV app.Also I'd love the option of being able to subscribe to one out of region RSN. I am a huge Boston sports fan and would do anything for NESN."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Access to sports and shows.  I don't care about network affiliation or any of that,  ABC, CBS, Netflix, Amazon Prime, youtube, are all garbage middle men.  "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Ad free.  If it does have ads it should be free to consumers.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Reliability.  PQ. Content. DTVN was an epic fail when I was trialing. Sling had slow framerate.  Vue was solid. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Affordability more than anything. Even with many of the Cable replacements, I have to get the highest tiers to get the channels I watch the most. Lately, I watch TBS, FXX, Velocity, HBO, and the local channels. From what I've found, I still need to have the highest tiered packages."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Honestly?  Just Hallmark.  The fiance demands it around Christmas, so I've resigned myself to paying for some sort of service that carries it 2 or 3 months out of the year.  I'd use their streaming service if they actually put the new movies on it, but they don't, so it's shit.Since the only options that include real Hallmark are all around $40, then I need enough extras to make that $40 worth it.  DVR, some other channels I might actually watch, etc.If there was a real on-demand service that got all the new Hallmark movies, then all the cable-like services could go die in a fire as far as I care."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"If you're talking about cable TV, what we wanted was lots more and better content options, on demand, rather than some corporation's fixed schedule, and without the need to record stuff ourselves. We also prefer being able to pause, rewind, fast forward, and possibly resume a show weeks later where we left off (like Netflix offers, and few others, as yet). We also wanted fewer (preferably zero) commercials; but we also want the service to be a bargain, and ultra reliable.After years of research and watching the relevant news, and trying things out, today we possess much of all that with several Rokus, a Netflix sub, a OTA antenna, and a broadband connection, as well as a Windows PC to get anything not available through all that, online. However, Netflix is increasingly making us consider replacing them with something else. At present, I'm watching lots more free Crunchyroll than Netflix, despite preferring live action shows, because Netflix simply isn't delivering what I want."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"NBC SN, reasonable user interface and reliability. I'm OK with having video quality go down periodically, but it still needs to be available. I have a gig internet connection at my house so instantly blaming my connection when everything else is fine is what turned me off of YouTube TV along with a terrible user interface. Pressing B on the Xbox did about 5 different things depending on which screen you were which was hugely aggravating.I'm happy with Hulu for the time being. "

What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Easy DVR
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"DVR that actually works 100% of the time. This is the thing that always brings me back to cable, is DVR functionality.I had ""College Basketball"" as a show recording on PS Vue. I had something I had to do during the national championship game but I knew it would be recorded just like all the other March Madness games had been. When I returned home two hours after the game started, I selected the game, was informed (for the first time) that the game was not authorized to be recorded, and saw Villanova being awarded the trophy. I canceled PS Vue the next fucking day and I got cable in time for football season :( I like live sports but don't plan my life around them, so for me, I get cable during football season now."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,All Sports for the cheapest package possible
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Mostly my locals for a low price.  I can't put up an antenna that could pick them up easily, so it would be nice to have a straight streaming option.  There are very few other channels I would care to pay for on a monthly basis.  I realistically watch maybe one or two shows that go out on a normal cable network.  For those it is easier and cheeper to just buy the seasons, or wait until they come to Amazon Prime."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Zero blackout restrictions on sports.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,I'm not meaning this in a condescending way but:Change of lifestyle. It's the best replacement. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"A 100% pure sports packageESPN, ESPN2, FS1, NBCSN, CBS Sports, Pac12, Big10, SEC, NFL/MLB/NBA/NHL network, and local RSN with no blackouts (both RSNs I want dont stream on any package and are not available in my area w/o satellite). Maybe add in a BeIn sports or something else along those lines. I'd gladly pay $24.99 a month for this.I can get my local NFL team and local channels with an antenna and that would be all I'd ever want."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"No chance in hell would that cost 24.99, atleas not in today’s climate. You’ve literally just listed out 12 of the probably top 20 most watched cable networks. The huge reason the reason tv is so expensive is because of those networks. "
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,"Sports channels (RSNs too), and ONLY the sports channels."
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Price. There is no reason why cable should cost more than all my other utilities.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Free.
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,Being realistic I want bundles that make sense for me. I don't need ESPN or Disney so why should they pay the high fees for me to have it? I don't mind a bunch of cheap crap channels...if they're in the genres I pick. 
What do you most desire from a cable replacement service?,No stupid fucking packages. Let me pick the channels I want one by one. I’m sick of having channels rammed down my throat that I’ll never watch. But I get them bc I want one or two channels on that particular package. Fucking irritates the shit out of me
HDHR QUESTION,how are you getting the signal from the hdhr to the apple tv?  Seems like that is the only variable between the set ups.
HDHR QUESTION,"I really appreciate your reply!. My hdhr is connected by the supplied ethernet cable to my netgear nighthawk 6900 v2 gigabit router. I'm getting signals to all my devices the same way. I think I've found a solution. I checked the hdhr app on the apple tv and noticed an update was available. I have all my apps set to update automatically but I'm guessing the hdhr is an exception. When I updated, the channel I was having a problem with now works perfectly with the subs also. Have no idea if it was just luck that it corrected it or an actual bug that was fixed. Just FYI: The new update also includes a preview of their premium streaming service. Looks very interesting, great selection of live networks, didn't seem to buffer, etc. Seems like it may be a great solution to tie in local networks OTA with the Live network streams and a guide built in that shows both in the same guide. Thanks again for the help!"
Plan to cut the cord,Tablo offers a lifetime guide. I believe it cost $150. 
Plan to cut the cord,"PBS and PBS Kids do have Roku apps, but I know episodes are limited to a few unless you donate to PBS to gain unlimited access on a monthly basis.  Go to your local PBS website and it should have information on the 'donation' amount.    edit:  It is called Passport.  Here is the info copied from PBS.org:    ""Passport is an added benefit available to donors in the United States that contribute an annual tax-deductible gift of $60 or more, or an ongoing gift of $5 per month as sustaining members."""
Plan to cut the cord,"The PBS app is on demand only. It has a fair amount of stuff but some content, especially older episodes are only in Passport. (You donate to your local PBS and get more access). The PBS Kids app is also free but also has a live stream as well as on demand episodes. Note that getting PBS via antenna also means you get the subchannels too. Both apps are on the Roku. "
Plan to cut the cord,My main focus is on PBS kids for my child. Live stream meaning you can stream what's airing live on PBS?
Plan to cut the cord,Your local PBS is free if you have an antenna and a decent signal. Also you can look into ways to DVR those shows off the antenna for later binging with your kids. See the sidebar info. The passport and Roku are cool but not the only way so both may be doable. 
Plan to cut the cord,"I have Tablo to DVR my local channels.  GO to Tablotv.com for information about Tablo.  You can check Homerun HD, I think it might have a DVR.Tablo is a great tool for OVA tv and recording."
Plan to cut the cord,This depends on how tech savvy you arem. I am using my Nvidia  shield as a Plex server. If you need an simple all on one solution get a Tablo. it might. It be ideal for channel surfing as it slow to change channels. 
Plan to cut the cord,I don't think there is a Roku that does antenna TV. Normally you would connect an antenna directly to the television.
Fox Airs First Promotion For ‘Superfan’ Streaming Service,"I think I threw up a little reading that.Imagine being a ""superfan"" of any cable news station, let alone Fox News (as Jon Stewart so aptly put it, ""The lupus of news"")."
Fox Airs First Promotion For ‘Superfan’ Streaming Service,"Bleck. I just read the headline and thought this was similar to FX+ but for Fox shows. After I read the whole thing, pass. "
Fox Airs First Promotion For ‘Superfan’ Streaming Service,If it's free guess I'll give it a try. We've had Sling tv since it began. Can't get Fox News without a bloated cable package here. No problem getting all the other news networks. Fox isn't what it once was either though. Not sure any of the big ones are
Which of these modems would you recommend?,You’re probably buffering because of the lack of channels within your modem. Get more than 8 and you should be good. 
Which of these modems would you recommend?,Thing is a month ago I wasn't buffering at all. I've has the modem since 2016 and nothing has changed internet-use wise.
Which of these modems would you recommend?,"I personally use a Zoom 5345, and it works great for me.  I did have to upgrade my router though.  I got the Netgear AC1750, and it works great.  I still have on order a gigabit NIC for my Plex server, since it only has a 100/10 NIC in it.  Damn, I've spent more on my network in the last week than I have in the last decade.  Simply because I got ""too fast"" of an internet connection that my existing eqipment isn't physically capable of handling."
Which of these modems would you recommend?,Can't go wrong with a Zoom
Which of these modems would you recommend?,"I can tell you which modems to avoid: [https://www.approvedmodems.com/do-not-buy-list.html](https://www.approvedmodems.com/do-not-buy-list.html)So 150Mbps is on the top end of what the 6141 can handle and while nothing has changed on your side, cable being a shared connection can be impacted by your neighbors.  Especially if they have received new DOCSIS 3.1 modems and subscribed to more bandwidth.   Provided you don't wan't to pay up ($200+) for a docsis 3.1 modem , the Netgear would probably be my choice.  A 16x4 modem allows it some choice in which channel to use to give you 150Mbps.There is a big catch-22 in buying your own modem, while there may be a firmware fix for all of these modems, your provider may refuse to load it because it isn't their equipment."
Which of these modems would you recommend?,You can get a new SB6183 for $62 on Amazon. I’ve used that modem for the last year with no issues. 
Which of these modems would you recommend?,"What router are you using? Not saying your modem isn't the culprit here, it may very well be. But in my experience, poor speeds are usually due to internal network issues."
Which of these modems would you recommend?,Its probably the router causing the problems but on that list I would get the refurb 6183 as long as there is a return period. Basically refurb modems either work properly or not right away. 
Which of these modems would you recommend?,An SB-6190 is just under $100 at Bestbuy.  I replaced an older modem with that and my speeds were better and more consistent on the same plan.
"Looking to cut the cord. Need some help on internet speed, modems/routers, and streaming box decisions. Any advice is appreciated!",Get an Nvidia shield if you can afford it. Well worth the $179. Handles 4k hdr like a champ
"Looking to cut the cord. Need some help on internet speed, modems/routers, and streaming box decisions. Any advice is appreciated!",$179 is a bit pricey. Especially given the fact that I don't think I would utilize the Shield to its full potential since I don't really game or use a media hub/server. 
"Looking to cut the cord. Need some help on internet speed, modems/routers, and streaming box decisions. Any advice is appreciated!","This is the [gateway](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00J65WQHU/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_c_api_5e0FBb3W245KJ)  we have at our house and it works perfectly. Budget permitting, you could bump it up to the AC1900, but I don’t think you’ll be too disadvantaged with the AC1750. As far as 4K streaming, 60 or 150 Mbps will be sufficient for one stream. If you’re expecting multiple streams, I don’t think the price difference between the two speeds is enough to not jump to 150 (it costs me $10 more a month). Of course, be conscious of your data allotment if you live in a data-capped region. As far as Rokus, I don’t personally prefer them. I have the Roku streaming Stick and it struggles with 1080p 60fps on Twitch and Youtube. The model you have (being 4K-compatible) is beefier than mine, so hopefully you don’t experience the same issue. I’ve tried almost every streaming device under the sun and prefer the Apple TV the most, followed by the Chromecast. But if Roku works for you, you do you. Incidentally, don’t stress too much about not having Ethernet to your device. Even with 4K being larger files, you’ll fair just fine without a hard-wire connection. I can’t speak to Roku anymore than what I’ve already said. Edit: auto-correct correction"
"Looking to cut the cord. Need some help on internet speed, modems/routers, and streaming box decisions. Any advice is appreciated!","That looks like a really nice gateway, but a bit pricey. Would you happen to have any recommendations under roughly $100? Or would I be better off buying a modem and a router separately in that case?As far as 4K streaming goes, there will only ever be one 4K stream at a time (the TV). Any other simultaneous streaming on laptops, phones, and desktops will be in 1080 at the most. The price difference between 60 and 150 Mbps where I live is $15/month but I figured if I didn't need the extra speed, why not save the money instead. Given all that, do you think 60 Mbps is sufficient?"

'Featured Free' offers a glimpse into Roku's future,"This is one reason I think the Apple TV ""app"" is underrated.  You could add Pluto TV, Tubi TV and a few others to the app and get a really beautiful UI of all the free content.  Compared to Roku's sliver of a few things, the Apple TV app puts all of it there.Now say you subscribe to a few premium channels like Amazon Video or Hulu- you can add those and get literally tens of thousands of things through that one interface.I know it's not 100% perfect, Netflix is absent from the app, but for me it's a big step in the right direction to simply the discovery experience.(Different subject but I still think the Apple TV is way underrated.  I own every device, and by far the PQ is the best.)"
Question: does anyone only use their phone for TV?,We have when the internet service (satellite at the time) went down for days. Now we have an AT&T Home Base on our cell phone bill which is our current internet service.

Question: does anyone only use their phone for TV?,">illuminate your home internet billIf you start it on fire it will illuminate, but only for a short time."
Question: does anyone only use their phone for TV?,"If you really want to go for the minimum, AT&T doesn't count the data you use when watching DirecTV Now on phones and tablets (including tethered). They also give you steep discounts when you add it to certain phone plans. So what you can do is tether a Chromecast and an otherwise unused phone to your primary cell phone. Then cast the entire spare phone to the TV and pull up DirecTV Now. You don't even have to pay for service on the tethered phone.Don't use the cast feature within the app -- that counts against your data. Cast the entire phone and pull up the app. The endpoint as far as DirecTV Now is concerned is the phone not the TV. Turn on your hotspot when you come home and you've got a great TV lineup for about $10 a month. Samsung Smart TVs can also detect HDHomeRun devices, so if you feed your WiFi with a wireless bridge grabbing WiFi off your phone, you can also watch your local channels without using your phone's Internet connection. There's so much you can do if you really need to push it to extremes. "

‘Veronica Mars’ Revival Series in the Works at Hulu,"It received a lot of good reviews, including Stephen King who said: Is there anything more horrifying than high school?- I personally thought the 1st season was good, but once the mystery was solved, the show became directionless.  (The season 2, 3 mysteries were not as good.)  I observed Prison Break has the same flaw."
‘Veronica Mars’ Revival Series in the Works at Hulu,"Why would you assume it wasn't? It's really well-written with a ton of very engaging characters, a solid cast, fantastic self-contained episodes that exist within - and in many cases feed into - larger arcs that are also excellent.

Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"The lack of Roku support, even if you have an HDHomeRun Extend with transcoding functionality, is definitely a problem they need to fix.But otherwise most of the downsides listed in this article would be viewed as an upside for those that the HDHomeRuns were made for. Power users that wanted a network tuner that can tie into advanced local DVR setups like Plex or Channels. Being able to locally record cable channels is a huge upside for many people.Is it a concern that they might not get enough subscribers to cover the licensing costs? Maybe, but I doubt Silicon Dust would've launched this service if they didn't already account for this. They know exactly the kind of people that buy their hardware, and they tailor made this service just for them. The math must've made sense for them, or they wouldn't have done it."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"Nailed it right here.  This service isn't necessarily meant to displace options like Vue, Sling, etc.; it's meant to be a value-add for the HDHomeRun hardware.  And honestly, to me, being able to have everything in one app, and not having to switch between, say, the HDHomeRun app and the Vue app, is a fantastic thing.Also, to me at least, being able to record directly to hardware I control is a feature, not a problem.  I'd honestly rather have that than deal with the vagaries of cloud DVR."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"Word from zatznotfunny is they're whitelabelled another IP-TV service, so they haven't done the negotiations with content providers directly.That said, there's no technical reason they couldn't stream directly to another device and set up a cloud DVR option.  Seems like they're rolling things out gradually while they build up the infrastructure to support those features down the road.They've got a single-box network DVR (like Tablo) on the way, so this would let them have cable channel add-ons for that too."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"IMHO, their biggest mistake was rolling this out with half their channels in one time zone and half in the other. That is just stupid IMHO and seems like just a purely lazy implementation.The second biggest mistake, or maybe tied for first, is lack of third party support. Sure, I know it is coming (hopefully), but outside of hacks that still don't deliver 100% functionality due to the above timezone issue, the only way to use the service right now officially is live through the native, and kind of crappy, app, which of course requires direct LAN connectivity to the HDHR. They should have worked with these third party companies from the get go so things were ready for release. And maybe actually beta test with customers so they wouldn't have to redo all their website info/FAQ when people started complaining about the issues they found within minutes of release.And in third place for bad decisions -- the price. At $25, this would be amazing. $30 is probably still fair for all the sports stuff. But $35? That is what most people pay YTTV for and they get many more channels, out of the box functionality across basically everything, and 9-month DVR (yes, I know VOD sucks). Now granted, rumor has it Google is losing money on YTTV even at the $40 price point, so maybe HDHR's $35 is what the minimum sustainable rate is, with some profit, for what they deliver. But competition is getting fierce and while they do offer something no one else does, and I love the idea of roll your own DVR, they are limiting themselves to a niche demographic already, so pricing people out isn't the best idea. And while I know many people love ESPN and sports, I think that they would have been much better to do a Philo-like roll out initially ($20 or so) without the sports stuff and then offered the rest as add-ons.IMHO of course."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"Oh, and don't get me started on them counting QVfuckingC as one of the ""40 Channels"" they offer. Seriously?"
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"> IMHO, their biggest mistake was rolling this out with half their channels in one time zone and half in the other. That is just stupid IMHO and seems like just a purely lazy implementation.Yeah, that's a big problem right there.  Living in the Central time zone, a Pacific channel is kind of useless to me except as a DVR source."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"Nope.  Not if you're looking for a basically ""drop in"" replacement for cable.  You get all your locals, (whatever you can get via aerial), plus cable channels.  Paired with a Plex server and a Roku, it's almost exactly cable.  For persons willing to take the time to set it up and configure it, it's almost perfect."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"This is actually perfect for me - have everything show up in my Plex setup. Only if they had Fs1 and NBC Sn, I'd jump on this in a heartbeat and supplement it with Philo. "
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"It's not the streaming service that is not supported on Roku, but HDHomeRun itself. I've had an HDHomeRun box for about a year now (for OTA antenna), and I have not been able to find an app on my Roku for just that (which is the same app the streaming service uses). The only way I have been able to watch live TV on my Roku from my HDHomeRun is through Plex, but it's not very good with the transcoding. So live TV (OTA or streaming) I watch on my Fire TV (I go the Roku for free, and used it when I had a subscription to Philo since that wasn't supported on Fire TV at the time)."
Is Silicon Dust Streaming Service Making A Big Mistake?,"More and more, it feels like SiliconDust has burned its bridges with other companies. There's no fundamental technical reason not to have a roku app, or its unceremonious dumping from Samsung TVs, or attempting to compete with mythtv, or closing its subreddit. Instead of giving their customers the roku-based dvr frontend they've been clamoring for, they're trying to turn their tuners into streaming boxes in a crowded market headed straight for a shakeout.Well good luck with that."
Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),"Tablo can do this. Only with the apps though, not the web browser since their web app loads via the web. The Tablo only needs the internet to download the guide, but if you subscribe it can store up to 14 days of guide data locally, and even without guide data you should still be able to load the live channels and manually set recordings.Obviously you'll need a WiFi router to connect the Tablo and tablets to though."
Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),"I don't know how often, but Tablo seems to want to connect back to the Internet periodically. One time when I tried to use it from my Apple TV it had an error message along the lines of needing an Internet connection. I was connected to the local Tablo device, but it wouldn't let me browse live channels or anything until I got my Internet back up. It was only one time, and it has worked when the Internet was down before then and since -- I think long periods of Internet outage may be an issue for it though."
Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),"Amazon does sell a few external tuners meant for tablets. Not sure how well they work. If you do buy these, make sure it accepts an external antenna not a built one (those are tiny and useless). Make sure it is for the US market if in US. They also sell 7 to 10 inch small tv units [like this](https://www.amazon.com/GJY-Widescreen-Headphone-Detachable-Automotive/dp/B07C75QJTR/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&qid=1535035958&sr=8-19&keywords=dvd+player+with+antenna) that have a tuner and coax connector (a few portable DVD players do too). Typically these are between 7 to 10 inch and cost between $65 and $120. Some of these also have card slots or USB ports too. Walmart has these too and has a generous return policy if you keep all of the packing materials. "

Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),If they have a antenna then you can use the plex live piece to stream whatever the antenna picks up.

Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),You will have to setup a WLAN in the camper for them & hookup an HDHomeRun to their external OTA antenna & the WLAN.  They will have to use an alternative guide like TV Titan but it won't record or do anything fancy. We use a TiVo at home and on the road which has an app so we can view live shows or pre-recorded content but it needs internet at least every other week to update the guide or it won't record automatically. There are TiVo apps to view it on tablets and phones. 
Any way to stream antenna TV to a tablet with NO internet access (LAN only),"silicondust has their own app, may check that.  Airtv has a stand alone app as well.  Don't know if they will work without internet or not, certainly no guide data except what comes over the air."

"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix","I had Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video for the last few years.

"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix","Same, Netflix is included w/ T-mobile and my bill wouldn't be any cheaper without it.  I keep Hulu as a sort of backup DVR since it'll usually have something the next day I might've forgotten to record.And then Amazon Prime because I'd get it for the shipping any way.  Also I'm happy at them for saving The Expanse."
"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix","I sub to Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll. Prime video comes along with Amazon Prime.

"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix",I only have amazon.

"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix","I have Netflix, Hulu, Amazon.  I'll be subbing to CBS all access when star trek comes back.  I cancelled Direct TV Now due to sucky quality and i cancelled Hulu live since we weren't watching it.  I just cancelled movie pass as well."
"The services we canceled this year, from MoviePass to Netflix",OTA and amazon prime are the constants. I had Netflix monthly also For several years but I grew bored with the majority of the content. I now pick up a month a couple times a year. Hulu never lasts  for me beyond their free trial. I do that once a year. HBO whenever GOT is on although this year I might grab a month. Showtime whenever billions is on. I willcatch up on shameless then too.  I probably will try another subscription if I find something interesting. 
Questions about AT&T Unlimited and WatchTV,"You create a separate login for WatchTV after you start your unlimited plan. I chose HBO, and I can use my AT&T WatchTV credentials for HBO Go. I can't speak for Showtime, but I would assume it would work in a similar fashion.I'm not sure about Roku, but I hope they add it soon.

FuboTV just added Turner Networks - keeps price flat.,I feel like even if you subscribe you won't see all the games. Things have gotten worse. NBC kicked many games over to gold. Turner is only showing some UEFA and only the final of Europa. Whats the point of paying any more? Not since before NBC first got the EPL rights have things been this bad.
FuboTV just added Turner Networks - keeps price flat.,I’ve tried almost every OTT provider out there and FuboTV is my most liked but I don’t subscribe to it. The video quality and guides are the best UX I’ve seen on the Apple TV.

Is the picture quality on the HDHomeRun Premium TV service just as bad on the non preview channels?,"I haven't subscribed to the service but I have looked at the previews and read/posted about it. I'm pretty sure that the preview channels are the actual, real live streams, the same thing you'd get if you subscribed, except that non-subscribers are cut off after about 2.5 minutes and shown a commercial for the service. All that to say: yep, I'm pretty sure the picture quality won't be any better if you subscribe. Some folks have raised the issue of the low bitrates/PQ to HDHomeRun on Twitter and they responded that they hope to improve that in the future. As for times, I think they may be streaming the Pacific feeds for some channels and the Eastern feeds for others. Something they need to get straightened out.  Seems like it would be pretty easy to do."
Is the picture quality on the HDHomeRun Premium TV service just as bad on the non preview channels?,"I purchased the service and I use the Channels app on an Apple tv.  Nick, the dev, was asked about the picture quality and this was his response after indicating this was his highest priority:&#x200B;Hi guys,The initial 5000 number comes from an internal rollout plan relating to servers and bandwidth at launch. The scaling plan which will kick off once we have verified real-world performance of every part of the system.Nick&#x200B;Edit:  'Scalability is one of the hardest issues in providing Live media distribution, and it sounds like Silicon Dust is limiting the expansion of their Premium TV service, to have better management over Quality of Service than other Services have previously. Sling TV, DTVN, etc. have tried to outpace each other's expansion in the field, to the detriment of their subscribers. Silicon Dust obviously has a more responsible plan, and seems more interested in quality than quantity. Good choice.'&#x200B;This exactly!"
Is the picture quality on the HDHomeRun Premium TV service just as bad on the non preview channels?,"I disagree with everyone else. As soon as I subscribed, I noticed the framerate was much better with much smoother motion and less jitter. There were still pixellation and bitrate issues but not as bad as the demo channels. Over the past couple of days, I've noticed some definite improvement in PQ since Sunday's launch. Still not perfect, but perfectly acceptable now. The channel tuning speed is crazy fast too. Edit: the most annoying thing to me now is the guide data only goes out like 3 hours. "

Clearstream 2v,"If I’m understanding properly, I’m aiming the antenna at majority of the towers and if it were to turn it 180 degrees backwards it would be aiming at the other two towers I’m struggling to pickup. So your saying it can pickup signal in front and in the back equally ?"
Clearstream 2v,"The 2V has a reflector. So it likely has a main lobe off the front. This lobe is probably fairly wide though. Terms like ""mulit-directional"" are usually mostly about marketing.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai's decision to deregulate the broadband industry eliminated that complaint option and also limited consumers' rights to sue Internet providers over unjust or unreasonable behavior.It's also mentioned in the article that the only reason it wouldn't have been a net neutrality violation is because there is a loophole in the rules to allow it.

Verizon throttled fire department’s “unlimited” data during Calif. wildfire,"Give Emergency Services i.e., Police/Fire/EMS/etc a seperate tier or band of connection so they don't need to throttle.  Problem solved.  Throttling happens because a company has a limited bandwidth to distribute to x number of customers and decides to throttle a customer using y number of gigs to stop other customers who arent abusing the system from lossing speed.  Verizon cant distinguish who is an average joe and who is the FD they treat every customer the same (just like NN advocates want)."

Verizon throttled fire department’s “unlimited” data during Calif. wildfire,"Net neutrality advocates never demanded that all *customers* be treated the same. Net Neutrality is about preventing Comcast from treating different packets from *the same* customer differently based on what's in them, or what their destination is.So it's not about me being treated the same as the firefighter, it's about my packets going to/from Reddit being treated the same as my packets going to/from Youtube or Netflix. Because Youtube and Netflix aren't Comcast customers, they're *destinations* that Comcast customers are trying to reach. At the other extreme, it's a violation of net neutrality for T-Mobile to zero-rate Netflix (and not charge you for Netflix bandwidth).If I want to pay extra for some higher tier (or give it to the firefighters for free), with an SLA and everything, that's fine. So long as it applies to anything those firefighters want to access, there's no net neutrality issue."

How are the ads on youtube tv vs ps vue?,"If you're watching a live channel, the ads are pretty much the same on every service. The channel itself puts the ad breaks in and the streaming services just pass along the live feed. If you're watching a NFL game on CBS for example, the ad breaks will be the same whether you're watching over an antenna, through a cable/satellite provider or through a streaming service like YoutubeTV/PSVue.The people who complain about ads on YoutubeTV are talking about the DVR/VOD content. With YTTV you have unlimited space in your cloud DVR, but everything expires 9 months after airing. When you watch a DVR'ed program, you can fast forward through commercial breaks. The catch is that if the channel you recorded a show from uploads a VOD version of the same show/episode, they will usually lock you out of watching the DVR'ed copy and force you to watch the VOD version of the same episode instead. The VOD version has commercials inserted with fast forwarding disabled, so that's what people complain about.I have YTTV and I don't mind the ads (I used to watch most my stuff on Hulu with ads so its not much different when I'm watching VOD stuff on YTTV). For most sports (like NFL games), the network doesn't bother to upload VOD copies, so I'm free to watch the DVR'ed copy and fast forward freely."
How are the ads on youtube tv vs ps vue?,"PSVue has all the national commercials, they interject their own on occasion but most of the time when the networks go to a localized break you just get a “commercial break in progress loop.”On cable you get a lot of “hey watch our movie channels” commercials, these don’t occur on Vue.

Twenty-two states ask U.S. appeals court to reinstate 'net neutrality' rules,Unfortunately no because the authority to regulate such things belongs to the FCC.  Nobody else is allowed to enact or enforce communication related regulations but the FCC.  That is a large contributing factor as to why this is such a shit-show.

Twenty-two states ask U.S. appeals court to reinstate 'net neutrality' rules,"States lack the authority to regulate that sort of thing, like /u/gamergeek pointed out.What states are doing instead is saying that any ISP that operates inside their state and does business with _any_ government entity must also follow net neutrality rules in the state for _all_ its customers in that state.  So if Comcast wants to do business with the State of Washington at any level, Comcast must follow net neutrality principles for _all_ of its customers in Washington State.  It's a shitty end-run around the FCC regulations, and one that most ISPs, if it becomes a serious issue, can simply spin off a ""government ISP"" business that doesn't accept residential/commercial customers to avoid those sorts of rules."

Twenty-two states ask U.S. appeals court to reinstate 'net neutrality' rules,"Speed is not the important metric or why people demand net neutrality.  Lack of neutrality puts ISPs in a role as content gatekeepers for the internet, which is a _big_ fucking deal, and something that is new to the way the internet has worked up until the repeal.  The effects of the repeal itself won't be seen for some time, though Verizon's [suddenly different definitions of 'unlimited'](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/13/unlimited-data-plan-caps-verizon-att-tmobile-sprint.html) are a good example of where traffic prioritization, preferential treatment, and throttling are going to take us.While ""congestion"" slowing is generally acceptable, almost all wireless carriers are, or are reportedly planning to again attempt content-based throttling, which ain't okay."

The ""internet"" does not exist as a distinct entity that can be easily quantified in such a way; with investments in technology like 5G continuing to move forward, WISPs continuing to increase rural internet access, and municipal broadband investments demonstrating a positive ROI, I have no doubt that the ""internet"" has ""improved"" *for some*.

AT&T could decide that my Netflix stream should be slowed down or cut off because they would prefer I used Hulu.  That's too much power to be left in the hands of a private company.  The power company can't tell me which refrigerator brand I can plug in, so why should the ISP be allowed to tell me which web services are allowed?We have lots of choices when it comes to social media.  The only power they have is the power we give them.  Facebook might seem like they control everything, but if you don't like it, you are free to leave.

PBS too."
Philo + ESPN Plus,"I love ESPN+ for soccer coverage. MLS, Serie A, USL, English Championship, FA Cup and more. Can’t beat it for $50 a year. Best deal in sports streaming. I’m currently on the DirecTV Now, ESPN+ combo because I need to watch big ten football and basketball too, but if soccer was my only sport I’d probably do what you’re doing."
Philo + ESPN Plus,For sure . Hope they keep adding content. Go Huskers!
Philo + ESPN Plus,"Don’t you first need an active ESPN subscription on cable/sat/streaming before you can add ESPN Plus? That’s the way it was originally marketed. It doesn’t include programming on ESPN, ESPN2, etc., it’s all (lesser) supplemental stuff not being broadcast."

"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","YTTV + Philo is basically perfect, minus the DVR issues on YTTV."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Agreed, except we don't find the VOD that much of a problem. Would it be better to have straight DVR? Sure. But for everything else that comes along with YTTV, we can live with that. Also, some of the networks VOD recordings (I'm looking at you FX), have ad breaks are very short...you don't even have time to go pee...lol"
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Out of the three you're considering, Hulu w/ live TV is the best. You gain access to both their live services and VOD offerings. Didn't like PSVue all that much and I've never tried Sling TV"
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Using all of them, PSVue stands out.  Hulu is fine, but I tried it before they redid the UI and the live TV access sucked before that but I understand the UI is supposed to be better now.  Hulu was a bit more expensive because DVR with ability to skip commercials is $15, but it includes HULU VOD library.So if you use Hulu a lot already, the try them out as it’s nice to have it all in one service and live TV is very stable.  But my other choice is Vue as a stand-alone service.That being said, they all have different channel availability so first figure out what channels you want, then see who offers them, then compare pricing.DirecTV Now has eastern feeds of “cable” channels and Vue has western (at least in California) which is one detail that affected me (program schedules.)  DTV NOW also has one of the most comprehensive channels offerings for the package price IMO.  But DTV Now is also probably one of the most problematic.No one is a clear winner.  Compare based on channel offerings and go from there.YoutubeTV is great but the DVR is usually just VOD (with ads) and they don’t have the channels I want.  Philo is fine with great DVR/VOD but very limited channel selection.  Still if DVR isn’t important and they have your channels, YTTV might be a good choice."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Agree with what you said, but to be fair, YTTV usually converts DVR recordings to VOD with prime time first run shows on network tv. The cable channels and non-prime time shows are typically available as DVR recordings and not VOD but it depends on the network and time slot. "
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","YoutubeTV has every major channel I want. Yes, it would be nice to have Comedy Central and NHL Network but I can live without them. I've yet to have any technical issues in 6+ months of having it. Unless a missing channel is a dealbreaker to you, I'd go with YTTV."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",Thanks for your input! Comedy Central is a basic requirement for me though.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","I used to subscribe to YTTV and Philo but earlier this month I switched to Hulu Live and kept Philo as well for the Viacom channels. I've watched way more TV since doing this just bc Hulu has the older seasons of many of the shows I watch available and having Food Network, HGTV, Lifetime and A&E plus all 4 of my local channels all in one app makes everything easy. Also bc Hulu works on literally every device I own that makes a difference too. I'm undecided on if I will keep the expanded DVR or not when my trial of that is over. I think I will stick with Hulu though. I also have an antenna to get my locals but also like having them available in the app. I have also tried DTVN but it was a buggy mess and only had 2 local channels and a very buggy 20 hour DVR that just became widely available when I left them.  TLDR: I recommend either YouTube TV and Philo or Hulu Live and Philo"
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",i like vue the most. youtube tv probably second best direct now a distant third.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","For my needs PS Vue works well.  Sports is a big focus and it covers all the sports I need including regionals for the $50 Core plan.  And for this time of year it has the option to add NFL Redzone.  While some other services may sound cheaper in the base plans. Often by the time you upgrade to get Fox Sports regionals NFL network etc.  you are paying more.  The base 40 DTV Now for example jumps to at least $55 (maybe $65 if you want NBA TV) and doesn’t include all the for example with DTV Now with 3 less streams than $50 Vue.   YouTube TV covers sports well for $40.  But it was missing must haves for the wife like HGTV that Vue included and did not have NFL network which I want this time of year.  Of course if you don’t care much about sports none of that matters.Vue prices include things like 5 streams 28 day unlimited DVR, the ability to pause and rewind live TV (which options like DirecTV Now do not have) all included for that price.  Where most others upcharge to have more than 1 or 2 simultaneous streams or to have a DVR.  If you are perhaps single and don’t need lots of streams or don’t use DVR much you may not care.  But if you have a large family where multiple people are streaming it’s a consideration.  Also I find Vue and YTTV to be the most technically sound and reliable (I don’t have much experience with Sling and Hulu Live though).  Like Vue YTTV includes an unlimited DVR which goes out to 9 months!  And it includes 3 streams free which while not as much as Vue, it’s more than most offer.  The biggest issue with Vue would be if they have your local channels.  In my area (Dallas) we are spoiled in that every service but Sling has ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox affiliates (Sling doesn’t have CBS at all) so you will want to see what locals are in your area if that’s important. DirecTV Now covers the most overall content so you will need to think about that.  Take that for what it’s worth though as if you only watch 7 channels regularly having others “just in case” may not matter.  One of the most common things that comes up is DirecTV Now and Sling (both owned by cable companies) have Viacom channels where YTTV, Vue, and Hulu currently don’t.  There are ways around that though. adding $16 Philo can fill the Viacom gap for example.  Or I’ve found the little Viacom content we watched is available on free apps not needing a sign in.  That’s something you will need to evaluate."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","For value and compatibility (and what I have), Sling Blue is by far the best. For quality, YouTube TV is hard to beat."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",Take a look at philo also.  Its out if you're into sports or need local channels built in but its really inexpensive.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","Is there any restrictions on watching Philo? Like streaming limits, can you watch outside of home, is there a smartphone app etc. "
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",Do you already subscribe to Hulu? If so that would probably get my vote since it absorbs that cost into your Live sub.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","It depends on which channels you want. PS Vue, YouTube TV, Hulu with Live TV, and Philo are great. Sling and DirecTV Now suck. Sling has loud commercials, unreliable quality, and will at times randomly repeat the last few seconds of a stream before continuing. DirecTV Now has a useless DVR, streams that cut out, and a buggy guide that will fail to load from time to time. "
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",Hulu or YTTV
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","I've tried PS Vue, Sling, DirecTV Now, and Hulu (YTTV isn't available in my area), and PS Vue out performed those other services easily. Having said that, sign up for free trials and see which one you like the best."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",Anyone try Direct TV Now? Does it hold a candle to Hulu live?
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","I've used both (currently with DTVN) and honestly it just kind of depends on what's important to you.&#x200B;DTVN Pros: The best channel lineup of all the streaming services, arguably the best picture quality of all the services, reasonably priced for what you get, and&#x200B;DTVN Cons: Reliability (I've been fortunate enough to not really have any issues, but a lot of people do), DVR functionality can be hit or miss (again, I haven't had any problems thankfully) and is only 20 hrs, customer service sucks, only two streams unless you pony up more cash, you can't rewind live tv, and the UI isn't the best.&#x200B;Hulu Live Pros: Probably the best bang for your buck considering it's on the cheaper end of all of the services PLUS the rest of Hulu is available to you as well as part of your sub, you can rewind live tv, and the DVR is serviceable.&#x200B;Hulu Live Cons: Reliability (People complain often about hitches in the streams, again I haven't experienced these issues myself), UI is so-so, only two streams unless you pay for more, DVR is only 50 hrs, to make the channel lineup comparable to DTVN you'll have to sub to Philo for $16.&#x200B;Everybody feel free to add to the lists or call out and shame me for any inaccuracies."
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",YoutubeTV and supplement with Philo. Total is about 50$ combined.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",YTTV is $40 and Philo is $16 so I would very much like to know how you're getting away with only paying $50.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?",an antenna.
"What is the Best ""live TV"" Option in your opinion?","I've got one, but don't mind paying extra for some cable channels I also want. Thanks though."

Free Streaming Service Tubi Launches Branded Partner Channels called Tubi Channels,"Interesting, so it's like a completely free version of VRV and Amazon Channels. There's potential there. VRV has some free content, but it's not completely clear what's free or premium content, and many of the channels there are pretty much premium only for the most part.TubiTV has actually been getting pretty good lately, with a bunch of interesting stuff to watch. My only major criticism is that their browsing functionality is super clunky. They have a ton of categories, but they aren't organized in any way, not even alphabetically. Same issue with shows in those categories, as they also aren't sorted in any apparent way. For example, ignoring the fact that RWBY is included in the ""Anime"" category for some reason, volumes 1 and 3 of the show are listed next to each other, but you have to scroll way down to find volume 2. Almost makes you think they don't have volume 2 at all.So unless you already know exactly what you're looking for and use the search function, it's kinda hard to find shows. At the very least it'd be helpful if I could search for anime+romance or comedy+sci-fi, in order to narrow down results."
Free Streaming Service Tubi Launches Branded Partner Channels called Tubi Channels,They also have a deal with Hulu to bring in some content from that as well. (Signed a few months ago). I have a feeling this may replace Yahoo View. Although it may on be on the website version of TubiTv. Not sure. I have to find the article.

Help deciding a streaming box.,What about a universal remote or a sideclick if a Roku? Although the newer Roku Ultra and the Roku stick have both volume and power buttons on them. The stick is currently on sale.

Background and Offline playback is nice. But funny enough, I find myself using YouTube Music more than Google Play Music now. Many of the songs I listen to aren't available in Play Music for one reason or another, but they are available on YouTube, often as music videos, and YouTube Music lets me listen to all of them alongside other music as if they were normal music tracks. Nothing else has come close to it.Plus, one more benefit that makes me feel good is that my subscription revenue gets shared with the YouTubers I watch, even if their videos got demonetized by YouTube's mystery algorithms. Many of the YouTubers I've talked to say that YouTube Red/Premium revenue easily surpasses their ad revenue these days because of this."

Moving and going with Comcast - hardware advice,"The surfboard is what I have always seen recommended.   I have one and have never had an issue.

"Only internet I have is ATT wireless, want to use their directv unlimited data and watch on my TV, help?","You can AirPlay wirelessly from iPhone to an Apple TV or just connect it to a TV with HDMI cable and a $50 Apple AV adapter.  I’m sure Android has similar capabilities. EDIT: Actually the AirPlay or other wireless casting may not be feasible. To accomplish that, both devices are usually on the same WiFi network. But if you’re trying to use cell data to stream, WiFi would presumably be turned off on the phone. However, your phone is basically dedicated to those tasks when playing. And (IMO) you’re adding a LOT of wear an tear to the device with that volume of streaming. The stream also tends to be somewhat flakey. Pop-up alerts sent to your phone will probably appear on the TV. Some app prompts may even cause the stream to stop. "

Landlord restricts our cable provider on our lease? Illegal? Will they do anything?,"basically the properly owner is not allowing anyone else right of way into your unit, which is his right.  they used to do it for the small kickback they go from charter, but now they just do it because they don't want to deal with the premise installation hassle.  the kickback system that still exists depends on building penetration percentages, so once the owner makes an exception for a few people, he may lose the kickback from all the rest.   here in my 100 unit coop we had to guarantee charter would get >50% subs or no $10/mo kickback, so we dropped out of the program because we got fios, allow roof antennas, and host many old library goers, so there was no way to keep charter happy any longer.   if you are a property owner reading this, you should know that your rental property value goes higher once 2 or more ISP's are available to your unit holders, so being a butt head for a relatively tiny monthly kickback when you could be instead charging more rent/maintenance and enjoying higher flip taxes when shareholder sell - would be very short sighted of you..."

Apps are not allowed to directly accept credit cards for digital goods (e.g., a subscription fee) within the app. They also cannot use a credit card already on file somewhere else to charge for digital goods.So if Netflix displayed a credit card form directly in the app or displayed a ""Renew Now"" button that charged a credit card that Netflix somehow has on file, then they would get kicked out of the App Store. This is exactly why it's not possible to subscribe to Amazon Prime, subscribe to an Amazon Channel, or buy/rent a movie/show within the Amazon Prime Video app.There's no rule that says you can't tell the user how to subscribe outside of the app."
A better coax?,Well maybe or it’s your body acting as an antenna.  Back in olden times as a kid I used to stick the wires into my leg we had running off the tv to get a better signal to watch Star Trek.  Younger me would be aghast I’m dropping cable for antennae now heh
A better coax?,"LOL!I remember the same thing; we'd have to assume different positions, each kid holding onto and positioning one of the rabbit ears!  Ha!"
A better coax?,Try a shielded one from Home Depot or Amazon. 
A better coax?,Shielded?  You've peaked my interest!What is it?
A better coax?,The Leaf is probably missing any sort of thing to isolate the outside of the cable. So a different cable wouldn't help. If you bugs you get a good antenna.
A better coax?,RG-6 quad-shield cable is what I use for antenna signals. It reduces outside interference to the signal received by the antenna.
A better coax?,"the best coax is RG6U Quad Shielded, but that's typically used for long roof runs, not short patch cords.  there's   also 1ghz CATV rated coax that the cabletv companies use, but it's basically the same RG6U with less shielding."
A better coax?,"Hmmm🤔I actually have an extra Comcast coax, left over from some router malfunction.  Thanks!"
DirecTV to an OTA antenna,"Your antenna is now pointing toward the sky.  You'll want to remove the dish itself from that mount, so the antenna can be on the part of the pole that goes straight up toward the sky.Also, run a TV Fool report so you know which direction to point it, and also use your phone's compass app to point toward that direction."
DirecTV to an OTA antenna,"Dad wants me to ""test"" the antenna before positioning it "
DirecTV to an OTA antenna,"Just to clarify:   We just got our RCA antenna yesterday. It has a 70 mile range and it claims to do 4K. We tested it out in our RV and got 20 channels. The setup was a bit shit (8FT off ground), so the channels weren't coming in as good. So we went on the roof. We unplugged the DirecTV dish and replaced it with the antenna. Sadly we couldn't get the antenna to plug into the TV (the coaxial cable wouldn't go into the TV, it was set to go into the DirecTV box to unencrypt the signals from the dish). So now we have to wait for our HDHomeRun box to come so we can set it up on our network and replace the DirecTV box. I'll report back once I get the antenna set up with the HDHomeRun and Plex (NVIDIA Shield), and see how many channels we can get. "
DirecTV to an OTA antenna,Just so you know there is no such thing as an HD or 4k antenna and current broadcasting standard is limited to 1080i with only a few test markets broadcasting in 4k. 
DirecTV to an OTA antenna,> It has a 70 mile range ...That's obviously a gross exaggeration if you are comparing it with other antennas. Fortunately mileage ratings don't really mean anything...

"I got one of those cheapo amazon antennas, then found this sub... should I return it?","Well, how well is it working for you? I wouldn't return it without trying it out at least.Antenna recommendations are very difficult because there are so many variables in every home.

Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Why not rotate them? 
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Excellent! We do that with HBO. It would be very easy to do. Plus Netlfix posts a series' entire library, unlike CBS No Access.&#x200B;Edit: grammar"
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,I get Prime as a side benefit to shipping so I wouldn’t cut that. Hulu has current series for most networks but CBS so during the fall and spring is subscribe to Hulu and then pause and resume Netflix to catch up on original content. I do find most of the movies on Prime are the same as Hulu. 
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Someone told me that both Amazon and Hulu get movies from Epix. So, it's usually the same 20 movies on each for 30 to 45 days."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Of these three, I only have Hulu. I do sometimes subscribe to CBS All Access and I use Hoopla Digital etc.Regarding why:1. I didn't use Amazon Prime video much because frequently only one or two seasons of a tv show was available. I rarely watch movies. The price increase and the extra unwanted stuff (NFL and Twitch) made it less affordable. I typically didn't get Amazon Prime shipping in two days after an item shipped. (And the minimum is currently $25 so not too bad.)2. Hulu has a single stream HD plan for $7.99 (currently $5.99 for me) and I don't really care that much about ads or not since I already have ads on OTA anyway. It is nice when no ads is available but I don't feel like spending extra on it. I really didn't want to pay for an extra stream just to get HD and Netflix had dropped the shows I had been watching on catch up half way through the shows so then I had to turn to Hulu or Amazon to watch the end of the series. Secondly with Hulu, I generally don't have to wait a year. I strongly prefer on demand to Live Tv so even when i use CBS All Access, I don't watch live. So for me, cable tv with its equipment rental, horrible remotes, guides with ads, lousy closed captioning, lack of decent on demand, pricey plans, taxes and other fees is simply that similar to the streaming services that i use.  "
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Yeah, Amazon misses the two day promise sometimes.I remember when we decided to drop cable. I counted over 15 commercials in one HGTV break.We got in Hulu early, 2009. They had no ads only PSAs, it was so cool watching hour long shows in 45 minutes."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Netflix and Amazon. Netflix, because well... it's Netflix. Amazon as much because I read ebooks and shop online a lot, so Prime feels ""free"" (I know it's not, but it *feels* that way). Also my OTA TiVo gives me a better TV experience (**no** ads, better UI) than *either* Hulu plan. "
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"In our home, I'm having trouble with the Netflix angle. This thread will help tease out my thoughts. It IS Netflix, but...what's that mean anymore? As a market maker, they set terms. But I think they overstepped with the commercials and pushing so much original content, most of which is not that interesting to me."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Hulu and Netflix but with quick hops into Amazon for Mrs. Masisl and High Castle.
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,I sometimes subscribe for a month or two to a service and cancel to watch specific shows. 
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Prime because we'd use if for the shipping even without the video.  Hulu with live tv.  We like the interface and it works well for us. Wouldn't take Netflix if it was free.
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"We've had Hulu almost 10 years but have not looked at their live offering. At $30 ($40?)/month, what do you say is the appeal?"
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Thanks for the comments! It helps. After discussing, I am favorable to the rotation strategy. We already do the same with HBO. A true binge would be to rotate 4 or 5 services, subscribing to 2 or 3 at a time, over the course of a year. Catching up on Netflix in the Summer, HBO in the Fall...&#x200B;edit: for clarity"
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Netflix for their selection and originals.Hulu for their day after it airs network TV with a no commercial option.Amazon has overlap and not a fan of their originals.
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,We do Prime and Netflix with occasional Hulu no ads. 
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"Hulu and Amazon seem to have the most overlap.  It kind of depends on how much you like Netflix.  I would go Netflix and Hulu if you like both.  If you're not in the millennial demo and feel like much of the Netflix content isn't your thing, I would go Amazon and Hulu."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"I keep all three on a regular basis and every now & then subscribe to others (binge and cancel).  Of course, you could do the same hear as well."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Netflix and Prime........because I can't get Hulu in the UK
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,"I get Prime as part of my Prime membership, and Netflix as part of my TMobile account. I only keep Hulu because my wife likes it, though since she's constantly bitching about the buffering issues, I have no idea why she likes it so much. But if $12/month keeps her happy with the TV in the house, I can live with that. The minute she no longer cares, Hulu is gone."
Pick Two: Amazon Prime Video / Hulu / Netflix,Amazon PrimeI then rotate though the services you can subscribe to via Amazon Prime (such as Acorn). Adding and deleting 3rd party services is easy.

DIRECTV NOW Adds NFL Sunday Ticket In Select Markets,I have a feeling they won't add that because RedZONE can be purchased as part of the more expensive Sunday Ticket package. Some people use the Verizon Wireless one. Sling TV does have RedZone but it doesn't really have locals now so you need an antenna.  Vue and FuboTV both have Redzone too. You don't need a PS to get Vue by the way.

However, I can say that the Amazon Fire TV 2nd generation (and the first for that matter) simply uses any HDMI cable connected from the back of the device to your TV. Yes, you will be able to set the device in the cupboard and connect any length HDMI cable that you need. I do not know if a cupboard door or even a plate of glass will stop the remote from working with the device.

Cutting the cord soon and have questions.,"I cut the cord a year ago.  Put a Fire TV on both televisions so I could get PlayStation Vue.  At that time, the Roku app didn't have a directory for PS Vue, so that made the decision easier.  I'm not sure if they fixed this yet or not.  Also, at that time, there were no local channels offered on PS Vue, so we put up an antenna and connected it to a TiVo Romeo OTA with a Mini TiVo for the second TV.  Now, most of the local channels are on PS Vue, but we still use the TiVo for most things since it's interface is so much easier to use.  Each TV is using two HDMI ports to get this going.  "
Cutting the cord soon and have questions.,"The Roku Stick+ is an excellent device and you can use the TV as the power source (assuming your TV has a USB port). This solves both your power source and exposed wiring issues. I use the Stick+ in my bedroom, which is on a separate level of my home from my router, and it works better than my still-reliable Roku 3 that's attached to the router via ethernet.I assume you can use the TV as the power source for Amazon's Fire Stick as well, but I can't vouch for Amazon's streaming devices like I can for Roku.

While I did use an Amazon Stick briefly while visiting family, I don't like being pushed toward Amazon ecosystem products when using a piece of tech. Also, Netflix crashed a few times in the one week I used the Fire Stick whereas that kind of thing never happens with my Rokus. plus the Amazon user interface isn't nearly as clean, simple and uncomplicated as Rokus.The Roku Stick+ is $70 at regular price, but has been on sale for $55 here and there (though you just missed last week's sale)."
Cutting the cord soon and have questions.,I can't get to any of the hook ups on the back of the TVs that are on the wall without taking them down so getting to the USB ports for power won't work.  I've read the same about amazon really pushing their own content and people having issues with them which made me hesitant.  
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"I have a lot of thoughts on this.  Plex is awesome because of the lifetime Plex Pass...but I feel like the offering is short since it won't do a direct pass through to the AppleTVs.  Channels decodes the signal right there on the AppleTV which is what allows it to direct tune a channel much faster.I too am in a similar situation.  Though right now I am using a TiVo for my DVR purposes, I'm testing out Plex DVR and Channels DVR.  I think the only thing keeping me back from Channels DVR full time is the commercial skip.  TiVos version is flawless...so I've been spoiled.  But itis unrealistic for a crew of 2 developers to tag every episode like TiVo does.I've also found that my guide info has been incorrect for my recordings in Plex.  I recorded Dateline for my wife to try out Plex, and none of the recordings had the proper description to them.I'm not a big fan of removing commercials like Plex DVR does.  I would much rather it tag it and let me do skipping if i want.Just a few thoughts from a long time lurker..."
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"Went from Tivo to Channels, the Commercial Skip is good enough and is right 90%+ of the time. Also since the Channels DVR commercial skip is non-destructive unlike the Plex DVR you can easily go back and see what it thought was a commercial. Until Plex's commercial skip is non-destructive I would avoid it."
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"Channels DVR ($8/mo or $80/yr, but no lifetime subscription option) offers the first month of service for free. You should sign up for it and set up the DVR and see how you like it. I did a one-month trial of the Plex DVR on my Apple TV a few months back but didn't keep it. But I know that it's gotten better since then, including adding support for live TV with a traditional grid guide. I've been using the Channels app for months now but only for live TV. I've never tried their DVR. From what I've seen, I tend to think that I'd prefer the UI and user experience of Channels DVR over Plex DVR maybe a little but I doubt I'd find it enough better to justify an extra $80/yr. Since you already have a Plex Pass, there's zero additional cost for using Plex DVR. Anyway, only you can say whether the cost is worth it. So just try Channels DVR free for a month. There's no risk. And I'm pretty sure you can continue to keep using Plex DVR and Channels DVR at the same time with the same HDHomeRun tuner, so it's not like you have to ""break"" your Plex DVR set-up. (Just don't try scheduling BOTH DVRs to record the same show at the same time.)"
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,Channels DVR is much more polished than the Plex DVR.  I use the Channels DVR on all of my Apple TVs and then point my Plex directory to my Channels DVR recording folder so they will also scan into Plex if I want to watch them remotely.  That way you have the option of watching your DVR recordings through Channels or Plex.
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,I’m also currently debating this and would love feedback. 
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"I don't have an Apple TV, but I thought there was a Plex app for Apple TV.  From what I read it has a proper grid guide as well."
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"If it doesn’t, you could always mirror from iPhone, iPad, etc."
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,But missing recommending to shows and a full list of upcoming movies and shows... 
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,I’ve used both and prefer the Channels DVR as opposed to Plex DVR simply because the UX is more polished in my opinion and much quicker to load the streams. Plex DVR has an option to transcode if your tuner doesn’t support it on the device itself but that taxes the Plex server CPU cycles.I was using Channels only for live tv but after SiliconDust announced the availability of their Premium TV offering I signed up for DVR. Currently have both Plex and Channels configured with SiliconDust Premium TV and local channels via antenna.Tonight I’ll record same episode on each just to try it and see what the results will look like. I haven’t had time to do that test yet. (For both OTA and Premium TV channel).
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,Okay let me know 
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,Well with the plex dvr you can automatically removed commercials from the show and with plex you have the ability to watch you're shows on any device and on the road. So my vote goes towards Plex.
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,Channels DVR also removes commercials and also allows you to watch remote. 
Channels DVR vs Plex DVR - Thoughts?,"I appreciate that Channels is hyper focused on live TV and DVR. The UX performance seems to be better with Channels. They support remote DVR which Plex seems to be avoiding. Their approach to commercial skipping is better. And finally, they are a small, dedicated team that is incredibly responsive with support."

Website for deciding on streaming service for sports?,"I've had YTTV for a few months and watch a ton of sports, so if you let me know what you need access to I can tell you if YTTV has it. FWIW, I've also tried Sling, DirecTV Now and Fubo, but YTTV comfortably outpaces them overall (in my eyes).Fubo wouldn't work for you, as a college football fan, because it doesn't have the ESPNs. I believe the others mentioned (and Hulu Live and PS Vue) have pretty much the same sports content at this point, give or take a non-essential cable channel here and there (YTTV, for instance, doesn't have NFL Network). They all have free trials available, so you can just try them out simultaneously and compare. DirecTV Now is also $10/mo. for three months, a great deal that I had to cancel midway through because of streaming issues (I wasn't about to watch playoff basketball with buffering issues, so I tried YTTV and haven't looked back)."
Website for deciding on streaming service for sports?,PS Vue Core (plus redzone when it is season)  Has it all.

"Live in Massachusetts, going to be living alone soon so looking to drop TV and go internet / streaming service, looking for input.","you would have to enter your zip on the website of PS Vue and Sling to view what local channels you may receive. i'm sure you're looking for your local Fox, NBC, and CBS stations. "
"Live in Massachusetts, going to be living alone soon so looking to drop TV and go internet / streaming service, looking for input.","If you live in certain parts of Western MA and want Boston channels, I would recommend Vue over Sling TV because it includes local channels. Sling does not. Be sure to use each service's zip code tool to check local channels. Use tvfool.com to find out if locals are available by antenna.I also recommend not signing up for a live streaming service until you have moved. Some services make it difficult to request/set up a new home location."
"Live in Massachusetts, going to be living alone soon so looking to drop TV and go internet / streaming service, looking for input.",There's Fubo TV but it costs around $45 per month after the first month. 
"Live in Massachusetts, going to be living alone soon so looking to drop TV and go internet / streaming service, looking for input.",No Regional sports network with sling. One reason I dropped them.. no nesn..
"Live in Massachusetts, going to be living alone soon so looking to drop TV and go internet / streaming service, looking for input.","I'm in RI, about 50 miles south of Boston, and have YTTV. I get all my network locals, NESN, NBCSports Boston, NBCSports national, 4 ESPNs, FS 1&2, CBS Sports, and a few more more. The only Pats I can't get through YTTV is pre-season, but OTA gets that for me. No NFL, NBA, or NHL Networks yet...MLB Network is part of the package. I love the service, especially for sports. If you DVR a game, it automatically extends the recording time if the game goes into overtime/extra innings."
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,"Viasat user here.  The initial ping delay causes everything to hang up for a couple seconds, and any kind of online gaming is out of the question,  but it allows us to stream Netflix and surf at the same time."
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,Thanks for your input. I don't play games often anymore but I still would hate to have that long ping. Thanks
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,4mbps is barely enough for a single HD stream but I would probably go with DSL and see if you can get two lines and a dual wan router.  
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,Yes I figured that unfortunately. Can I ask you to elaborate - what do you mean by two lines and the dual wan router? 
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,Look up Calyx Institute if you have good Sprint coverage in your area. Also look up NetBuddy if you have good AT&T signal. 
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,Thanks! I know the area gets terrific Verizon 4G LTE but of course the house is a small dead spot for that. I would have to see if I could look online for Sprint or AT&T. Thanks again
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,"You might be onto something, I really appreciate your input. I think the NetBuddy service for just 60 bucks a month would be perfect for us. The only question is whether the house gets LTE... I checked a coverage map and it says it does. However, we have Verizon cell phones and their coverage map also says it gets LTE but it does not. I wonder how I could test it for myself. Debating buying a cheap tracfone to test... any suggestions? "
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,"DSL speed drops the further away from the office you are failing after 18,000 ft. without a repeater.  Having moved to the dream house in a rural location, Directv dvr and over the air antenna have been the source of entertainment with internet via cellular modem for very light usage.  Too far from the CO to get DSL, we finally received cable internet after 10 years by suing the township to enforce the bylaws requiring the cable franchise to connect us to the cable that was dangling off telephone pole at the end of the driveway."
Viasat Satellite vs Windstream DSL,">Update: I checked an address 0.5 miles down the road in Windstream's system and that address can get 12 mbps for the same price. Why would it only show 4 mbps for me? With DSL, a lot depends on how close you are to the phone company's nearest switch and how good the wiring between you and them is. "
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,Do you have an old satellite dish on your roof?  You can take the dish off and use the roof mount for an antenna then just use the same coax that was going to the dish.
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,Yeah I do but I have no idea where the coax cable is for that 
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"Tried a Oneby1 indoor antenna a while ago and we only got a few channels. It would be best to get a rooftop antenna, but I'm not very handy and don't want to spend the money having it professionally installed. Are there any indoor antennas that would work in my situation?"

What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"With that spread, I'd go with an outside antenna. The money used to set it up may be worth it in the long run. See if they can also make it adjustable (able to rotate to another direction) in case you want to change things up."
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,Looks like you need 8 antennas. Are all your major networks in one compass point at least? 
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,Your CBS is predicted to be quite weak. So a larger roof antenna could be what you want here. Ask for suggestions.
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,A big one. Up high. On your roof or a tower. That gets UHF/High VHF. Pointed southwest. 
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"You only have line of sight to two stations.  Those ones in yellow are going to need at least an attic antenna and ideally an outdoor antenna, but because they are all in different directions, that really complicates things.  Higher-gain antennas are directional, and actually receive signals off-axis worse than an omnidirectional antenna than lower gain does.  (But an omni antenna isn't going to do the trick here either.)"
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"You're going to have a difficult time pulling in stations as noted below. Put the antenna at the highest point you can and get an omnidirectional one if possible. Try an amplifier to see if that helps what signal you're going to be able to get. I would get an ugly antenna and not one of the sexy flat ones as well. You need all the help you can get.You're still going to have issues with signal dropping with 1 or 2 reflections on every channel. If it's windy or raining or snowing, you'll have dropouts, there isn't a real way around it. CBS will be particularly bad with a weak signal and two reflections."

They use high quality cables and splitters that probably already run to where you have TVs.

If you have good internet it might be easier to just get Sling or DirecTV Now and stream your locals. "
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"Yeah I'm not really in a good position. Comcast told me that a basic internet plan without cable would be $80 per month, which seems outrageously high for the speeds we get (about 15 mbps). I guess I'll have to go with YouTube TV or something that has local channels on it."
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"Well I ended up giving up on the idea of getting an antenna and just getting DirecTVNow. They ended up having all the local channels I needed anyways. They also have a dvr feature (though it doesn't have a lot of space in it), so that should work great for me. For $40 I'm getting all the channels I need plus a free roku stick.   "
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"Eastern CT huh? Big, high antenna. "
What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,"As others have mentioned, youll likely need a roof antenna and possibly multiple if you actually wanted to pull in a majority of these stations. Do you have a short list of which stations would be most important for you to get (or do you want/need a solution that provides wide channel coverage)? This would help in breaking down this profile which portrays a situation that is sub-optimal into something with a few potentially easier solutions"

What antenna should I get for this kind of reception?,Try your antenna in a different location...move it around.  Should pick up more than a few channels.Take it all tje way to the window if u can using a long cable (dollar store)No sense wasting money if you're in a dead spot.
