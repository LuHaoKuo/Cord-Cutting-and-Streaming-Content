cordcutters,"&gt; I care about consumers, not owners of movie theaters. 

Unless the theaters decided to raise prices and concessions in order to comply with Disney's lucrative demands. Movie theaters are still a big thing and people flock there by the tens of thousands to escape the harsh reality of life. I do have a right to bring that part up. Just like Comcast has no right to end NN, Disney has no right to bully movie theaters into lucrative deals, and the Disney/Fox deal would just give them more power to do so. It's a valid concern, not something that should be shrugged off clean. Comcast is rightly criticized for a lot of things, but that doesn't mean Disney should be let off the hook either.

&gt;The internet, solely entertainment or otherwise, had more of an impact than whats going on in theaters.

But we're not talking about that, we're talking about movies and TV shows in general, as well as the valid concerns for movie theater owners and the impact Disney/Fox will have on the entertainment industry. 

&gt;Show me where I said that? Oh right, you can't because I didn't. Now who's twisting words?

cordcutters,"Sitting 6 feet or so away from my 39"" TV, I can certainly tell the difference between SD and 720p, the look is very different. However, if you put some arbitrary video on, I can't honestly tell you if it's 720p or 1080p. If you give me the remote and let me select between the two, I *can* see a difference, but it's not major. It's a *little* bit of crispness, a *little* bit of focus. Based on this, if I get a video in 1080p that's nice, but if it's only available in 720p I'm not going to sweat it. Frankly I had hundreds of SD videos and spent a lot of money replacing them. 

Based on these facts, I expect if I replaced my 39"" 1080p TV with a 4K TV, I *might possibly* be able to tell the difference if I took the remote and switched back and forth between 4K and 1080p, but I rather doubt the difference will be significant enough for me to care to invest in replacing all my equipment and replacing my collection of hundreds of videos *again*. 

(And yeah, 39"" isn't that super big for a TV, and in fact I could afford a larger one, but I think it's appropriately sized for my eyesight and my room. I deliberately looked for a TV with certain features between 38"" and 42"" and that's what had the best price with my desired features. And my boyfriend thinks it's oversized as it is.) 


&gt; After a while of having 4k content be the norm, 1080p will look awful, I guarantee it.

After a while of having 4K content be the norm I'll be seriously pissed off at TV manufacturers for trying to force me into replacing everything YET AGAIN, and I'll still be watching my 1080p 3D TV and my 1080p and 720p videos, because I won't be interested in spending the money to upgrade YET AGAIN just because they, and you, think I'll like it better. I like what I have just fine and I'm not interested in starting all over *again* with my collection or spending a lot of money just because *someone who doesn't know me at all* says I'll like it better.

Think of it this way, what if some company was selling access to Netflix (minus original content) and Netflix was getting a share, but not the full amount.

There is also data to be had about who watches what and when in movie theaters, which will now be available to AMC. Also, in the slower months (sept/oct and Jan-March) AMC will still be making money off subscriptions without doing any more work. They would be open anyway and now they will have some folks subscribed but not using the service. AMC will get all that money now.

That will depend on where you are; for now, each service offers different locals in different markets. OTA antennae could possibly be a better option.

AFAIK, no one offers that unless you pay for multiple accounts. The closest is PSVue, which offers 5, if they're on the same network.

That argument doesn't make any sense, considering the internet doesn't have divisions dedicating to one thing over the other. Media conglomerates, however, do. As I repeatedly stated, the internet contain things related to school work and the like, and movie studios don't create websites or anything unrelated to entertainment like the rest of the non-entertainment people in the world, so your entire argument that the internet is 100% equal to that of Hollywood is false. Also, you can't watch movies online on a large basis like you do in movie theaters (which explains the BO higher market share). Movies in theaters have far more quality and more HD stuff than having a bootleg version online, and people rather want to see good quality.

And it would be a result of consumer choice, not corporate greed. If you love theatres, THAT should be concerning.

Of course it's sad when businesses become obsolete - think of all the owners/past employees of blockbuster. And I'm sure blockbuster had the same pressures from Disney for how long their rentals had to stay on the priority shelves or whatever.

You'd hope the business is able to provide a service people want and that's how they stay aflpat. Theatres are the only service provider of new movies.

That's not how you spell the word ""bite""   ;-)     Back to how you don't understand physics:  A coaxial cable does NOT have infinite bandwidth.   Even if you ran 10,000 cables, you would NOT have infinite bandwidth.

Basic college-level physics.

cordcutters,"The point I was trying to make was that the 22GB threshold does not nullify the term unlimited data. My original responses mention nothing about the hotspot. I was trying to defend this one ""restriction"".


The hotspot comments are up for debate. If your sole definition of a unlimited data plan is ""must include data for my laptop as well "" then you should sue ATT for their four worded plan title because no, this isn't an unlimited data plan. But if you're going off of amount and not speed then yes, it is unlimited.",1529613532
cordcutters,"Yep, totally agree.

I think I should qualify my gripe by saying that I work for a large tech company and everyone of my coworkers, even those in non-technical positions are very tech savvy. Some of them just don't consider this a priority, even tho I witness it affecting their job and frustrating them on a daily basis. But hey, to each their own. :-)

Hard to know for sure, but from the limited data available (and actually perhaps was analyst estimates) it seemed pretty clear they were not ramping up subs at nearly the rate required... even if they got the build right (which sounds like they weren't), it wasn't going to be an economic success.",1528143451
cordcutters,"I don't have a 4k TV yet so I don't know how that works but regular HD video is great. 

I agree with you about the commands. For some reason she mutes my receiver for a second or two before raising or lowering the volume and the increments are generally too small for one command to be enough. I could maybe live with the muting if I could adjust how much it raised or lowered the volume level. 

I use the wired connection and I'm impressed with the the speed of the apps that require the web. Netflix for example is outstanding with zero buffering. Using Netflix on xfinity is terrible in comparison.

The real test will be today while I'm at work. My non-techy wife is home during the day this week and if she can watch TV without calling me I'll call the cube a success. ",1529943578
cordcutters,"Your signals are coming from a bit east of due south. How does that relate to the orientation of the antenna and the location of the window? Speaking of windows, some of them have conductive films that can block TV signals. You might try opening some windows to see if that helps (remove any metallic screens.

Insure that the Tablo and any other electronic equipment is far away from the antenna.

Mileage ratings don't really mean that much, particularly when it comes to indoor reception.

* Stellar Labs 30-2426
* Solid Signal XS HDB4X AKA Digiwave ANT2086
* Channel Master CM4221HD

cordcutters,"We went with SlingTV as replacement for cable. $20 or $25, depending on channel line-up you want. Plus they have a $5/month ""Sports Extra"" package w/various networks. $20 ""orange package"" includes ESPN. ESPN2 and ESPN3. No local channels, e.g. ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, PBS (those can often be watched in HD with usually inexpensive indoor antenna). With Sling for a year, using Amazon FireSticks. No issues with pic quality or outages. 7-day free trial..

Our two SmartTVs will handle almost all of the streaming apps, but for consistency, I use the FireStick.

Was long-time Amazon Prime customer already, for the free 2-day shipping. Streamed content and music was icing on the cake (plus we have the Amazon Prime Visa, so 5&amp;#37; off on all Amazon purchases). Cut off SiriusXM once free trial with new vehicle purchase expired. Simply replaced with streamed Amazon Prime music via bluetooth to 4Runner's sound system. So there's another savings Prime provides.

Have Netflix.

Hulu on $5.99/mo promo 'til year-end. And I was surprised, once poked around, at how much decent content is on YouTube (plain ol' YT, not subscription version). documentaries etc.

There are also a lot of free apps that can be downloaded/installed free from Amazon, to the FireStick, that stream free content, e.g. Netflix wanna-be streamers,  (movies, TV shows, on-demand content).

And can access some on-demand directly from some of the networks using their apps loaded to the FireSticks.

So, we basically cut our $115/month cable cost in half (plus avoided SiriusXM subscription cost), and have a far superior viewing experience. Even though it's the least expensive, we'll probably cut HULU at year-end. No complaints, but because we only occasionally view it. So much other content to watch.

SlingTV could go good-bye too, and I wouldn't miss it. Unfortunately, wife watches several shows on Bravo.

The only caveat: if you're heavy binge watchers, or have multiple TV sets going, be prepared to play with ""video quality"" settings on the apps/providers you do stream to tweak bandwidth usage (I have couple of mine set at 720P-like quality vs full HD 1080P quality) so as to avoid data overages on internet plan that has 1TB cap. Over that incurs $10/month overage charge for every 50GB, or $29/mo more for a no-cap data plan.",1529727450

For channel surfing, I actually plug separate indoor antennas into each TV's tuner \(which I believe is what the commenter above is saying, though he/she may be splitting the signal from an external antenna\). I don't need software for channel surfing doing it this way, I just use the TV's remote. The Tablo is super easy to set up. For watching the recordings on the Tablo, I use the Tablo app on my Roku sticks or Android TV. It works well. The biggest caveat doing it this way is that Tablo only streams in regular stereo, so if you have a home theatre in one of your rooms, you'll be disappointed.

My TV has Roku built in, so that handles Netflix (although I did just put my sub on hold for the first time in their existence because I'm just not all that interested in their current offerings and wanted to save $10 a month for a while). Everything else I do on the PC or Xbox One.

With that behind them, they are more likely to be ready to take this to the next level, why else would Apple have made such a big deal about it?

I would say, it is more likely they will be enhancing their Roku solution to keep up with what they will release for ATV.

As long as cable companies cling to what worked in the past, they will continue to decline. They have to step up to remain relevant, and if they fail with their ATV initiative, they will become irrelevant in the very near future. ",1528732676

The final straw for me was when Comcast would promise a new rate + channels, then the very next month the bill was a lot higher than they said it would be. Unfortunately for them, my town also has a company that does fiber internet.

So I got 200/75mbps + amazon (which we already had) + netflix + hulu for less cost, but a much bigger selection of stuff to watch.

It helps that neither one of us watches sports, don't watch any live tv that we care about, and don't really care about any ""exclusive"" shows that can only be found on certain networks. All we want is a good/rotating selection and the ability watch it whenever.

Part of cord cutting is changing the way you watch TV. If you go into it wanting to watch exactly the same stuff as you did on cable, then you're likely going to pay the same as you did for cable, because that's how the business works. Just the major services like amazon/netflix/hulu have more stuff than I could possibly watch in my lifetime.

Each outage was fixed within a few hours, usually through a “refresh signal” being sent, which can be done via an automated phone menu. 

I have my own modem, which is no longer on Comcast’s supported device list, but it works fine. I have packages that range from 50-200mbs (been fine with 50), just going with the best package and special they have when my contract runs out. I have found the best thing to do when a contract runs out is to go into their store or use an online chat. On the phone they tend to be more pushy, although I have heard others have not had that experience. 

Depending on region, they will sometimes offer basic cable with internet for a lower price than just internet. We have done that two separate years. Never got HD or DVR with the cable and never connected the cable box. It included HBO usually too, so check for those types of deals.

However you can subscribe to a live streaming service to get those channels and some live services like Vue or Hulu Live offer login credentials for some of their channels.

Note that some cable tv channels on Roku offer some unlocked episodes even if their descriptions don't say this. Look at the second or third newest episode to  see if they have unlocked episodes -key or padlock icon means locked. (Newest are usually locked). Note that some channels are anti cordcutter so they don't offer unlocked episodes.

I find it easier to sub to Hulu - $7.99 and CBS All Access most of the time.

They didn't straight-up lie to you. If you honestly think that then you don't understand how ISP systems work. I'm not, **at all**, standing on their side in this...they're generally despicable, but when you called the person probably typed your address in and the system said ""Ready for Installation"".

Do you honestly think that Google employees were intentionally trying to get you to move to a place where they couldn't provide your service? Can you even come up with a reason why that would happen, or be logical? Do you think they're in cahoots with your landlord to get leases while they're trying to expand fiber all over the country?

It's physically impossible for a bowtie antenna to have strong gain over VHF-Hi if it also covers UHF.  This is because the optimal element length is quite different at Channel 7 than at Channel 13.  And none of them are good for UHF frequencies.   If you try to optimize it for VHF, it's no good or UHF.

""Fairness"" is, if someone pays for a tier of service, say 10mbps, they get what they paid for—24/7/365.

With Data Caps, Comcast (or any ISP) is doing nothing more than trying to shirk their ***most basic*** responsibility as a Network Operator. Building their network to handle the load of the services they've sold.

&gt; Comcast has generally stopped short of claiming that data caps are needed for congestion management, but it has argued that overage fees are necessary to pay for network upgrades.

That's ***supposed*** to be factored in to the monthly service rate charged for each tier of service. Not by preying upon those using their connection beyond some completely arbitrary, made-up, artificial ""limit"".

Just how profitable is Comcast's Internet biz? Where is that money going if it's ***not*** going for network upgrades?

It is not, as of today. So... we're instantly back to regulation. Perhaps we could relax those regulations in the future - as you are fond of pointing out. But we don't have competition. We just get screwed until we do?

&gt;We need competition as step one.

But your first step is a HUGE one. I keep pointing out that competition doesn't happen overnight, and that there's very little incentive for companies to engage in it. I also keep asking how you think the government is responsible for competition, but you've ignored that idea.

Free OTA tv and unlimited home storage. No fees, no hidden anything. I spent about $300 to set it up and that's it. No most costs. I get all local channels free and recording and easy viewing options. Then you can subscribe to Netflix or Amazon prime or whatever if you want but it's up to you. It works amazing and our family has plenty of options for tv and I pay only for internet. I'm excluding the cost of Prime bc I have that for shipping products so I can't add that as a cost of tv. It pays for itself and more every year.  ",1529251062
cordcutters,"So long as I don't have to see advertising, I'll pay the higher price. Way back in the begin old days TV cable was all about being commercial free. I guess back then cable didn't support local TV stations either, so people would switch inputs for local shows. That being said, I'd pay my local TV station to provide be advertising free content... I honestly don't understand why this easy concept has not caught on. 

I guess to some lesser extent, at least for me, the crazy pricing of cable companies has to be mentioned... they now force cable boxes again, which are leased. We used to have cable-card things to decipher the signal. 

With online streaming, I'd rather have DRM protecting the signal compared to an encrypted cable box. Very similar things, but one sucks much less than the other.",1530296674

From here you two upgrade options (each at $15/mo or $20/mo for both) - one option allows to skip commercials and 200hrs of DVR, the other allows unlimited streams at home (without this its only 2 streams at a time) and streaming 3 devices when not at home.

Alternately, some people have had success getting through to a provider using their Twitter or Facebook account.  And in some states, your state's Public Utilities Commission or Public Service Commission, or whatever state agency regulates utilities, can often be of help.

Another method it to visit the nearest local office in person, or if you see a cable company worker doing installs or repairs, stop and explain your situation to them and ask who you can call to get past the uninformed people in their call center.  If the employee gets a bonus for new customers they bring in, they may even come and do the install the same day; you never know until you ask.

If all else fails, contact the consumer reporter at a nearby local TV station; some of them love stories like this.  You may need to appear on camera but I think they would love it if you could point at the neighbor's internet connection and the ask why you can't get service.

""Alexa tune to ESPN"" switches back to the Fire Cube input and plays ESPN radio.  ""Alexa, tune to USA"" goes back.  ""Alexa, tune to Showtime"" and it shows me a list of movies playing nearby.

The ISP's customers are paying for access to the Internet. There shouldn't be a view of Netflix getting a free ride, as the customer is already paying for the bandwidth being used. Charging Netflix for the bandwidth as well would be double dipping, and it gives unfair advantage to ISP owned services and content.

&gt; Has anyone had experience canceling FiOS tv off contract?

It is easy. You would need to call the 800-Verizon number, have your account number handy (you can grab it from verizon.com/fios) and then just ask for retention when the automated system comes up.

Explain to them you aren't using the TV / Phone service, and that all you want is internet. Due to the way we are utilizing the internet (I have the 940/880 Mbps plan) it came out (w/ tax) to 102.xx a month. I believe (don't quote me) 100/100 was ~80ish USD all in.

If you have a contract *and* sign back into a new two year agreement they will waive the prorated cancellation fee.

&gt; I don’t plan on leaving Verizon for internet, so should I consider a contract for just internet if it’s going to save me money (do they even offer contracts for just internet)?

Yea, this is what I would do. My other alternative is Spectrum, and my neighbor has consistent outages. I have had ONE outage in 10 years, and that was because a DSNY truck ripped my ONT / fiber run off the side of my old house :)

That being said, it is cheaper to get a contract. Depending on where you are in NYC, if your only alternative is Spectrum I would sign into one. Save you some $$$, and the headaches of shitty Spectrum.

cordcutters,"I haven't used Plex in many years, but IIRC, what you can stream via Plex is mostly reliant on the device that runs the Plex client (your TVs, boxes, mobile devices, sticks), while the device running the Plex server (your NAS) only transcodes video when the client cannot play it natively. If you serve 4k content from your existing NAS to a client device such as the Shield, that can natively play that content, Plex acts simply as a file server and it should happily comply as long as your network is up to snuff. If you stream only to Shield, your current NAS is probably fine because it won't transcode anything.

I would not expect the Shield to function as a good Plex server, only because it lacks the power to transcode multiple streams simultaneously and still function as a streaming box itself. If you wish to watch the 4k content on many different devices (some 4k capable, some not), then you should upgrade your NAS, and in that case, building one may be proper for you. Nothing beats the power of a desktop processor for serving and transcoding files.",1529333478

They don't care if you stop using for a month and come back and how much you pay is pretty easily figured out by how much you use. Most months - 9/12 - my bill is $20 and some change. This month it'll probably be $30 because I'm going to do some stuff that'll end up with me using more voice and data than usual. But I'm able to go on a data diet and have a bill as low as $12 if I wanted/needed to.

I mostly don't care about TV, but the rest of my family watches. If cable were more like Netflix, et al I would probably subscribe on and off and change bundles on the fly as TV shows someone cared about came on/off season. Or during the World Cup or Olympics.

I get it. You like competition. It improves some things. But it also fails pretty often. There is competition in the American cell-service marketplace, but features and service there routinely lag behind other developed countries. And many of the advancements made are because regulation forced the providers into better contracts with customers. 

&gt;the fact we do not have it regards to internet access is a shocking oversight.

Are you under the impression that our lack of competition is an oversight? The providers intentionally avoid eachothers territory. Why compete when you could set up regional monopolies and grow through acquisition?

4 channels of digital 480p fit inside the bandwidth space for OTA 1080p. It was lobbied because station owners and networks didn't want to be forced to upgrade infrastructure back then. When the entire market slowed down, and no one was buying SD TV's, they purposely pushed 3D shooting, camera tools, post tools and eventually TVs. No one asked for it, it was fabricated to sell shit. There was zero consumer demand. The only leftover is 3D films in theaters. Next came 2k. Mostly driven by studios, but most of them are involved in Networks.  Again, zero demand, but plenty of cameras capturing 2k and some 4k then. Now they push VR for the same reason. To sell shit to

cordcutters,"I think the free trials suggestion is the best one. If DTVN works great for me (I am quite happy with it), but you take my advice and the service sucks for you then I gave you bad advice. The same can be said about the other services. Unlike cable where there are less variables, we see a wide variety of reports from every service. 

These streaming services can depend heavily on ISP and device(s) used amongst other things. The only real way to know which one is best for your particular situation is to trial them out. This way you can find one that has the channels you want and gives you reliable service. 

What I did was get DTVN via the ATV4K deal late last year. I still had cable, so I could fall back to that if needed. I turned off my cable box and used my DTVN exclusively to see if I had a need or want to go back to cable. What I found was that even without DVR, I didn’t have a need to go back. That made the decision easier for me to drop cable soon after. While there have been a few glitches lately (mostly related to DVR) nothing has made me regret my choice. A huge factor is that I only pay ~$28 a month for my package which includes HBO and Showtime (I have ATT Unlimited). My bill from the cable co dropped from $250+ a month to $90 a month.

Vue has been the most consistent in terms of picture quality. YTTV Is a close second. Hulu is known to buffer quite often. 

The UI on each takes some getting used to, but I’d say that YTTV’s is probably the easiest. That’s not to say that Vue and Hulu are difficult but there’s a learning curve, especially with Hulu.

Price wise, they all start at ~$40. Vue has multiple packages to choose from plus add on channels including premiums and sports. YTTV only has a few add ons (Showtime, Shudder, Sundance Now and another that I can’t remember atm). Hulu has different add ons for premiums as well as added DVR space or unlimited screens. 

Vue has an unlimited DVR for 28 days. You can record up to 500 programs. YTTV has a 9 month DVR though most of the shows convert to on demand.

cordcutters,"Some general things you should always consider, when contemplating standalone Internet vs Internet bundled with old school cable TV.

1. In many cases, the price that the cable company advertises for their Internet/TV bundle is not the true price. For most people, when TV service is bundled, you will also be paying for extra fees/rentals (e.g. outlet fee, HD fee, DVR fee, broadcast channel fee, regional sports network fee, cable box rental, etc.). Because of that, in many cases, the Internet/TV bundle will end up being more expensive than standalone Internet. With standalone Internet, the advertised price should be pretty close, except for maybe some kind of tax or small extra fee.

2. Even if in a particular given month, an Internet/TV bundle would be cheaper than standalone Internet/streaming service(s), that doesn't necessarily mean that would be true for the entire year. When you get your video just from streaming services, you have the flexibility to turn your streaming service subscriptions on/off with the click of a mouse whenever you want. There might be one month where you need a subscription to a couple streaming services, but there might be several other months, where you barely need any. There are also a bunch of free streaming apps like PBS, Tubi TV, etc., and many people can also get a bunch of free over the air channels with an antenna. On the other hand, if you have an Internet/TV bundle, you're stuck paying that one big monthly price for the entire year, regardless of what content you're watching. There is the bigger up front cost for streaming video only (buying streaming boxes like an Apple TV), but if you're smart about turning your streaming subscriptions on/off as needed, the savings should eventually cover that up front cost.

3. If you just have standalone Internet, and you're fortunate enough to have at least two legit broadband Internet service providers in your region, you should be able to keep your standalone Internet cost down. If you get your house wired to support multiple providers, and you research on how to switch between them, you can constantly switch providers and always stay on their new customer standalone Internet promotional pricing. Doing this has allowed me to keep my standalone Internet price at around $30 to $40 per month in southeast PA for the last several years.",1528729495

cordcutters,"Frontier FiOS (formerly Verizon) user here.  I recently went through this exercise.  Canceling cable was the easy part.  Be sure to keep a copy of any shipping receipt for returned equipment and the names and call numbers for each conversation.  Going on 3 months now and every month they try to charge me $200 for unreturned equipment that they have received. After I canceled cable and ported my number out, my entire account, including internet, was cancelled without notice.  I had to set up a new account to get internet since my ported out phone number was attached to the old one.  They no longer offered 75/75 in my area and had to provide 100/100 for the speeds I need at home.  That required a hardware upgrade outside my house.  They charged me $75 to upgrade the equipment, $10 to deliver a router/modem which they did not deliver and are charging me an additional $10 a month for the router they didn't deliver.  I have had the $75 refunded but I am still working on getting the $10 refunded for a router that they did not provide and I know they will charge me when I cant return it.

So to answer your questions:
* As stated above keep records of your calls and returned equipment
* I didn't have many issues canceling, they were pretty understanding
* They were going to give me $65 a month for 75/75 and phone but due to billing errors I never saw that.  My understanding is that Verizon is much better about billing.
* Not sure on that one but just ask the price difference between on contract and off to see if it is worth it to you.

cordcutters,"I use the TV's built-in tuner for surfing.  

I have an 8-way distribution amplifier coming from the antenna feed (attic mount).  The TV's all have a connection from that for channel surfing.

In my lab I have two coax drops, one feeds directly into one Tablo and the other goes to a 4-way distribution amp for projects.

In our family room we have two coax drops (off that 8-way mentioned before) and one goes to the TV and one goes to the Tablo that sits there (it's networks via WiFi whereas my lab on is hard wired).

I'm a Linux guy, so I write my own stuff with regards to the Hauppauge project... but again, I did test it with Plex DVR (running on Linux), just not totally impressed with it.

More on Tablo... while you can set things to record from most Tablo apps, it's easiest from a web browser and the web browser has to be Chrome (though Safari is another one that should work).  If it's just one show, my wife can usually navigate and find the show via the Roku and setup recording, but if there's a lot, the family usually asks me to set things up (that way I can also distribute between the two Tablos).  Running more than one Tablo on a network is supported, it's just not as integrated as you'd like to see.  You can only talk to one at a time (there's a reason why people opt for the 4 tuner Tablo... and there are other reasons as well, as there is a higher quality setting on the 4-tuner that requires the extra (assume unallocated) tuners to pull it off... with that said, the 2-tuner runs a lot cooler and is more reliable).

And more... Tablo as I mentioned transcodes as it tunes TV.  You set the quality from the device and it defaults to 720p 5Mbps as its recommended setting.  And that setting is actually fine with me as many stations are 720p anyhow (for higher framerate).  Some people don't like that and opt for the higher settings for 1080 with higher bitrates, but I find that doesn't work well with Roku's on 802.11g....  others will differ on that.  Using the recommended setting also saves on disk space.  480i channels will record at 480i.  Then only thing that gets ""dumbed down"" is 1080i channels (channels that arguably are a blessing and a curse as they aren't 1080p, but 1080i and so have the usual problems with sports and such).

Also, as mentioned, Tablo doesn't handle surround sound (which hopefully isn't a total surprise given the ""network streaming"" focus).  All gets converted to 2-channel. So, if you have a huge A/V receiver, Tablo might frustrate you if surround sound is important.

Native Hauppauge and even Plex DVR (if not remote) store the native mpeg2 ATSC streams (which are quite large btw) and contain everything including surround sound.  They just don't stream well, more for devices directly connected to the TV (emphasis on ""the"").

If you're using a PC with Hauppauge and with Windows and their software, you should be able to even do a 4-way picture of 4 different channels.  Recording requires a tuner even in the Hauppauge case.  There are EPG options I believe, but there's also the short term guide data that comes with ATSC (PSIP).  I'm pretty sure the Hauppauge sw on Windows comes with something that might allow you schedule recordings based on that.  It's just very ""near term"" data and not usually as good as a dedicated EPG supplier.  Of course, in any case you can do good ole VCR like programming.

Tablo's EPG (you have to pay) has a lot of metadata.  Including info about programs that are ""live"" and season finale episodes.  Tablo has a setting to automatically extend recordings in either of those cases.  That might not see obvious, but trust me, it's awesome.

But like any recorder, there's no automatic handling of programs following that are now off their normal schedule.  Tablo does provide setting to manually extend recordings though... so with some careful planning you can get those shows after the Super Bowl.  They'll record, but because of variances, it's still a bit sloppy.  You may have to fast forward to get the ""real start"" of the recording and of course, you might record more than what you needed.  Again, hopefully all that is obvious (there's considerable missing magic to make that smarter, solutions are hard).

If you go the way of a distribution amplifier (amp to prevent signal loss on the splits), purchase 75ohm terminators for the unusued taps.

If you live in the DFW area  let me know, I can demo and help.  Tablo community is pretty large, post to their subreddit or their Internet forum and you might get someone local that can show you their setup (which may or may not be as good as mine).

Tablo has improved their time to tune new channels (that is, surfing), but it's still slow.  Here's a video showing the problem, noting it many seconds better now: https://endlessnow.com/ten/Video/tablo-channel-change-speed.mp4

The first two channel change are for channels that were previously tuned (that it they are already being watched and recorded actually for ""live"" TV shifting)... the 3rd one channel 8.1 is the one you need to see as it represents and untuned channel at the moment and you can see the delay.  Again, it's probably 5-7 seconds less now with the newer firmwares.  Going back to an already tuned channel, is near instantaneous.  (do the math, a 4-tuner Tablo recording 3 shows only has one tuner left, so all is effectively ""untuned"")

This is way we say it's not the best device for channel surfing.  I mean it works for live TV viewing, if you can handle the long delays on channel changes.  And of course, I love the fact that I can watch Live TV from my phone from anywhere (even if it does take some seconds to tune, buffer and play).",1528214249

cordcutters,"""Routers"" don't have a bandwidth of anything, at least not in the way you're using it (routers do have bandwidth limited by their internal switch and/or wifi connections, usually gigabit for wired and something less than that for wireless).  ""Gateways"" (which is apparently the common name for router+modem combos) are usually rented from cable companies, and come in an appropriate configuration for whatever service you're buying, but like cable modems tend to be available in 16x4, 24x8, and 32x8 configurations.

&gt; But for people who are trying to save money, and all they do is watch Netflix and e-mail, there would never be a reason to upgrade beyond 300 Mbps.

Comcast periodically increases speeds without increasing prices (or, I suppose they're always increasing prices, but every now and then they give you something more for that). For example, I had 200Mbps service.  Comcast updated that, and now I have 400Mbps service.  The old shitty 8x4 modem I was using (because it was the only Digital Voice-compatible non-gateway modem available) was not able to use the new speed, so I upgraded my modem (went all out and got a 32x8 DOCSIS 3.0 modem, because why not).  I was able to do that for $80-ish, and kept the rest of my network completely untouched.

That said, you're probably more likely to upgrade your router than your cable modem, as new wireless technologies come available, with higher speeds, mesh, etc.  Upgrading your cable modem at the same time is a waste of money, assuming you even can do that (gateways tend to lag behind in features on the router side).",1529263000

cordcutters,"&gt;  the previous rate was not valid.

If you read the fine print, it says intro rates are only good for 12 or 24 months.  Also a lot of these rates are established by the CHANNELS in Hollywood, not by your local cable company.  Every channel charges from 25 to 100 cents, and you pay it (in one lump sum)

Even if you end up throwing in the towel on DTVN after a few days, you’ve still netted a 4K Apple TV for nearly half price.  

Vue has decent channel lineups that touch most of the major cable networks for a reasonable price.  But their support for local broadcast stations tends to be poor.  If you want to be able to DVR shows on ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox, may have to look elsewhere.

Should an ISP be able to block access to websites that contain content the ISP doesn't like, for example, say, a website advocating a labor strike against an ISP like say, Telus?

Should mobile carriers be able to block access to any service because the mobile carrier has a competing product?  Like say, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon did with Google Wallet?

Make sure the box says it's for both UHF and VHF bands. Ignore all the other marketing hype \- an antenna is an antenna. Try to point it south towards the towers.

&gt;Use this option for consistent, quality voice transmission.

But *not* for the computer audio. At the risk of sounding like a computer-audio elitist, that seems crazy to me. These systems always tout themselves for their digital HD audio when you go all in and avoid using your phone altogether. This makes it sound like you're going to get superior audio over a cell phone. That's just not true by any stretch these days.

&gt;I cannot use desktop-based audio because my business does not supply us with headphones or mics. We have to use the phone.

cordcutters,"Options: DTVN, PSVue, PhiloTV, Hulu Live, FuboTV, YTTV, and Sling. 

For local channels, what's available depends on where you are and which service you choose; the best option is often an antenna. 

Whether it ends up costing as much as or more than what you're paying now depends on which options you choose and how much an internet-only plan will cost in your area. *I also don't know what you're currently paying, so I can't really comment more than that.*

Regardless of what you go with, I strongly recommend using the free trials to test the services *before* ditching your current service. You'll need internet service and a streaming device to run the services, and I recommend looking at the newest Roku Streaming Stick. 

If you go with DTVN, you might want to take advantage of the ATV promo: Pay for 3 months of DTVN upfront and get an ATV at no additional cost. You can't do both the trial and the ATV offer, so if you do the trial and later want to get the ATV promo, you'll have to create a new account. 

If you use DVR because you want to watch at a different time than the live schedule, most channels have apps where you can access the content on demand; but if you're doing DVR to skip commercials, that's different. 

For the personal content on your external drive, take a look at the Plex app.

cordcutters,"They don't need to worry about market traction. OEMs will just start putting ATSC 3.0 tuners in all their new devices and eventually a large chunk of the market will have switched on their own. It's like how USB-C is being adopted. Most people aren't going out of their way to get a device with USB-C, but most devices being released now come with USB-C. Sure there's the annoyance from the people that need an adapter to interface with older devices, but eventually it won't be an issue.

As for OTA being made irrelevant by the internet, that's unlikely. Internet video streaming will always have its limitations, and ISP speeds are still inconsistent in many places. Broadcast OTA TV, as long as you can pickup a decent signal, is inherently more reliable. 

Here's a weird analogy. Internet video streaming is like everyone ordering a pizza at the same time, there's an inherent limit to how much pizza can be made and transported so you'll inevitably run into bottlenecks and reliability issues. Meanwhile, broadcast TV is like watching a parade of pizzas going by. As long as you are in viewing distance of the parade, and there's no issues with the parade itself, anybody can watch it without bottlenecks or reliability issues.

On-demand works fine over the internet, but live TV over the internet will always have limitations.",1528061147

&gt;Once your line exceeds 22 GB during your bill cycle, most of the time you'll continue to enjoy the same great network experience.

&gt;If you've already used 22 GB on a particular line during your current billing cycle and are on a cell site that's congested at that moment, your download may be temporarily queued behind other Verizon Wireless customers. This may result in slower download speeds relative to another Verizon Wireless customer's experience on the same cell site at that moment.

The super fine print says:

&gt;	Unlimited Plans: 4G LTE only. During times of congestion, your data may be temporarily slower than other traffic (only after 22 GB/line/mo on New Unlimited Plan &amp; Beyond Unlimited).

cordcutters,"The 2V was not originally designed for VHF.  They made it somewhat VHF capable  by adding that single element across the top.  It doesn't even benefit from the reflector.   It's a very expensive antenna for what it manages to accomplish.  You are paying a lot for the pretty plastic which doesn't receive anything.  

The HD7694P has multiple elements that are designed to pickup the entire VHF-Hi range.  It's a better antenna in every important aspect.  It has far more directional gain than the 2V.

As for the DB8e, it's a gimmick.  As soon as you point those two 1/2s so they are not in the same plane, you lose almost your gain.  The manufacturer even states this in the fine print. In fact you might end up canceling out a few channels entirely.  It's not worth it especially for how much they charge for that antenna.",1530054790

1. My wife and I watch a lot of the same programming together. It's annoying to remember beforehand which one of our profiles was watching it so that the show appears on the Continue Watching list when we go looking for it, and that Netflix remembers which episode is the next one we want to watch.

2. They've moved Continue Watching and the save list around a number of times. I used to know exactly where to find them. Today, I have no idea. My strongest memory is of my save list being located at the very bottom of all the content categories, as if Netflix really, really, really didn't want me to watch the TV shows and movies I'd set aside for watching.

If I load Netflix from scratch to continue watching something, I usually use the search function to find the show because Netflix has moved things around too often. It's why I've taken to using Roku's voice search instead, to directly jump to the show and minimize my use of the Netflix menus. Until you mentioned it, I didn't even know Continue Watching had been combined with My List. Or are you talking about the Amazon app? I stream Amazon so infrequently I don't use options like that. And the Amazon app is utterly slow. I can type in the search box faster than the app can begin spitting out results based on what I'm typing as I type it.

cordcutters,"It would be easy as shit becuase you would use the exact same wires.  The only difference is a form factor.  You could make cheap adapters that convert the new cable to old ports.

Think of an rj45 connector before you crimp it.  That bit of plastic now has a port on the back for the new cable that transfers through to the normal rj45 pins instead of a hole for a raw wire.  You could take these plastic adapters and just plug them into every rj45 port on existing equipment and leave them there.  Then plug the new cable into them.  The cost of converting a device over to the new cable tip would be a few pennies per port and you can leave the adapters in the device as permanent adapters and just move cables around.  Get a new device, and you don't need the adapters.  

If you had an old cable, pull out the adapter as easy as an existing ethernet cable and plug the old cable in. Need to plug an old cable into a new device, use an adapter cable with a new male port on one side and old female port on the other, or cut the end off and put the newer tip on it with your crimper.",1528411245

cordcutters,"These arguments are misleading at a minimum, disingenuous, or perhaps you have been misinformed. 

Your argument about 2015 NN rules is misleading. The previous rules in place from 2010 etc were overturned and the courts said there had to be Title II classification if net neutrality rules were to be enforced (because ISPs don't like not being able to commit acts of ""rent-seeking behavior""). 

You don't have to believe me about pre-2015. [Here's a link to a 2014 article on NN.](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/8qfueo/one_of_the_biggest_propaganda_lies_regarding_net/?st=JIBNRV2Y&amp;sh=6997b623) 

And in 2014, Google and Verizon etc had much broader swath to do what they liked in the mobile game. It wasn't until 2015 that fixed line broadband and cell phone data were put under same rules. That's why Google didn't want to play that way. 

Did you have Amazon Prime video in 2014? Until 2015, they didn't have ability to stream over cell. Only via wifi. Net neutrality rules made services agnostic so how you connected was irrelevant. 

But if you prefer restrictions and nebulous claims of ""innovation"" that is being stifled by rules that say, ""Hey, be fair! No distorting the free marketplace of ideas and goods that is the internet by creating tolls and taxes and adding no additional value in the process!"" just so ISPs can have a seat at the table (because cord cutting isn't a direct rebuke of cable ISPs business practices)...

For clarity, once you get the Roku, you still install apps on it. In your case, you can download the Fox and FS1 apps, but you can also download the Xfinity app.

ASUS RT\-AC68U/P or AC1900 is a good series (they're all very similar with minor chipset differences), the TP\-Link Archer C7 is a good budget pick, and Smallnetbuilder likes the Netgear R7800. I wouldn't spend more than $200 on a router right now, because 802.11ax is on the way, so whatever you have is going to be old in a year or two, and the gains from going beyond AC1900 are minimal at beset.

With Trump being elected and Russia interfering with our elections and nothing being done about it (aside from still being investigated) to a time when my home state had its residents vote on something, the citizens voted how they wanted, and the state did what they wanted anyways, it just seems our government does what's in THEIR best interest and not OURS.

If the theaters accepts the Disney conditions, they're forced to run some of Disney's blockbuster movies for four weeks straight and play them four times a day (as opposed to a minimum of two weeks for a film run and play it one time a day, which most studios adhere), which means they have to raise the ticket prices and concessions on consumers in order to abide by Disney's questionable demands.

If you do get it and have it hardwired I would love to know if that helps with the FPS. But I think it’s probably just how the AirTV video is compressed/uncompressed, as there is more than enough bandwidth over my WiFi to support HD video at 60 FPS.

It does not. Mine's hardwired, my entire home network is gigabit, and it's still 30 FPS. Crossing my fingers for a software update to fix this. I tried watching baseball on Fox the other day and while the game itself wasn't unbearable in 30 FPS, I couldn't keep my eyes away from the score ticker at the bottom of the screen where the 30 FPS is very obvious. Faster paced sports would probably be unwatchable though, I may have to plug my antenna directly into my TV for any NHL on NBC games if I can't stream them in the app.

Combine this with their elimination of net neutrality rules and you begin to see the end game.  You will be ""forced"" in to only a handful of choices and small competitors will be eventually gobbled up or eliminated.

The signal is even better from up here! Pretty much the same direction and location, just up 10 or 11 more feet.

I'll run it for a few weeks and then disconnect the amp and see how it works.

Because the availability of RSNs often are a consideration for those who subscribe to live streaming  services and watch sports, I thought this issue (which apparently was missed by a lot of writers in April) is something sports fans should keep an eye on.

cordcutters,"I think in the end this will be bad for consumers. AT&amp;T/Time Warner or Comcast/NBC Universal will at some point impose anti\-competitive tolls to allow customers on their competitors internet service to access their television services. One example of this is what Comcast did a couple of  years ago when they throttled Netflix streaming to their internet customers until Netflix coughed up money because Netflix was causing congestion on Comcast network. [Netlfix pays Comcast](https://consumerist.com/2014/02/23/netflix-agrees-to-pay-comcast-to-end-slowdown/index.html)

It would not surprise me that with the death of Network Neutrality this kind of behavior will return. We have seen standoffs in the past between Cable Companies and Television companies which have resulted in loss of channels to cable subscribers.  For example CBS cannot charge Dish Network for it's local OTA channel, but it can require Dish to carry affiliate channels and charge for them. [Dish CBS Blackout](http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-cbs-dish-reach-deal-blackout-ends-20171124-story.html)

In the end the customer will pay more for the same services and the new large conglomerate Internet/TV Companies will get even bigger and expect even larger profits going forward. After all the cost of cable television over the last decade has increased at a faster pace [then inflation](http://time.com/money/4227133/cable-price-four-times-inflation/).  I also expect that this will result in a further decrease of good news coverage, and more news as entertainment. 

If you read this far here is a funny side note from my own experience. After Comcast instituted data caps I called and asked a customer service reps what was meant by Unlimited in my data plan since I was capped at 1TB. I was told that unlimited meant access to any website or service I wanted on the internet. Which I took to mean that at some point Comcast would introduced some sort of tiered service where you got really cheap internet but could only access parts of the internet that Comcast owned, or was being payed an extra toll to allow access to. I cannot remember where but there was articles floating around not that long ago about internet somewhere that was broken down by what you could access like youtube and facebook but not twitter and instagram. 

  
Which when you think about it will be the golden goose for ISP's/Cable Providers they will be able to break up the internet and offer it just like they used to offer [tv channel bundles](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/12/15953894/net-neutrality-day-action-regulations-cable-tv-fast-lanes-startups).

As far as internet speed goes, I think 100 mbps would work fine.  Even with 4 HD streams going at once you should have plenty of bandwidth to spare.  If you want to stream 4k things could get tight with multiple 4k streams.  I would say try it at the 100 mbps speeds, if it doesn't work, upgrade.

If I didn't care about live sports (at least those you couldn't get on an antenna like on ESPN and Fox Sports channels) I would have just used Hulu/Netflix and cut cable much before I did.  That's where cable companies would get you since the sports licensing agreements were HUGE.  Over six dollars of each cable bill goes to ESPN (which will probably rise).  The typical non-sports channel is 14 cents.  So any cable plans with lots of sports jump up in price.

cordcutters,"I'm not arguing that both those aren't true, but my point still stands. Steam, as a service, has decided to prioritize their service and offer amazing connections, and speed tests are setup specifically for that reason. It makes sense that both of those services let you connect at those speeds.  
  
By the average person, I mean someone who is streaming video and downloading the occasional file. You'd be extremely hard pressed to find another service, that you don't pay for, that gives you even a 100Mbps download window, and those speeds make no difference for streaming video, the reason he was asking. At those speeds unless you have many many people on your connection doing it at once, you don't need 100Mbps bandwidth.  
  
On Steam, is that a speed test of some sort or game downloads? I don't use steam, but 600Mbps on a download, at a continued rate, is amazing considering the un-compressing of the files on your system should slow it at some point! You'd need to be downloading to an SSD with a pretty fast system for that to be true, so I'd say you are probably way above the average user.  
  
For most families, 100Mbps connection is probably plenty of bandwidth. If you can get a Gigabit connection for not too much more, hey, why not, but if your're like most of us and that would cost up to hundreds more $ a month, its a waste of $, IMO.",1528652838

cordcutters,"its my experience that antennas designed for High VHF are normally lacking.. I am at a much farther distance and my signal levels are lower so I am much more sensitive to problems in the VHF range from 13 down to 2.

One thing you have to be aware of when choosing an antenna is its width of degrees that it can pick up signal. Unless you are using something like a 8 bay antenna that can have its sides adjusted you are normally limited to about 30 to 60 degrees of range... so what you do is find your compass readings and see how far out those signals are away from each other.. if your first signal is at 70 and your second signal is at 154 that is 84 degrees of span and your antenna won't be very good at picking up the stations at the outside edges

what you should do is .. since normally antenna towers are zoned by the local government to a small area in towns they are grouped together.. find the grouping that gives you the most stations that you like and point it that way..  in your case you are pointing it between 99 and 107 magnetic .. expect worse reception from the stations outside of your range.

also even if your antenna has 30 or 50 degrees of reception its always going to be best when its directly pointed at a station

so accurate pointing is very important.. also you are very close to towers in your area and that can cause problems",1528503981

cordcutters,"I'm not in the Apple ecosystem (well, I did open an iTunes account due to the AppleTV). I own 2 Apple TV devices, a 4th gen and a 4k, and they have become my preferred devices over the FireTV 4k and Roku Premiere+ that I have.

1. They support Vudu, Amazon, Movies Anywhere and iTunes..and Google Play movies and TV via YouTube. No one else allows you  access to iTunes movies, FireTV doesn't have Vudu or Google.

2. iTunes Extras for movies is a fantastic experience and they give you a lot of extras often not available on other services like Amazon or Vudu.

3. I find the picture quality of any service (DirectvNow, Netflix, Hulu, etc etc) seems to be better on Apple TV....and the reliability and performance of the apps seems to be better on the Apple TV. Example...Directv Now app on AppleTV blows away every other version of it.

4. Apple TV's app store has better quality control than Roku's channel store...the Roku Channel store is filled with a bunch of sh*t apps by companies simply trying to get you to watch ads.

5. The Apple tv 4k remote seems to handle better than the 4th gen remote...but with the Apple TV it is extremely easy to use other remotes, so you have options.


I would recommend downloading iTunes onto your Windows computer and creating an account with iTunes.,then linking it with Movies Anywhere. You will like iTunes movies.

1. [At least HBO lets you](http://help.hbonow.com/app/answers/detailHBO/a_id/249/~/amazon-prime-video-channels%3A-how-to-stream-hbo) EDIT: Showtime too
2. Doesn't look like it
3. Yes, though the free trials can probably only be used once every year or so for any one email.
4. [If you look under the 7-day free trial text it says the cost per month](https://www.amazon.com/gp/video/offers/signup/?ie=UTF8&amp;benefitID=hbo), though generally the price is the same as the stand-alone service.
5. Pros: Billing is all done through Amazon, and all the content is available through their one app. Cons: Not all services may let you use their separate apps, so you may *have* to use Amazon's app.
6. Never tried this. Judging by how HBO knows the email attached to your Amazon account, I wouldn't bet on being able to get a free trial a second time through Amazon with the same email.

Hulu also lets you subscribe to some services like HBO through them. Then there are the OTT cable providers that provide them, but those might not be worth the cost of you're still paying for TV from FiOS. Other than that, the only other kind of streaming aggregator service out there currently is [VRV](http://vrv.co), but they focus on more niche services instead of premium ones like HBO. On the flipside though, they offer a bundled subscription at $10 for all their services, which is a decent discount if you like 2-3 or more of the services.

I would recommend getting a streaming device(Fire sticks/boxes, Rokus, etc) for each TV, since if you ever do drop FiOS you'll most likely stop using your TiVos too. Best to get your family used to the new devices ahead of time. Fire TVs are ok, but they are missing out on services like YouTube and Google Play Movies. Rokus are the most service agnostic, with apps for pretty much everything but Apple's iTunes, Spotify, and Twitch.",1530045576

Then I made the greatest decision ever and switched to MintMobile. I can not recommend this company more.

I pay yearly, and yes it sucks to put down a year's worth of cell phone bill money at one time, but the savings have been incredible. My average monthly price after all taxes and fees has been $27.71 per line for 10 GBs of LTE per month, unlimited tethering, no overage for data (they slow you down or you can add $10 per GB or $20 for 3 GB for LTE, which I have never done).

They use T-Mobile's towers, I believe. Free calling to Canada and Mexico. When my wife calls Brazil, she pre-pays at 1 cent per minute.

The only drawbacks are:

1. No visual voicemail -- gotta call in, and

2. No perks of being a ""big four"" company, like Apple Watch cell service or pay by month Apple phones. You need to buy your next phone outright. I just put three months of what I was paying ATT per month into a savings account and I'm good for my next phone. Or 1-2 months plus selling my old phone.",1528565440

The different story arcs in the series really helped develop character dynamics.  We could feel the impact of past events and the way each member changed over time.  You just can't get that with movies unless you have multiple movies that are a continuation of a lengthy story (LotR trilogy, for example).

This is why they need to have a series that goes back to its roots, shows the long time fans what happened to all the old members of the crews from TNG, DS9, and VOY and that also grabs the attention of new viewers.

It really feels like the Star Trek series is unfinished.  A lot of us want to know how the Federation recovered from the Dominion war, how the crew of Voyager settled back in after being away for so long, and of course no true fan would want a miss a chance at seeing old Riker and Harry Kim performing a jazz duet together.

Most of the time I'm squarely in the ""fuck Charter"" camp, but this time not so sure. NY seems to have good intentions, but ultimately Charter can only service so many new customers. And by ""new"" I mean totally unserved customers with no wire attached to the home. Then comes the under served, which is another way of saying dial-up or ADSL customers, and they have to want new service. In either case Charter cannot just demand under or unserved pitential customers become customers, or ensure cable hook-up without asking. So back to my point, it's as if NY has some kind of crystal ball predicting the future number of customers, and demands Charter to complete so many new customer connections regardless of reality. That is arbitrary, and clearly a setup for failure. So NY is just doing a money grab. Meanwhile Charter is usual business, fudging numbers, or counting unserved as under served, and this disqualified. Both parties are bad actors, but in this case NY is the worst.",1529068081
cordcutters,"There are no real legacy landline systems spanning the country any longer.  The local exchanges may start as the analog systems of the past but now they are converted to VoIP.  No phone company wants to maintain all that legacy copper wiring.

So, if it went down it was likely some more central part of the VoIP system.  I guess I'm saying that attributing it to the landline part of the phone network is inaccurate.

At home and at work I use Google voice via my asterisk pbx. My phones are IP phones that connect to the asterisk server. It provides me with multiple extensions an ivr and a multitude of other features that help with my business and home life.  I rarely use my cell phone as I don't need nor want my customers calling it at will.  With asterisk I can control the call flow, announce business hours, keep the phones from ringing after certain hours, have emails sent with the voice mail message attached, have an extensive phone book and blacklist features, etc.  These types of phone systems provide a great deal more utility than a cell phone.

Friends, family, and some others know what to choose when asterisk answers to have it ring my cell phone or ring my home.

cordcutters,"Alright, I must be doing something wrong.  I recently started using Plex instead of samba share + kodi.  I was excited to get the metadata of what's been watched, what hasn't, and where any movies/tv shows got paused and the option to pick it up where it was last left off.

But my Plex instance is terribly slow.  I'm running it as a bsd jail on FreeNAS 11U4, am not doing any transcoding, and the array is a raidz2 that has a ZIL.  It's got dual Xeon 5670's @ 2.9GHz each, and has 24 total logical cores.  I don't think the issue is a lack of resources, but surely a setting I've got wrong.

It takes like 30s to open the Judge Judy Season 22 folder w/ 200 objects.  I know that Kodi pre-scans directories but it opens these folders in literally milliseconds.  

I want to like Plex so bad, but I can't seem to get it to perform even remotely acceptably. =(",1528916751
cordcutters,"Are you using your own wifi router, or just what Spectrum gave you?  If you're using theirs, it's cheaper in the long run to buy your own and may improve your signal a bit.

The ""sparkles"" don't sound like a bandwidth-related problem.  Sounds more like a bad HDMI cable or something going on with the Roku express or TV, maybe even that specific HDMI port.  Rule out/isolate the problem by trying other devices (Amazon, PS4) on the affected TV in the same HDMI port, also try different HDMI cables with the Roku--making sure you're using an HDMI cable that doesn't typically cause sparkling--and then try that Roku on other TVs.

For the other TV(s) use Rokus on smaller TVs.  Amazon's interface is a bit too busy for a small screen, imo.  Fire Stick, Roku Express and Roku Stick are all good choices, but watch for sales on the Rokus.  The Roku sticks (new, not refurbished) are going for $40 right now.  They're mostly the same as the expresses, but the remote is radio so it doesn't matter where you point it.

cordcutters,"&gt;Do you enjoy the Abrams reboot movies?

Yes, very much so. They're undeniably extremely well-made movies. Do I like them as Trek stories? Not as much as I've liked others, but not as little as I've liked the depths the series has already plumbed. People who blame Abrams for the ""death of Star Trek"" seem to forget the atrocious Next Gen movies that killed the franchise dead before he revived it.

&gt;Low IQ

Yeah, I'm not sure you wanna use this term as a synonym for ""simple"". It's basically self-undermining.

&gt; They remind me of staged wrestling..... lots of action. Low IQ.

Fair enough, but this strikes me more as a failure of imagination on your part. I'm not saying Abrams Trek is a masterwork, but to neglect the amount of thought put into the form just because the presentation strikes you as ""plebe-y"" is mere snobbery.

I agree that the third movie is better than the first two, perhaps because they finally gained the confidence to try telling their own story, rather than fearing that anything but fan-service would lose the crowds. It's hard to blame them, though; resurrecting a dead franchise is tricky business. The people who know about it know it sucked for a long time, and the people who don't only know it as ""that thing that sucked"". Getting both groups into the theatre to take yet another chance on a franchise that happily and repeatedly served them outrageous garbage is a hard sell, and it's impressive when it can be pulled-off at all. Unpopular opinion; I don't think Disney gets the credit they deserve for pulling a similar turn-around on Star Wars after the disaster of the prequels.",1530038131

cordcutters,"My guess as to why Spotify is missing is because as apps get more complicated, they struggle on the Roku. The Roku is simple by design, and at a code level too, and this is due to BrightScript. It’s not good at general computing.

I think this is why the new Hulu app struggles on the Roku, as it is a more complicated app. There are reasons why apps like PS Vue vary greatly in the UI department when compared to other boxes that are better at general computing.

Sadly, like with gaming, many app devs will dev apps for the lowest common denominator and then port over. I think we are seeing when apps start on Roku and then get ported, they almost always are the better at working across the board, and when they don’t start on the Roku, and get ported, they struggle, like Hulu. Sony figured this out and made sure PS Vue was paired back to work well on the Roku.

The negative to this is that apps may be ‘dumbed down’ to work well across the devices. I blame BrightScript for this.

That said, Roku’s marketshare is definitely a result of an intentional lower cost of entry vs being the ‘best box’.",1527868120

Other than a few channels that replace my record show with a VOD version in less than a day, sometimes less than 12 hrs (I'm looking at you USA &amp; SyFy), it's still really good &amp; I'm not planning to switch anytime soon. 

Also grandfathered in at the $35 rate ($37 something with tax.)

Lots of sports but in my area for some reason they don't have local Fox, but have Foxnet which shows soccer a lot.  Have all the other 3 major locals... one of the other reasons I picked YouTube TV, since they had our local ABC when no other services did.

I have 1 smart TV &amp; the other 3 TVs have chromecasts. Works really well on our android devices too.  Sometimes I watch with my s7 edge in the shower.

It's like going to a pizza buffet where 90% of the time there is a short line but sometimes the line grows longer and the kitchen can't keep up fully with demand. There is limited pizza for everyone, but those who have already been up multiple times get 1 slice instead of 3 slices. Whereas earlier everyone could have stacked food on their plates higher.

There are three outcomes:


1. This was a one time outlier, and it never happens again 

2. This happens often and the infrastructure needs to be upgraded. It's updated and the problem never happens again

3. It's constantly busy and doesn't get fixed so you leave and find another company

Only downside I've found so far is that the DVR records way too much stuff! I am coming from the world of cable, where you can tell the DVR to only record showings on a certain channel or time and to skip repeats and duplicates. However, I have not found that option on YTTV anywhere. So all the ESPN shows I have added are now recording tons of airings across various channels and times, when all I care about is the new season and only need one of each episode. I know that the DVR space is unlimited so it seems unimportant but I've already found it to clutter up the screen when I am looking for the new episode to watch. ",1530035352
cordcutters,"The math works differently for everyone, based on a combination what what local options are available, and what content they are seeking to consume.

For where I am, the price difference between just a solid internet connection and internet + std TV package (locals + cable networks + espn, but no hbo/showtime/mlb/etc) is around $65+$10 in fees. I have two main viewing TVs, so that's an extra $10 to rent equipment for second. That's $85/mo... and I still don't have netflix/hbo/etc. 

With that $85, I can get YoutubeTV ($40) + Netflix ($11) + Prime ($10) + HBO ($15), which is a lot more content, and still cheaper. And all of that is month to month (well, I pay prime annually). Which means I can binge watch HBO for 2 months a year, and then cancel... and switch to Showtime.... then whereever. YTTV getting obnoxious? Punt to Vue/Hulu/Sling/whoever. Money tight this month? Cancel all of them, and check out DVDs from the local library.

That second TV? buy another Roku/whatever.. done.

Overall.... the basic premise is that instead of just taking whatever package your local cableco has decided to offer, and then lock you into a year+ agreement w/o horrible cancellation practices.... you can take control of the situation and craft a solution that fits your needs. For some people, the cable co offering is optimal. That is decreasingly the case over time, however.",1529250565

There's plenty of awesome Documentaries and Nauture shows on the big 3 streaming services. (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon). HBO is tough, you pretty much have to pay the $15/month for new stuff, but the older shows are on Amazon too.

The good thing is, you don't need to pay for them all at once!! Get Hulu for a month or two (probably in the fall when the most new seasons are on) and catch up to everything there. Then do Netflix. Then do HBO when Thrones is on.

You can get an antenna for free broadcast for local channels and news.

Play around and see what fits. The idea of having to even fast forward through DVR commercials is too much for me. I'll never pay for commercials. You'll get used to not having regular TV so fast it will shock you. You'll never run out of shows if you rotate through services.

I use an antenna, Hulu ($7.99 plan) and CBS All Access because these cover the shows I watch. I don't watch sports or live tv except local news so this works for me. Hulu covers alot of the cable shows I am interested in and sort of acts as a DVR for me. I figured this out by looking at shows I watch and my preference for watching (live, DVR, or on demand) and then I did trials. (When I cut the cord, live streaming services didn't exist) I also use NewsON, Vudu Movies On Us, and Roku Channel.

All of the services offer free trials, typically seven days but sometimes a month. Our Starter Guide discusses many of the on demand options. The Live Streaming Services Guide covers the live services. I recommend reading the guides in our sidebar and doing the free trials one at a time.

cordcutters,"Pretty soon my internet promo will be over and I'll be paying $64/month for internet. So I've been on the look out to see if any bundles make sense. Currently I spend $45/month for ps vue core. So my total internet + tv bill will be $109/month. I should stop here and mention 3 months into my contract I got an email stating I would be charged a ""non-bundle"" fee of $4/month after my promo period is over, NOW THAT'S CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! Cox sent me a promo for an upgrade of my internet to 100mbs(which I don't need, 30mbs is fast enough for me), 140 channel plan, and a telephone line that I'll never use. Sounds good right?

Turns out to get fox sports plus and the nbatv channel I'd have to pay, well I have no idea without contacting someone at Cox because their shitty web page only shows even bigger bundles. So if I did the 89.99 bundle I'd miss out on lots of sports I'm not willing to miss out on and if I want a dvr that's 19.99/month for the equipment fee on top of a 8.50 dvr fee. WTF. Oh but wait I'd have to pay a one time fee of $125 to have the pleasure of some tech connecting a cable to a box, so add another $10/month to the first year cost.  

Let us not forget Cox probably has other bullshit local channel fees, tax fees, bullshit fuck the customer fees. In the end the the $89.99 plan would cost me sans hidden fees a minimum of $128.49/month. 

I really do miss having a hardware dvr box and would gladly pay $140 per month to get the same channels/internet without hidden fees or having to cancel/negotiate after the first year. I believe $140 seems pretty reasonable. Cable company gets there cut, I get a fairly priced service everybody wins! But nope they want to fuck the customer to get that quarterly profit increase.

With ps vue I have pretty much unlimited dvr as long as I watch within 4 weeks, which often it's longer than that. I'm almost 11 months in and compared to getting dish I've saved $900 so far.

My arguemenr is that competition, consumer choice is the solution to limiting traffic. And if it is not, then we could come back to regulation. 

Today most Americans have one choice or two choices for an ISP. And where we have more than one, the second is not very competitive. 

Example: I am in my office. I have Spectrum as my ISP at 100/15. If Spectrum changes my plan I have one other recourse, go to the only other ISP here. They offer 30/2 for the price I pay for Spectrum. That's competition, but it's not a perfect solution. 

Competition, or perhaps to be more clear, comparable competition (Similar service available from multiple providers), is in my opinion the number one thing we need today. 

As I said in another post: We need competition as step one. We have it in every single successful component of the economy. Until we have it in internet we will be missing opportunities.

Yes, at the least, similar, and likely — *strictly a guess* — the identical apps, workable with any streaming device. When I view my list of ""installed apps"" on Amazon, under Digital Content|Apps &amp; More, they're all categorized as ""Mobile Apps.""

Yes. Interesting that on the drop-down list of cable services they provide as part of log-in routine, most of the time, SlingTV doesn't appear even though that particular channel/cable network is among those in my SlingTV package. Don't know if because just slow to catch-up, or if effort to ""shun"" some streaming services like Sling.

cordcutters,"I know this is not an answer to your question, but have you considered replacing/upgrading your WiFi router, to deal with the ""My wifi sucks for some reason."" issue instead.  

I would recommend an 802.11ac dual band device, that way you will have the option of using 2.4 and 5 ghz as well as the faster ac data rates.  

No need to buy the latest and greatest (read - expensive), though I would suggest that you try to get one with gigabit Ethernet since that doesn't seem to add much cost, and will allow you to actually use the full speed of the WiFi connection(s).

Adding 5ghz 802.11ac WiFi has really helped me deal with WiFi congestion, and the increased speed of the gigabit Ethernet has pretty much eliminated buffering of media on my local network, interned performance seems better, but keep in mind that this is still limited by down-load speeds.

1. Got YouTube TV.  I know a lot of ppl here have beef with YTTV but I don't mind some of the ads since it s a good pee break or getting more chips.  :). The main reason I also got YTTV is portability.  I can take it with me anywhere.

2. I am with att wireless.  I picked up a cheap K88 tablet ($60) and made it into a media device.  I stream YTTV with it (with Chromecast) and since it is an att tablet, I can take it with me wherever I go.  Since it is an Android tablet, I also installed TTV so any shows that's not offered on YTTV and can handle Plex.


Went from a $135 monthly bill to $98.  It has been 5 months and the savings already covered the cost of the tablet and the leased DVR box from Comcast and modem (got my own separate modem and router).

cordcutters,"I'm actually running Plex on a dedicated Linux VM using a 6th gen NUC as the esxi host. It's really the only VM using any real processing power, so it has most of the host resources available, and I've had no issues doing transcoding or any other intensive tasks. I was originally running it on a QNAP NAS, but that just didn't give me enough power to handle some of my transcoding requirements. Since switching to the NUC, no issues. I also just use Plex internally for me and the family, so 1, maybe 2, simultaneous streams. The media files actually sit on an NFS mounted share running on a QNAP NAS.

Regarding Tivo, I've been using them almost since they first came out, so I'm used to the interface and appreciate the familiarity of it. I've had quite a few of their devices, and they've always worked well for us. From a features and functionality standpoint, I think they are probably as good if not better than almost any other offering out there, especially with the commercial skipping, etc. When having to do so manually, I like to see where I am while FF/RWing, and HDHR+Plex doesn't offer that. While I don't plan on using it's 'suggestions' feature on OTA, since the selection is limited, it was useful when we had cable and hundreds of channels. I do like the wishlist search feature and use that often to find certain types of shows. The interface is intuitive (the new Hydra version takes a bit getting used to, but it's growing on me). What also helped make me start using it more for OTA was the fact that I already had some of the HW with lifetime service. My only real complaint is that the Roamio OTA doesn't support out of home streaming. The Bolt does I believe, as did my Roamio Plus. But in all honesty, the Tivo remote streaming has always been problematic for me. Fortunately, my HDHR+Plex setup, which I still have in place and plan on keeping, works flawlessly for that.",1527860088

cordcutters,"&gt; Republic actually means (rule of law). 

""Rule of law"" isn't necessarily an element of the meaning of ""republic,"" but ""law"" is often mentioned in it's definition, likely because there are usually laws about the choosing, function, etc of the representatives. 

&gt; The Law supercedes the majority. 

In theory, the law reflects the will of the majority, and the structure of an elected republic won't necessarily eliminate the chance of the majority creating law for self benefit. *Though the system does slow down the process and, theoretically, allows a greater opportunity for cooler heads to prevail.*

The ATSC 3.0 transition has no stations leaving UHF, and it's designed to handle signal degradation better. Pretty much the only remaining issue will be that during the transition there might still be broadcast power issues and broadcast location shuffling in order to broadcast both ATSC 1.0 and ATSC 3.0 signals at the same time. Also, the increased video quality in ATSC 3.0 is from newer video codecs and encoding methods that let you squeeze more video data in less space.

And whatever is connected to your TV should have a GPU that can handle Mpeg2 if you want to display the video as it is broadcast.   Keep in mind that on the 1080i stations, it's interlaced.  

MythTV can also seamlessly switch between antennas, automatically strip commercials from recorded shows, and work as a whole house DVR if you want to invest in the stuff to do that. ",1530045774
cordcutters,"I do not want traffic restrictions, however, I feel (sorry!) the best way to avoid them is competition. I want the ability to say go to gell Spectrum, I am going to Charter, or to Betty's Internet Service Emporium.

Again. This congress can pass a law saying no restrictions, and then they can repeal it. Or the next congress can.i point to the Seattle head count tax. It did. Not last a month before the repeal is being strongly discussed.

Laws change, a lot faster than we think. Competition (sorry again!) is more durable and offers a lot more benefits aside from fast lane protection.

So much time, effort and money... So much public awareness and the best we can hope for is your one ISP can screw you less?

I sincerely think all those resources would be better spent ensuring Spectrum cannot screw me and I am still forced to be their customer if I want to use the internet. ",1528806455
cordcutters,"Ok, I reread it and I was partially mistaken. The two important paragraphs are:

&gt;Walt Disney has agreed to a deal in principle to acquire the Sky News network from European pay TV giant Sky and boost its annual funding to about £100 million, or $130 million, for 15 years to help 21st Century Fox get final U.K. approval for its bid to take full ownership of Sky, in which it already owns 39 percent.

And:

&gt;Hancock recently cleared Fox's bid for full ownership of Sky under the condition of a sale of the news channel to Walt Disney or another party, a divestment for which full details still had to be hashed out in recent days.

Basically, the UK Gov made it a requirement that Fox had to find a new owner for Sky News, whether that be Disney or another third-party, before the UK Gov would allow Fox to bid for Sky itself. (I can't figure out why they don't want Fox itself to get Sky News though. Maybe because Fox is looking to sell itself?) Disney has basically promised that they will fund Sky News for 15 years and increase its budget, if Sky is bought by Fox.

Fox will still have to bid for Sky against Comcast before the deal is sealed. 

This is such a confusingly worded article. [This alternative one by Deadline](https://deadline.com/2018/06/21st-century-fox-disney-forced-to-increase-sky-news-budget-to-130m-per-year-to-push-through-takeover-1202413265/) is much better.",1529441585

The only reason I've ever found it useful is when I've considered switching to AT&amp;T, though I never have (for reasons besides data caps.)  In other words, at this point, its primary function is to tell which customers can safely switch to their competitor.  Even with my high usage this month I could totally switch to AT&amp;T, but the real reason I stay with Spectrum is not having to sign a contract.  AT&amp;T would save me a little bit of money, but if the service is bad then I'm stuck with them for a year or more.

Before you know it you are right back paying what you were to begin with. 

Compromise is key. Don’t expect the same experience you had with cable, stay open minded to change. Best way I found to start out is before officially cutting the cord is to set up whatever device you choose on your main tv. The tv everyone uses daily and try everything out, get everyone’s input and then once you have a decent setup, cut the cord, and implement the setup to the rest of the tv’s.

The Apple gear quit working completely long before our even older Rokus became so obsolete that they'd require rebooting every 30 minutes to play (the AppleTVs wouldn't even do that much, by then). In one case an AppleTV just plain quit working entirely, and wouldn't let us update it to try to fix the problem, or reboot it, or anything. It bricked itself.

In the other case, our last working Apple TV remote (it's so small and thin it's practically like a small scratch off lottery ticket, and so easily lost or thrown away) developed a terrible problem with its navigation ring which basically made it unusable. So we gave up.

But even when our AppleTVs worked their best, everyone here would avoid them unless all the Rokus had already been taken over. So they were the dead last choice for streaming.

If across the room is 20 ft and on a 42"" TV, then that's a given. If it's 6 to 10 ft away on a 60"", then they need better glasses.

&gt; nor could they tell 60 fps from 240.

There's zero content out there that could utilize a display capable of displaying video at 240 hz aside from a video game running on a GTX Titan or maybe a 1080ti. Certainly no movies or TV shows. In fact, 99.9% of all content is filmed at 30 (usually 29.967 in North America) fps or lower.

Even Xboxes and PS4s are capped at 60 fps. So playing those on a TV capable of displaying video at 240 hz would be pointless.

Then there's the fact that true 240 hz is practically unheard of. And if you do find a display capable of showing that, you'd never buy it because of the price. Just consider the fact that the highest true refresh rate for professional gamers is 144hz. And even those monitors are far from cheap.

The majority of TVs you can buy are limited to a true refresh rate of 60 hz and employ a variety of tricks (like black frame insertion) to artificially boost the refresh rate to ""120 hz"", but are not capable of showing 120 unique images (within one second) from the video source.

* Not only are they an ***abject failure*** as an ISP,
* They are a ***business failure.***

The ISP ***should*** be charging the calculated rate to deliver service of the aggregated total of Tiers they've sold, ***plus*** ongoing infrastructural upgrades. That's what defines a good, well-run, viable business.

If they cannot do that offering tiers at, let's say, [$80|$100|$150|$200], then 1. they are not charging the appropriate, viable rates per tier and 2. they are an abject business failure.

cordcutters,"Fellow Atlanta resident, here's my experience/insight:

- DirecTV Now, YouTube TV and Hulu w/ Live TV all have the big 4 local channels for Atlanta. Unless you're far out in the suburbs you could probably get all of your locals with an HD antenna, but I find it convenient to have them in one place with the rest of my channels. 

- DirecTV Now is probably the best fit for you because you can get both the Tennis Channel and Nickelodeon (+Nick Jr and NickToons) with their ""Just Right"" package which is $50/month. In addition to the Tennis Channel, you'll get most major sports channels like ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, SEC Network, MLB Network and regional sports channels like Fox Sports South. You will be able to log in to ESPN3 to watch events that might not be airing on a main ESPN network just like you can with cable. 

- ESPN+ will not be a replacement for regular ESPN if that's a channel you watch often. It primarily gives you access to the stuff that airs on ESPN3 but not on main ESPN channels. So you can watch an ESPN3-only event, but not what's live on ESPN. This is where having ESPN through a provider like DirecTV Now or YouTube TV is important. 

- I currently have the base DirecTV Now package that runs for $35/month. A perk to streaming TV is you can change your package at anytime, so I'm planning to move up to the package I suggested to you in the fall when football starts to get SEC Network, and then I'll cancel it after football season to save the extra $15/month. It's nice to be able to tweak your package to fit your needs during a certain period. 

- If you are an AT&amp;T Wireless customer, you can save $15/month on Directv Now with one of their unlimited wireless plans. You also get free HBO (worth $5/month). If that plan works for your family, and won't cost you more than you're currently paying, it can be a good way to save extra money on TV.

I say definitely give it a go. There are lots of great services out there, and good incentives to try them out (either free weeks or cheap intro pricing). If you end up hating it, you can always sign up for cable again...and maybe Comcast will give you a better rate to add cable back. ",1530132578

B5 came along with a show runner who had a multi season arc, 5 years of story he wanted to tell. ST DS9 started a year before B5 and many consider it to be one of the best Treks, but that's because it looked at B5's story and adapted. The writer of B5 had gone to all the studios with the story and many believe Paramount basically ripped off B5 with DS9. Anyhoo, B5 made DS9 better, and encourage Ron D Moore (the showrunner for BSG and a writer of Trek shows) to make a grand arc-based BSG later on.",1528006042
cordcutters,"TV towers are specialized (height), so they don't get moved very often. Therefore *if* your grandfather had a clear, noise free picture when you were growing up, and *if* that antenna hasn't rotted out or shifted direction over time - you should be able to receive something. And that something might be pretty decent.

This is probably that rare case where experimental efforts beat modelling. So assuming you're handy with tools, buy a balun transformer (to attach coaxial cable to your antenna) and the lowest loss US manufactured  RG-6 cable you can find. Twinlead might still outperform coax on your fringe area installation, but proper installation is a lost art - even if you could find the cable. Buy good conectors and crimping tools &amp; be sure to weatherproof with quality seals. Antenna height &amp; fresh low loss cable is likely your bottleneck - why you must be willing to put $$$ at risk. I wouldn't try it unless your grandfather had previously managed good reception.

Budget for an amplifier only if you have multiple televisions you might want to run from the same antenna. If that's the case, I'd recommend you consider one of those HDHomerun network interfaces so you display TV on any computing device in your home. Beware, HDHomerun likely needs a stronger signal than your television likely needs.

The only other option is to get one tv with a basic bare bones cable tv package with local only, get an SD box or just a cableCARD for the sole purpose of getting the bundle discount. 4K video tends to be an expensive proposition and for cordcutting you have to decide if doing so gives you more control over what you want to watch and when (and ads) than cable tv.

So since I have my comcast main coax feed in then they set me up with an amp splitter, so I have 4 coax cables split to each of my rooms now (only 3 are occupied with a tv). I might set my antenna up, follow the main comcast feed in, set up my own amp/splitter, attached the already snaked coax cables, and just plug them directly into the TVs to use there tuners. Then once that is set up, I will look deeper into Tablo. And by your info I should be able to split off another coax cable (from antenna bundle) and attach it to the tablo, while also attaching the Tablo to my router to be on my network. Then I can access my Rokus that are on my living room tv and bedroom tv. Then I'll figure out additional storage if I need it.

cordcutters,"Apple plays much nicer with others than they did in the past. If Atmos and Dolby Vision are important than the ATV is a great choice. Don’t believe the internet talking point that you have to be in the Apple ecosystem to use an ATV. I have several friends that don’t use anything Apple other than the ATV.  Roku is great for being Platform agnostic but Apple comes in a close second for the amount of mainstream apps available. You do not ever have to buy  from the iTunes movie or TV store if you do not want to. You can even move the icons to a folder and move it out if the way. The Apple TV has almost all of the streaming media apps though they are lacking a couple. FandangoNow and Philo are two that come to mind and there is also Google Play but those purchases show up in the YouTube app under Library.

You can also link your Google play account to Movies anywhere and then in turn link it to an iTunes account, Vudu, account or Prime Video account and your MA eligible movies will play just fine on the Apple TV.  As I said it is seemingly the cool thing to make fun of Apple and also to pass on the false talking point that you have to be in the Apple ecosystem. True being in the ecosystem adds extra benefits such as airplay  but not much more. I would say the Roku ultra is a great device for the price and apps, the shield is great for Atmos but is lacking in a bunch of apps that I use on a daily basis and so I relegate that to one of the guest  rooms. The ATV is great for the technology and the app performance. 

It is a hard decision picking the right device especially if you are shelling out a bit of money. Take the time to see which apps and features are most important to you since it will be your personal device.  And watch some product demos on YouTube of the different devices. Just a warning every reviewer will have their biases based on their personal needs and wants. But the videos will give you an idea of the performance. Another thing is buy from a store with a good return policy. If you don’t like whatever device you initially decide on, return it and try again. It is your money and you need to be satisfied with your purchase.  ",1528540733

For nearly a year, Sprint has offered free lines to anybody who brings their own Sprint-compatible phone.

The lines included 10 GB of hotspot, which is good for Internet on the road, and streams video at up to 1080p, so you could stream video to your home television using a USB-HDMI (on some Android phones) or Lightning-HDMI connector or by screen mirroring.  (That assumes you have decent Sprint signal at home, which is far from given.)

Earlier today, Sprint [announced a new ""Unlimited for $15 per month per line"" plan](http://newsroom.sprint.com/best-time-to-switch-to-sprint-ever-try-sprints-great-network-get-unlimited-for-15-per-month-per-line.htm), starting tomorrow, June 8.

There is speculation over in /r/Sprint that the 1 year free deal might be ending tomorrow, as both it and the new $15/month deal are online-only ""limited time"" offers.

So if you've been thinking about the Sprint free deal, today is the time to do it.

Edit:  just found an article stating at&amp;t is holding off until the time warner deal is reached. So it looks like it was bullshit. A little carrot to get a deal done, with likely nothing actually developed to get the service working.  I’m feeling a bit conned, to be honest. ",1528294358

cordcutters,"Thanks for the awesome feedback! I'll be sure to pass your list along to the powers that be.

In the meantime, I can tell you that:

- Channel tuning speed is a HUGE priority for our CEO. We've managed to whittle things down to about 6-10 seconds when you have 'Fast Live TV startup' enabled and you've got a speedy device/network. Switching back to a previously tuned channel should be almost instant. That being said, we know there's even more we can do to make this easier (like the 'last channel' button) and we're looking at the best ways to do this across platforms. 

- Sync is due to the legacy API we use to communicate with the Tablo. We are actively working to move away from this paradigm where possible to a REST-based API. Our Roku, Apple TV, and Tablo Preview app (for Fire TV &amp; Android TV) all use this new method and are sync-less. 

- The pairing requirement on Tablo Connect has been another thing we've been working on. We've done some tweaks in the last few firmware updates to make pairing more robust, but we're also looking at ways to simplify and improve this feature in other ways.

- We added a 'delete all' option a while back, but if you're looking to delete all but the most recent recordings from a series, enable the 'keep limit' feature (even if only for a minute) as it lets you delete all but the most recent recordings. 

- Temporary tuner failures are often due to poor OTA reception. We've done some significant work to recover more gracefully from these types of events, but the best way to avoid them is to beef up your antenna and/or ditch the dicey channels from your lineup. 

Anywho - beyond what I mentioned above, we have LOTS of stuff on the go right now that hopefully let you enjoy your Tablo more. 

One of my jobs is to advocate for our existing customer base when it comes to choosing what features get prioritized, so this kind of detailed feedback is super helpful. ",1529435140

cordcutters,"That's not how networking works and it is utterly and completely incomparable to oil underground and other tangible finite resources.

Bandwidth is factually *UNLIMITED* because modern networking technology can be scaled up to actually service an *UNLIMITED* number of ***nodes***. They can literally keep adding cables and switches and routers to service any conceivable number of subscribers until you actually run out of actual finite resources like space (geography), copper, silicon, aluminum, etc.

---
The Internet is an ad-hoc, Network-of-Networks and an ISP is an Access Provider whose primary responsibility is to connect ***nodes*** (paying subscribers like you and I) to those other networks. And doing so embodies operating a network.

An ISP is, at their core and by definition, a ***Network Operator***. 

The most fundamental responsibilities of all Network Operators is to manage and optimize their network to meet the aggregate and peak demands of all of the nodes on their network. Be that in your home (yes, you're a NetOp), a small/medium/large business, a university campus, a multinational corporation, a government (SIPRNet, NIPRNet, JWICS, etc) or.... an ISP.

---
Regardless whether your ISP has 1 cable or 10,000 cables running into your neighborhood, they've sold you a connection to their network at a set, limited speed. Let's say, 10mbps.

* If they cannot handle the load of your 10mbps connection to or on their network, they are an ***abject failure*** as a Network Operator (ISP).
* If they cannot handle the aggregate and peak loads of all the nodes on their network in your neighborhood, they are an ***abject failure*** as a Network Operator (ISP).
* If they once *could* handle the aggregate and peak loads of all the nodes on their network in your neighborhood, but cannot now, they are an ***abject failure*** as a Network Operator (ISP) as, 
* They have ***OVER-SOLD*** their service and
* They have ***FAILED*** to upgrade their network to meet organic demand.

ISP's create the artificial limitation of Data Caps primarily for the following reasons,

* To attempt to cause their paying subscribers to self-police their use of that which they've already paid for,
* To forestall capital expenditures on everyday, normal, necessary network upgrades,
* To enrich themselves milking a virtual Cash Cow that keeps free money rolling in.

---
ISP's, like Comcast, have generally stopped short of claiming that data caps are needed for congestion management anymore, but have switched to arguing that overage fees are necessary to pay for network upgrades.

But that's ***supposed*** to be factored in to the monthly service rate charged for each tier of service (like 10mbps). Not by preying upon those using their connection beyond some completely arbitrary, made-up, artificial ""limit"". 

Just how profitable is an ISP like Comcast's Internet biz? Where is that money going if it's ***not*** going for network upgrades?

RCA makes an ok one or you can go with channel master which is better but more expensive,1529814651
cordcutters,"Initial thoughts:

Using roku TV... guide is MUCH faster.

When I first opened the app there was more buffering than usual.  I'm wondering if it is also downloading guide data.  I'll take the trade off if that is the case.

When scrolling through the guide I hit a block of channels with no guide data.  If I tried to select one of those channels it wouldn't let me, but I was able to still scroll through them (unlike before when you had to wait for guide data to load to continue scrolling through).  This happened on first load, so it was most likely in the process of updating the guide.  It would be nice to be able to select a channel though, even if there is no guide data available.

edit:  NO issues after the first load.  I can scroll as fast as I can press up or down, and even tried to break the app by scrolling through the EPG multiple times as fast I a could.  The guide is VERY impressive.",1528194807

cordcutters,"Also a lot of Hollywood movies. No HBO, no on-demand, no DVD or VHS. 

The life of a typical well received movie was theater, then a year or so later a run on network television. If it did well it might get licensed for numerous runs. Examples would be Wizard of Oz, Sound of Music, The Ten Commandments. 

Lesser movies might end up being sold for local distribution shown after network programming ended at night or during weekend days. The emergence of independent stations provided an added market. The movie UHF is so funny to the older of us walking the earth because it is so on point. 

When HBO arrived in 1972 and home video recording in 1975 the system changed. 

Before that if you missed a movie at the theater and it wasn’t a blockbuster the networks would buy or something cheap and likely cheesy that local stations would lease, that movie was gone and you would never see it. 

If your friends came to school raving about the great movie they saw at the Rialto you likely would never see that movie because, except for rare cases, Friday was new movie night. Each movie arrived Friday and ended Thursday and that was the ONLY movie playing within 50 miles. 

Even when HBO and tape arrived they were rare. My wife and I bought our first video recorder in 1985 for $150. Had 7 day scheduling. Both in college, I made $4.10 an hour and she made $3.35 and only worked 20 hours each. It was a big deal. ",1528655100

It will be difficult for a lot of video on demand networks to comply with the law, as they have to pay attention to their customers more individually than they probably are. I don't think a ton of the vod networks that aren't the big players likely have dedicated analysts and pm's in\-house. If the city tries to go after any of them, that would be bad for consumers as content producers/aggregates are hit with an added hardship that could cause those on the fringe to fold. Now, the city doesn't have to either. If this spreads to a ton of areas with different breakdowns, it would have a bigger effect obviously. The smaller services that don't successfully utilize their data, who then improve how they collect to comply with the amusement taxes, well they'll get stronger and end up with more information on selling ad space, content shelves, what to get and produce, pretty much just a stronger data set because it'll be forced to, at some level, include location to a better extent than is currently tracked.

2) A dedicated streaming box is superior to streaming offered through a game console, disc player or smart TV. I'm assuming your Roku isn't ancient.  

Fun background: [Inside Netflix's Project Griffin](https://www.fastcompany.com/3004709/inside-netflixs-project-griffin-forgotten-history-roku-under-reed-hastings). In 2007, Netflix was about to launch a streaming box, but then spun it off into its own company -- Roku. Netflix's CEO became certain for the box to be a success, it couldn't have the conflict of interest of being owned by a streaming company (like Fire is owned by Amazon).  Roku rocks because Netflix did it right.

3) You are a first stage cordcutter. The second stage is to be happy with Netflix + one other on-demand service (Prime, CBS All Access, regular Hulu etc. -- not Hulu Live). Your tough issue is needing access to live sports, which is hard to come by without access to live cable TV. If you're lucky, CBS All Access works as it provides a live CBS feed.

The alternative is to buy an over-the-air antenna and a DVR to grab your live sports for free and record it. Or, skip the DVR and watch live sports... live.

Make sure the box says the antenna handles both VHF and UHF. Don't worry about any HD capable nonsense. Antennas are antennas.

cordcutters,"&gt;When the ISP says they can't service an address, is there anything for the consumer to do? 

Pay them to build out a connection. 

&gt; I know they are private businesses, but is there anything that can be done to help nudge the ISP towards a solution.

Ask them how much it will cost to build out a connection to your home. If they're saying you're ""too far away,"" I suspect DSL. The further away you are from the DSLAM  , the greater the attenuation (signal loss), which decreases the speeds you can have. You need two pairs to have Internet. All modern DSL ISPs are typically ADSL. They bind multiple pairs to push Internet to you. The DSLAM converts a digital signal to analogue (Fiber -&gt; digital -&gt; analogue is typically how they're fed) Considering the service sold to you is analogue via twisted pair, the speeds rapidly drop the further away you are from the DSLAM.

If the ISP is coax, you will have to pay them, unfortunately. You're only other recourse is to go with a smaller wireless ISP. However, if you're in the city centre, I don't know what your local market is like.

From the reviews it sounds like this is a 2-Tuner DVR model? If so, that means your antenna signal is being divided in two by the device which may have pushed the reception quality on those channels past what's called the 'digital cliff'. 

Does your TV offer any information on the signal quality when you do a channel scan? What about the RCA box?

Phone lines can and do provide enough electricity over just the phone line itself for a basic landline phone unit (i.e. one that doesn't come with an additional wall outlet plug for a built-in answering machine, or for wireless capabilities) to operate even when power is out. That's another reason why actual landlines are seen as superior in emergency situations. Those basic phone units don't even come with a wall plug to get their needed power, just a phone jack/line input is on the unit and that's it.

I live in Florida (hurricanes, tornadoes and electrical storms, oh my), I only have a cell phone myself.

cordcutters,"&gt;Antenna---Preamplifier---enter basement---3way splitter----coax to 2 TVs and a Tablo.

The looks OK. If you are going to have a preamp you are normally best off putting it at the antenna. Most splitters will block preamp power and you have not specified the location of the power injector so you might want to think about that.

&gt;Do I even need a preamp or do I need a distribution amp??

Sometimes distribution amps are easier to install but you would end up with a bit less performance. Normally an amplifier of any sort is not needed unless you are in a weak signal area.

The RCA ANT741 is valuable in that it has some VHF-high band performance but is not that large. If you have the room you might consider other UHF/VHF-high band antennas with more performance. Examples:

cordcutters,"I would say there are three possible options for you:

**Option 1: Youtube TV**

* Has everything you’re looking for, except for Weather Channel, as u/justathoughtfromme points out
* For a Weather Channel replacement, I would suggest using the WeatherNation app. Looks good &amp; informative
* The main issue you will have is it allows only three simultaneous streams at once. So, if you really need 6 TVs on at all times, you’ll need two accounts. That’s $80/month ($40/month x 2)

**Option 2: Playstation Vue, possibly Antenna &amp; Tablo**

* Playstation Vue has a lot of what you’re looking for, and allows up to 5 simultaneous streams
* Just like Youtube TV, there is no Weather Channel, but use WeatherNation instead
* Either the Access ($40/month) or Core ($45/month) plans should work for you
* You may not have locals with PS Vue, so you’ll need an antenna
* I would suggest using a tablo 4-tuner dvr
* While you may not use the DVR function, you can have the Tablo app on your devices to connect to the antenna, instead of wiring from a master antenna to each TV

**Option 3: DirecTV Now, possibly Antenna &amp; Tablo**

* Has pretty much all the channels you want, including Weather Channel
* Depending on your market, it may not have locals, so you could use the setup suggested in Option 2
* Allow up to 2 simultaneous streams, with a third stream added for $5 more
* So, again, you would require two accounts. If you were to get two “Live a Little” accounts, that’s $70/month

As a side note, I recently helped a small business convert over to streaming TV. We signed them up for YouTube TV and used Roku Streaming Sticks for the service. I even set up the office manager’s computer with Google Chrome so she could watch local college basketball games. The folks love it and had me set up a second location.

Timeless is dozens if not hundreds of characters traveling through time, fighting each other with multiple time machines and intricate interactions (in addition to an organization or multiple groups that don't time travel but prepared a plan that takes advantage of the people that do). Yeah the protagonist view is just a few people in one ship but both protagonist and antagonist time machines take multiple people to and fro (and they don't travel in lock step, they are free to move about unknown to the other party at least part of the time). The players in focus vary, but there are a few that are core and fewer still that are primary characters. Occasionally the extra time travelers are ""red shirts"" that just die or get ignored, sometimes one you think will ""red shirt"" turns out to be a new character to focus on even if only for a few episodes until their arc ends.

Or better yet, someone invents repeaters that can take all 50 or whatever pairs in the trunks that go between each of those on-pole couplers that are everywhere and divide up a multi-gigabit signal between them, and then each one has taps for house drops to connect to. Each one would be a little router/switch that manages traffic accordingly. They could even have add-on boards that turn them into Wi-Fi access points. And because it's still copper, they could run 48V power down the line instead of each fiber node needing a power source. Cable effectively made this investment decades ago when they changed out all their unidirectional pole amplifiers for bidirectional ones for IP service while the phone companies just sat on their asses and pocketed the government subsidies.

cordcutters,"&gt; I do not understand why cable providers have not figured out yet that millions of cord cutters would likely return if they followed suit to offer fixed rate plans, and created a hassle free system. In my opinion most of us would be willing to pay a reasonable fixed rate so long the dishonest billing practice becomes a thing of the past. Give us our internet/tv bundle for $100-150 per month and not a penny over on our bill!

I'm not sure how much I agree with this. There is a certain percentage that will likely return with a more up front and fixed billing plan. However...

Cable companies' issues are not limited to their billing. They offer a product that has largely been replaced by Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu. Look at the guide for any day outside of 7p-9p. Pick a day. I guarantee you'll see something along the lines of TBS: Family Guy, Family Guy, Family Guy, Family Guy, Family Guy. HGTV: Property Brothers, Property Brothers, Property Brothers, Property Brothers, etc. It's Netflix with the added feature of commercials. 

What about first run shows? Those are available for season pass or on any of the various vMPVD's (Sling, Vue, etc). Services where you do not need to lease a cable box.

And... because you have to lease a cable box, they can't just have people suspending service randomly, so there are contracts and/or installation fees. Also because you have cable boxes, there's a disconnect on a lot of providers on what you can watch inside/outside the house, whether or not you can watch DVR'd content, and sometimes whether you can start watching a show in the living room and finish up in the bedroom.

The cable companies know what they're doing. For people who have not cut the cord, they're trying to extort every last penny while the getting is good. For people who have cut the cord and/or moved on to Sling, DTVN, etc they know it's only a small percentage that would come back short of the deal of a lifetime.",1529534592

As I mentioned above, it was the contracts, hidden fees, unavoidable add-ons (want to watch TV in the bedroom? That'll be $5 for the receiver) and so on. If the advertised cable price was actually the price, I'd pay.

My family had multiple problems with our steaming while using the crap Comcast router.  So much so that we upgraded or speed (which, given or family size, going up to 50 Mbps was needed anyways).  Long story short, increased speed did nothing till I got a router that could handle the large amounts of devices we use.  Phones count, as do tablets, laptops, TVs, etc.

cordcutters,"&gt;	Entertainment is solely designed for people to be amused and entertained via theaters, movies, plays, and stuff, and *internet barely falls under that.*

The internet doesn't count as  entertainment because it does more than that? WTF?

The internet contains infinitely more entertainment than only movies or tv. The internet has both and far more. Just because it can also be used for other things doesn't mean it isn't also people's largest source for entertainment. The internet is a medium through which to be entertained, among many other things. I get most of my entertainment from the internet more than all the networks or movie studios combined outside of any content they put on the web. That makes it more valuable to me than if a theater is getting squeezed by Disney.

You say ""we're not talking about it"" but I am. That's been a part of my comments from the start. The same way you say you have a right to bring up your concerns about theaters getting pushed around.

And I absolutely disagree that a Disney acquisition is the ""biggest concern from... consumers"", maybe for theater owners, but if you think the internet is less important than movies, you're crazy.",1529527234

Fairpoint has now changed owners. It is now called [Consolidated Communications.](https://www.consolidated.com/residential/internet) Pricing appears to be different. They are quoting $40.99 for up to 25 Mbps down.  They also have  fiber - up to 100 Mbps down in some areas for $72.99. News articles I read last year indicated that they are rolling out fiber in more areas. Check to see if your area has similar prices. These look to be 2 year contracts. Pricing would different for shorter periods. Unless you are streaming 4K video or watching a lot of concurrent streams, 25 down is suitable. 

Since you live in area that has been serviced by Fairpoint, there is a good chance that you may be able to find either a reseller or a business class internet provider that uses the Fairpoint lines. This can be cheaper sometimes. Business class often doesn't have data caps either. 

My solution (I had a similar choice with Comcast vs DSL) was to buy my own modem, downgrade from the Performance package to Performance Starter, and stick with an antenna and on demand streaming services, and use DVDs from the library and Hoopla Digital. By dropping to Internet only I also ditched a lot of fees and taxes. For example, the HD fees, sports fees, broadcast fees. In most states, Internet is not taxed so all of those regulatory fees are gone. I have no fees or taxes. I pay $49.99 a month for Performance Starter. No, this isn't fast (15/2) but it is simple and since I don't use live streaming services or 4K video, it is [sufficient](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/internetguide) for my needs. 

I cut the cord seven years ago - long before the live streaming services so I have never attempted to re-create cable tv. Trying to exactly duplicate cable tv often means multiple packages and live streaming services and that can get expensive. I like cord cutting because I can change my services throughout the year as my needs change. For example, right now I don't have CBS All Access because their current shows aren't really airing in the summer.  Typically I have my internet, Hulu or CBS All Access. I use a Winegard Flatwave for locals, Comet, and Heroes and Icons channel.  Since I don't pay extra for no ads, both of these cost less than $8 a month. I currently have Amazon but I expect to be dropping that this month when the price increases. I occasionally try Netflix or another service. Typically, i spend less than $75 a month for everything. I use the free services in our [Starter Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/wiki/index) to fill in gaps for movies and stuff like PBS. ",1528681938

cordcutters,"Anyway, not sure if anyone actually answered your question. You can try the combiner thing. You will lose some signal due to the loss of the combiner (3 dB or half) which could be a problem for your weak signal. You probably don't have to bother with keeping the cables the same length if you have two entirely different antennas in two separate locations. Receiving back to back signals with two antennas has a reputation of being difficult so don't get your hopes up.

The Antennas Direct Clearstream 4 MAX is bidirectional, but pricey. You could probably do as well by getting a regular UHF 4 bay and removing the reflector to produce a bidirectional antenna. Examples:

* Digiwave ANT2084, ANT2085
* Stellar Labs 30-2426
* Solid Signal XS HDB4X AKA Digiwave ANT2086
* Channel Master CM4221HD
* Antennas Direct DB4e

Or you could build something like a Gray Hoverman without a reflector:

cordcutters,"I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, but, without getting into too much detail, there is an aspect of cryptocurrency called mining that rewards individuals with cryptocurrency for using their CPU resources to process transactions. In recent years, many viruses have immerged that use the resources of the devices they infect to earn these cryptocurrency rewards on behalf of the virus author. These viruses, as well as cryptocurrency mining in general, are available for all sorts of platforms with processors, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, Android, and others. There are even variants that infect web servers and use a website visitor's browser to mine the cryptocurrency. So any device that can render a website can be used to mine cryptocurrency.

It's similar to newspapers: Some are free to readers and profit from advertisers; others profit from advertisers but subsidize that with income from sales of the newspaper. In some cases, circulation and readership drastically increase when the paper is free, and they're then able to charge more for ads and profit more than they would've from per issue sales after sales began to seriously fall. 

My guess is that networks are still figuring it out, and they will gladly take as much money as they can from wherever they can get it. They'll likely continue the ""Verify to Watch"" unless they see the viewship shrink substantially.

cordcutters,"Yes, the TV app that Apple has on the Apple TV, iPhone and iPad is a glimpse into the future of how we will all access TV in the future. Content will increasingly shift away from ""traditional TV"" and over to app\-based streaming services. But having to hop in and out of separate apps, each with their own different UI and watch list, is NOT the ideal way to watch TV. (Imagine if a traditional cable DVR maintained separate lists of recordings for each individual channel and you could only look at one list at a time!) What Apple's TV app does is provide a unified watchlist of all the stuff you're currently watching (or plan to watch) across all the different apps you use. (Netflix, however, doesn't participate, so that's a major omission that will hopefully be rectified.) The TV app also lets you browse new and trending content lists with titles commingled from the different apps you use. Click on any title in the TV app and then go directly to that show/movie within the app where it resides (e.g. Hulu, Showtime, HBO, PBS, ESPN\+, Tubi, etc.). There are special sections of the TV app UI for live content such as sports and news. Eventually every streaming platform (Roku, Fire TV, Android TV) will offer a unified ""umbrella"" UI that spans all of its underlying apps. Google has already rolled out something like this in the new home screen design of Android TV 8.0. Fire TV (with their rows of app\-specific suggested content) and Roku (with their ""feed"" feature) are both edging toward it. For now, Apple's TV app is a separate app that you launch but eventually it will just become the home screen of the Apple TV, replacing the grid of apps (which will still be accessible through a sub\-menu).",1528742174

TV:  I climbed her roof and installed an antenna ($28) and ran coax to the splitter in her attic for her two TV's. 

Home phone: Ordered Ooma from Amazon ($80+ $3.50 a month for local taxes).

Internet: Got her 100MB speeds for $45/month promo.

Now her Ooma home phone runs off her internet and she only pays $50 a month max for it all. We put her on the Netflix and Plex account and watches TV with the roof antenna and YouTube, Netflix via Chromecast, and talks on the home phone all she wants. ",1528500024

The “TV” app referenced here integrates with dozens of individual network apps (ESPN, HBO, HGTV, Hulu, Amazon Prime, ABC, NBC, etc.)  With those network apps plugged-into the ATV TV app, it keeps track of shows watched / favorited.  It will list the next show to be viewed and/or prompt when a new episode is available.  Clicking on the show launches the appropriate app and begins the stream with no other navigation required.  

It supports universal search across all installed apps.  Search for “Iron Man” or “Expanse” and it will list all options for viewing each movie/episode, even if thru different networks (e.g., S1 &amp; S2 of The Expanse on Amazon, S3 on SyFy app.)  The viewing history and progress also carries over to the identical “TV” apps on iPhones and iPads.  If I watch S3E3 of The Expanse on my Apple TV, all of the devices will show S3E4 as the next to be viewed.  

It also integrates live sports and news programming from those apps, including favorited sports teams.  Set “Boston Celtics” as a favorite team and an alert will pop-up whenever they are streaming, whether on NBA app, ESPN, TNT, ABC, etc.  One button press launches the live stream.  Or to see all sports/news currently streaming across all apps, there’s one consolidated listing page within the TV app.

cordcutters,"My experience with exactly the same set of conditions (except Cox instead of Comcast):

1. There is \*no\* solution that provides the all features you're asking for: all local channels; good selection of commercial and premium cable channels; DVR with commercial skip; single user interface for all media; same user interface on all TVs.
2. Tivo will give you DVR for over\-the\-air local channels only, but will require an investment of \~$800 (for one Roamio and 2 Mini Vox), plus it requires internet over coax (difficult to set up).  Tablo will do the same for all your TVs and tablets for around $400, but it delivers picture via Wi\-Fi which is subject to noise and image break\-up.
3. The online DVR solutions offered by YouTube, HULU and Sling are not true DVRs \- they just give you access to your show via Video\-On\-Demand, and so you can't skip the commercials \- more commercials than on Cable because the give you both the cable commercials and the internet commercials
4. Most internet solutions have upcharges for some channels.  I found that to get a decent selection, I was up to $80/month with most of them.
5. None of the internet solutions have a comprehensive selection, so you might actually need 2 or 3 solutions.  For instance, YouTube doesn't have HBO or Cinemax, and so you need separate subscriptions for those.  And also, now you're dealing with multiple user interfaces and no common search.
6. As I was experimenting, I got a message from Cox that I was approaching their (newly instituted data cap), and would have to pay an extra $40/month for unlimited data.

Given all this, and the uncertainty about the impact of net neutrality, I chose to stick with cable for a while longer.",1528659188

On a standard cable in North America the frequencies from 52 to 1000 MHz are for forward path, and 5 to 42 MHz for return path (these frequencies may have changed since I learned this stuff 15 years ago, I don't work on the HFC side anymore).

So your upstream, return path has less than 5% of the available frequencies as the downstream, forward path. Of course, a lot of the forward path is taken up by traditional, linear video... but some of that has become available over the years as the cable companies decommissioned analog channels.",1528825439
cordcutters,"First , if you're sure you're going to commit to cord cutting then go ahead and buy a streaming device such as a Roku stick or a Fire stick. Roku seems to be the most dependable across various apps, although personally I like Fire Stick's sleeker interface better. But anyway, check out free trials for the various apps for live TV such as Sling, DirecTV Now, Playstation Vue, You Tube TV, Philo, and Fubo. It's a matter of getting the most channels you want in your household for the best price, so you have to weigh out and compare the various packages accordingly. 

Sling has DVR. And DTVN currently has it in beta (from what I've read only available by invitation). Not sure if the others have DVR. You'll have to read up at the streaming app websites in general anyway. 

I have Sling and we pay the $5/month for 50 hours of cloud DVR. But the on-demand feature is pretty darn good, so I mostly use that instead. I favorite shows, open them in the favorites tab, and then watch individual episodes. Much of the time I find I can fast forward through commercials even though it says that option isn't available. Sometimes I can't FF but it's not really a big deal to me. Best I can tell the commercials breaks are shorter with Sling than with cable or satellite TV, although it's the same handful of commercials which can be mildly annoying.

You'll probably want to look into installling a rooftop over-the-air (OTA) antenna as well. Btw, OTA provides the best picture available for sports since OTA uses the least compression of signal. And with some streaming services such as Sling and Philo not all of the local traditional broadcast networks are available. With Sling you can cobble the big four together with various extras and CBS All Access. But if you have an antenna you get them all for free. 

Maybe you'll get adequate reception from an indoor antenna, but if you go ahead and put one on the roof you'll get the best reception. Air TV is available with Sling which I believe does allow you to DVR channels via OTA antenna. But I would caution against buying the indoor antenna with that offer. Odds are that if your broadcast towers are more than 10 miles away you'll need a rooftop antenna anyway. Take a look at YT videos about how to remove your satellite dish and connect a rooftop antenna in its place on the dish's j mount. It's easy to do and rooftop will almost always give you better reception than an indoor antenna. I believe you can DVR OTA content using Plex and Tablo. 

As for your external hard drive library others can help you with that. From what I've read you can probably use Plex and a Tablo. But I'm not personally knowledgeable about that subject, so hopefully others will respond about that.

This test was conducted with a mediocre indoor antenna, he eventually plans to test it using his better attic mounted antenna to see if anything changes.

cordcutters,"&gt; I can't find the error in my math that makes 4K worth the extra cost but my expertise is not in gaming.

There was no discussion about cost, it was mainly about the rate of adoption. Right now 4K displays carry a mentionable premium over 1080p sets, but in a few years 1080p displays will become the new ""budget"" 720p sets that you can barely find anymore.

I have a 38"" 4K display that I use as a computer monitor, so I sit only a couple feet away. However, standing even 6"" away I can still see a massive difference between 4K and 1080p. The content being displayed makes a massive difference. The sharp and crisp text that a computer displays is absolutely the best way to compare. But if using a movie then you need to use a movie scene that contains a lot of fine detail to be able to make a good comparison.

That being said, if you have a larger 50""+ display and are sitting 10 feet away, you absolutely can see the difference. I've tested this many times with many different sets. Again, the average person that buys a 4K TV might not even realize that you need 4K content to benefit from it, and thus think that the difference isn't noticable.

You never commented about the ""240 fps"" topic.",1528082037
cordcutters,"We live on a budget here. Dropped cable TV, but kept cable internet, many MANY years ago. Originally installed Ethernet wiring to make it available throughout the house, then later added wifi too (Ethernet is still usually much faster today than wifi).

It helps tremendously to cut the cord if you're not excessively picky about what you watch. So that means anyone addicted to certain types of sports, or the latest movie blockbusters, or the latest episodes of a very small group of cable original shows (like Game of Thrones) will suffer the most either financially, or content-wise, depending upon what choices they can or must make.

Us though, we suffer from none of that pickiness. So we practically always have most or all we want to see, for minimal cost. We also get to see the stuff picky people like too; just usually a year or more later than them.

Of course, if we sometimes decide that we absolutely MUST see something of the finicky viewer's fare, that they typically must pay through the nose for, we can usually get that free too, in terms of money; it just won't be as convenient, quick, and easy as our usual choices. For anyone with an old fashioned laptop or desktop and a net connection can almost always hunt down some free version of that stuff online, and watch it there. Even Youtube itself can have such things on it, if only for a few hours before it's gone again (so you must watch it at someone else's schedule, rather than your own).

I think it's been at least a couple years since I did that, though. Since there's almost no show ever made, that's worth going to much trouble to watch. So usually here we just just sit back and watch something on our Rokus. We have a Netflix sub, but also lots of other channels (which are free) there.

We have OTA antenna TV too, with around two dozen channels.

All the major broadcasters, cable channels, and legacy premium channels are gradually making it easier and cheaper to get their stuff on devices like the Rokus too; just commercial supported, like they usually are on cable. That means you can often get them free on demand too, rather than having to TIVO/DVR them, or adjust your schedule to the stations. Example: I watched all of The Good Place and The Orville as fast as the episodes were released, on demand, for free, on my Rokus, rather than having to wait until 9 or 10 PM whatever night, to watch them on the antenna.

So anyway, the bottom line is you can get quite a lot of decent TV for a relatively low cost these days-- unless some particular show has you by the balls. I personally abhor being in such a spot as that; and so do whatever it takes to free myself of that condition whenever it seems to come up, rather than enslave myself to it.",1529774958

cordcutters,"&gt; So answer me this:
&gt; 
&gt; Why do ISPs so desperately want the laws preventing them from slowing internet down removed?



Do I have a direct answer to that ?  No .



Do I have a roundabout answer ?  Maybe .



First, the actual enactment of the FCC ""Net neutrality"" classification came about in 2015 .  It was then challenged legally by some major telecom trade groups collectively representing the industry’s biggest companies, including Verizon and Comcast, and the FCC decision was upheld on appeal in June 2016. 



So we're essentially talking of an FCC reclassification that happened 3 years ago and was legally upheld 2 years ago -- while on December 14, 2017, the FCC voted to reverse the 2015 Title II classifications of ISPs .



So in essance all the hubbub is about something that lasted (depending on your definition) 1.5-2 years , and people are treating it like the end of the world .


It was perfectly fair of you to ask me why the ISP's act now (and as I pointed out have acted in the past) to undo this classification .


But I can't help but wonder why all the drama now -- and is it (perhaps) more a part of what the political Left sees as #Resist , and what the political Right see as ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" , and less to do with actual changes on Broadband -- the same Broadband (more or less, discounting Fiber) that has been around for slightly over a decade .



Anyway , there's a ton of interesting background info on this here :




https://www.opensecrets.org/news/issues/net_neutrality/




And here you have Google arguing in 2015 against said ""Net neutrality"" , in relation to it possibly having unintended consequences:



https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/google-warns-fcc-plan-could-help-isps-charge-senders-of-web-traffic/



So as I see it -- there is no one answer , as we do not see the actual future and the results of our choices today , and based on that I refuse to panic on ""what if's"" .

cordcutters,"I look at it in two ways.  First is that you are tethered to a wire and the second is you are tethered to a radio signal.  The first can be any line be it cable or a copper wire. The second is obviously the cell network.

The cable or copper wire tether means you have a phone connected to a wire that leaves your location. That can be your fiber or your cable or your copper wiring of yore.

I have my phone system connected to cable both at work and at home.  I use my internet connection with a phone attached going through a free PBX called asterisk which connects to Google voice.  I receive and make calls.  I have a multitude of phone numbers and those ring to either all extensions that are logged in or they ring specific extensions.  In that asterisk PBX I have an IVR that picks up the call and provides a welcome greeting and then announces the caller's options.  It isn't too complex because I want to make it usable yet hard enough to at least somewhat thwart the robocalling programs.  In that I give the choice of listening to hours or directions and/or leaving messages. It knows when to ring based on work hours and Holidays.  It further has hidden options to trigger a forwarding to ring my home or cell phone.  Very few know of those hidden options.  The asterisk PBX also takes advantage of the FCC robocaller list which is automatically imported into the asterisk systems black list.  That list comprises over 45 thousand numbers.  I also have a nice phone address book and caller ID superfecta lookup.

What's my point?  I have a free landline system based off free technologies that enhances my phone use far beyond what my cell provides.  I have cell phones and have used them from  the point where they became commercially feasible.  I own several now and keep an S6 with me all the time.

cordcutters,"Abrams Trek is fine. Not to make a direct comparison, but if OST had access to the tech Abrams does in making exciting action scenes and generating a ""look"", I think they would have taken advantage, and it would have also been fine. It's not like they were *intending* for the Gorn fight's aesthetic to be ""dime-store cheap""; it's that the audience didn't mind the horrible fight choreography and Halloween-mask costumes because the story worked (as to the look/feel of Next Gen, I think the same argument applies, albeit to a lesser degree. The Tar Monster looking cheap did not add to the story of Yar's death, for example, and, in some ways, took away from it). Abrams seems to at least realize that a compelling story should be part of Trek, which is not something the makers of almost any of the Next Gen movies seemed to ever figure out. Trek was dead before Abrams came along.

I agree about the issue with the unending slog of ""grimdark"" Trek futures, though, although, ironically, that's about as '90s a feel as you can get, outside of Star Trek. That narrative tone's just wrong for the series. Roddenberry's future wasn't dark; it was hopeful, almost naively so, in some ways, arguably in reaction to a world that envisioned mostly grimdark futures (MAD tends to do that). In Roddenberry's, future, humanity had conquered illness, poverty, ignorance, war, and had set out, united and egalitarian (or as much as a middle-aged white dude in the '60s could imagine ""egalitarianism"", or as much as TV networks would show) to learn about the incredible universe we inhabit. There would be challenges, yes, but learning is always something of a challenge. That Trek has come to be defined more by the easy, stale drama of war than the more refined moral conflicts of exploration and discovery is, IMHO, the real step back, as it's exactly what Roddenberry was trying to get away from. There's a connection here to Mr. Rogers' famous testimony to the US Senate in the '70s, in which he expressed a concern about children's programming that tended to rely on simple conflicts with ""bop him on the head"" solutions. Those stories are easy to write from a perspective of generating drama, but there's often not much substance to them.",1530028644

cordcutters,"What we've learned here is that Ajit Pai is willing to grossly manipulate data to support his very pro ISP position.  What we've learned from the past is that your ISP will block/throttle sites if there is an economic advantage for them to do so.  Also remember that everything you eat/wear/watch/drive is regulated to some degree.  

So the question should be what level of regulation is best for most people.  Net Neutrality is good for service providers which is a more valuable part of the economy.  The repeal is good for your ISP which represents a smaller portion of the economy.  Further it puts your ISP's thumb on any market decision made on the service portion of the Internet.  

So far the repeal has caused at least one formerly massively competitive industry to go into massive consolidation.  The surviving service providers are now in an insurmountable position as to prevent any kind of new competition from entering into that market space for years if not decades.  

The repeal isn't going to achieve any of the goals Pai has laid out.  Its going to limit choices and damage the free market.  

In a highly competitive marketplace NN is not necessary.  The FCC is claiming that the overwhelming majority of the US has such a market.  Reality dictates otherwise, but Verizon will make an absolute killing while it gets sorted out.  Telehealth used the repeal to consolidate down to a non-competitive market, I don't see why others wouldn't either.  ",1528811516

Not a single word about ""~50%"" attenuation if you put an outdoor antenna in your attic (or living room).   You just made-up a random number based upon nothing.  In my experience as an ENGINEER you will get some decay in the signal, but it won't be as dramatic as half.  Perhaps 5-to-10%.  

- After all the signal has already passed through buildings, trees, and other stuff during its 60 mile travel to your home.... a window or roof won't make that much difference (unless they are made of reflective metal that blocks VHF/FM/UHF).  My outdoor antenna is a CM4228, but it's inside my house.  It receives stations at 60 miles distance and they are rock solid (no skipping).

You're insinuating you're an engineer. This thread proves you're not a networking engineer because you can't grasp a simple networking concept and are fixated on max bandwidth of a single point-to-point link. 

In networking, bandwidth is unlimited ***because*** you can keep aggregating those bandwidth-limited links you're so fixated upon. If you have 10 cables going to your home and run out of bandwidth, you can still add more bandwidth. By running more cables to your home. And by upgrading to a tech with a higher symbol rate, like fiber. And you can keep adding fiber and keep adding fiber and keep adding fiber, ad infinitum.

To wit, if your ISP only has 1 cable running to your neighborhood, they do not need Data Caps because bandwidth is limited because there is only 1 cable. Bandwidth is limited because your ISP is not fulfilling their most basic of responsibilities to ***run more cable*** [and|or] upgrade their network infrastructure to better technology with higher throughput.

* Antennas Direct 91XG (rumoured to have the best performance for a Yagi type)

If they re-air during the  28 days the clock starts over, if Vue drops a channel or you change your package then all of your recordings for that channel are pulled. It really isn’t a DVR but more of personalized on demand. 

YTTV keeps individual recordings for 9 months and the recordings are unlimited. If a movie/show airs again anytime during those nine months another recording is made and the time starts for that recording. You can pick which recording to view from a pull down menu. However on some channels if a Vod version is available you will be forced to watch that version instead of the recorded version. 

DTVN gives you a 20 hour DVR that deletes recordings every 30 days. You will be able to upgrade to a 100 hour/90 day DVR soon as this feature was recently announced or at listed hinted at a price point of $10.

Sling has 50 hours and can record anything but Disney owned channels and you can keep the content for as long as you wish. You can even record the movie channels which  Vue does not allow. And you can record stuff from free preview weekends which the other services do not allow. 

Hulu gives a base 50 hour DVR and will insert commercial that cannot be fast forwarded after the first 24 hours. If you watch before then you can skip through commercials without paying their $15 “enhanced” DVR fee. Which allows for fast forwarding on all channels expect FX (that I know of through dealing with support over the Americans having forced ads) and you get an extra 150 hours on top of the basic 50.

That is a basic rundown of the major services’ DVR offerings.

cordcutters,"&gt;Wrath of Khan? Nemesis? Die Hard? A New Hope?

None of these were star trek reboots so not sure what your point is.

&gt;Yeah, ""evil guy wants revenge"" is a very general trope, mostly overused, but that's hardly a criticism specific to the Reboots, nor one that's very compelling; yes, it's an overused general story framework; no, that in no way means the movie using it is necessarily bad. 

How can it not be a criticism? They literally recycled the same story 3 times in a row, despite the reboots letting them destroy whatever continuity they found inconvenient, and despite blockbuster movie budgets. And the last movie directly before the reboot was, you guessed it, *another* revenge story. The storytelling was simply lazy and they just painted over it with lots of CG and explosions. I mean, there were 6 ""classic"" films that had much less studio support and they still managed to have unique stories from each other.

&gt;It's a little telling that you're so upset about the Reboots, and yet your initial argument is this weak. Almost suggests that your concern with the Reboots isn't as rationally-based as you might think.

The first time I tried DirecTV NOW, it was terrible!  Trying it again and it is okay.  I think the interface is much more difficult to navigate then Sling.  It takes much longer to respond when navigating and searching.  Video now seems about as reliable as Sling.

cordcutters,"Actually here lurking on the sub because we're going to cut our Time Warner/Spectrum services down to cable only and am looking for negotiating tips, so here are some things you should know:

Spectrum does not allow you to see your detailed bill anymore unless you pay them $1.99 for one to be mailed (or $1.99 to drive yourself to an office for a paper copy) and the other day, when we got on a chat line with a rep who told us to create a ""My Spectrum"" account (the exact account we were using to chat with him, btw) to see the bill detail for free, he disconnected the chat as soon as we pointed it out.  IOW, you cannot see your bill in detail for free.

The reasons they don't want you to see the line items in the bill include the modem lease fee you will be paying every month ($10-$12) to rent their shitty modem.  

And we had to make multiple trips to the Spectrum store to swap out refurb after refurb until we actually got one that worked -- but it still only gave us 17-23 Mbps on the 100 Mbps plan we're paying for.

Long story short: beware of the fine print, and DO NOT use their modem, buy your own.  Even with the most expensive modem you could buy, you'll still save hundreds over the life of your account, and you'll get the bandwidth you're actually paying for.  And there are good/excellent cable modems on Amazon for under $100 (more if you want a modem/router combo).

Other than that, we haven't had problems with them: very little downtime, fairly good customer service, about what you'd expect, no horror stories.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Now with the percentage match, I wonder about if it’s a low match, does that just mean it’s a crap show or is it a good show that I just haven’t thumbs upped on the topic in the past?  I don’t want to necessarily just keep watching more of the same topics, I want to branch out and discover great shows that aren’t necessarily on topics that I’ve already seen before.

Because you asked, I've compiled a list of payments each candidate got from AT&amp;T, just as a sample.

| Board Member | Amount Received From AT&amp;T |
:--|:--
| Miguel Santiago |  $22600 |

| Devon J. Mathis | $11600 |
| Jim Patterson | $25675 |
| Sharon Quirk-Silva | $11200 |
| Freddie Rodriguez | $26867.35|

Side note: When you search, you've got to be careful. This is based off submitted data, so ""Chris Holden"" doesn't match ""Chris R Holden"" even though they're the same person. You've got to search common misspellings as well. 

Also, this doesn't account for contributions made on behalf of the candidate to another group. Like the money ATT gave to a police group at Santiago's request.

Lastly, I want to be clear. I picked on AT&amp;T because it was easy to find their contributions. Other telcos, like Charter, made contributions as well.

I played back Blu-ray file sizes (9-12gb hd) on my Celeron zbox B series before the nas. I didn't share with friends, and I only had one stream at a time to transcode - if I needed transcode.

[Hulu](https://help.hulu.com/en-us/use-hulu-live-tv-subscription-with-tve) does have the login credentials for Disney you but no Nick channels.

cordcutters,"&gt; I do not know information about the signal quality for the TV or for the RCA box. What terminology would I be looking for for that?

Every device does it a bit differently. Some show a %, some show it in DB. 

&gt; according to my TVfool report I am only picking up the closest station's channels

That lends credence to the 'digital cliff' theory. Now that TV signals are digital, they're either ON or OFF. You don't get that in between 'snowy' picture like with analog TV. If your signal drops low enough, it can drop right off the 'cliff' into not being received at all.

More on that here: https://www.tablotv.com/blog/getting-technical-over-air-tv-reception/#digitalcliff

&gt; I do not understand why the converter box would lose channels because of the 'digital cliff' 

As explained earlier, the converter box seems to have 2 tuners inside it vs. just a single tuner inside your TV. This means the signal from your antenna is being divided in two. 

Let's say your antenna is bringing in 80% of the available signal on your BEST channels. That's great for the TV. 

Plug into a device with multiple tuners and now each tuner is getting 40% signal. That's getting dicey, even for the best channels.

If you have a channel that starts out at only 60%, and split in two it's 30%... That's getting very close to not being received at all. 

Makes sense?

The best way to do both is to improve your antenna setup to better receive the channels you're getting from further away.

What I have found after getting a Samsung smart tv this Christmas is that the tv Sling app will buffer the stream which I've before had happen on the Roku app maybe twice.  The tv apps don't work as well for others too.  So maybe the problems people experience are related to which device they use to watch.  Also, Sling is perfect for the need it fills at the right price; and I'm grandfathered in for Sling Blue plus sports for $25 monthly, and 100 hrs of DVR that I still get for nothing because I was a beta user.

2017 was a breakout year for CBS All Access. We doubled our subs year over year and we kicked off our best month ever in January. We are driving this growth first and foremost with our content. This includes our big events like the NFL and the Grammys, more than 10,000 episodes of current and library programming, and our original series programming, lead by Star Trek: Discovery, which was obviously a runaway success.
...
Let’s go back to Star Trek, which was as expensive a production as we have ever done. We were just launching All Access. We got a huge amount of money from Netflix for the international rights and it made it very viable for All Access and we continue to do that.",1530024335
cordcutters,"Cordcutter, with Sling, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu, couple of laptops and iPads. Wife and I. Plan with 1TB data cap. Big streamers. Past two months, came within 50GB of cap. Won't pay Cox $10 for each 50GB over cap — or change base plan to add 500GB +$30/mo, or to no-cap unlimited +$50/mo.

So I changed provider settings to reduce bandwidth consumption, e.g. Amazon Video-Quality setting from ""Best"" to ""Better"" (lowest quality is ""Good""); Sling Connection setting changed from ""Best Quality"" to ""High Quality;"" Netflix, changed to ""Medium"" (low, medium, high). Hulu doesn't provide ability to change setting.

I'll fine tune next month, probably by moving Netflix back to High; but honestly, the changes haven't been a big deal; certainly on Sling, where we watch mostly news reporting (CNN etc). No facts to cite, but it looks like the ""medium"" settings provide 720P. Can anyone speak to this?

cordcutters,"I think its a good setup. I am also YTTV subscriber and I think its great for live TV. YTTV's DVR is great when it actually lets you view your recordings, but it sometimes temporarily replaces your DVR recording with video on-demand, which forces you to watch commercials (this usually happens for shows broadcast on the major networks).

So the only thing I would add is some sort of OTA DVR so you can avoid some of the forced VOD that might show up in your YTTV library (their word for DVR). I use a Tablo and it works great for me. It requires buying the Tablo device, an antenna and maybe a hard drive but they are a one-time upfront cost. It doesn't physically connect to your TVs, so you set it up in a room where you get the best antenna reception and it streams the data on your home wifi.  Its Android phone app is Chromecast enabled, so you can stream your recordings to where ever you have a Chromecast. Its iOS app isn't (I think), so if you're an iPhone/iPad guy you'd have to use the web interface, which is. Or buy another streaming device.

With an OTA DVR, I don't ever have to worry about not being able to forward through commercials for any show from the big OTA networks. 

There are other OTA DVR options that others may recommend, but the Tablo works well for my setup. I use a Roku instead of Chromecast, which is a little nicer since you can use a remote to forward through commercials.

cordcutters,"The cable company streaming services are oriented around the premise of providing cable subscribers access to their subscribed channels while traveling.

In reality, people want a streaming-only subscription that lets you subscribe only to the channels you want.

In practice, the cable company streaming services are used by non-subscribers who are friends or family of cable subscribers who shared their login information.

I think one cable company bucks this trend by requiring streamers to be originating from an IP address of the cable company, which makes the streaming service a dumb idea. There's little reason to provide streaming in that scenario because on-demand video can be provided through a cable box + DVR.

For cable — make a list of the programs you normally watch or record. If a lot of them are on broadcast networks \(like ABC/NBC/PBS\) put up an antenna and connect a DVR to it. Antenna channels are free and they don’t eat up any of your data cap. Save your data for stuff you can’t get over the air.

If you’re still worried about data caps, consider signing up for a cheap Netflix DVD plan. Between Netflix \(for old movies and TV shows\) and Redbox, you can catch up on a lot of TV for cheap. Also check your local public library for DVD movies.

Don’t be afraid to rotate services either. Unlike calling the cable company, it’s easy to switch between Hulu, HBO, Netflix, etc. So you can use one for a couple of months, then cancel or pause and switch to another service. ",1528088223

Plex is finally starting to roll out a grid based guide too (currently they use a weird Netflix style to show you what's on/upcoming), which will feel more familiar.

cordcutters,"The networks are all playing a game of “Chicken” with each other right now.  If consumers were able to purchase just an “NBC” streaming bundle which includes NBC, USA, SyFy, MSNBC, etc., they may gain a few subscribers.  But if EVERY network offered that, NBC would stand to lose tens-of-millions of subscribers if they’re no longer bundled with Fox, Disney, Discovery and all others.  Until now, the networks have all been able to succeed by joining arms and offering a sort of solidarity.  That’s changing a bit because some niche streaming products have appeared (Philo being one of the best examples), but even then you still have 4-5 broadcast conglomerates joining forces.  

Most people who are cutting the traditional cable/satellite cord are still jumping into multichannel streaming services.

I strongly recommend winegard flatwave or winegard freevision. You can get them from Home Depot or Amazon. Flatwave is about $40. Unlike the Mohu leaf, it is much better at VHF signals. (Flatwave is good for both UHF and VHF).  Mohu's own website documents its limitations with VHF and I don't recommend them. The also cost more. Rabbit ear antennas (with loops) are also good for both UHF and VHF signals and sometimes be easier to use when the towers are multiple directions. ",1528564379

The fact that the apps developed for tvOS tend to be much more robust and stable and feature rich, is the single most important reason one should get an ATV if they are a serious cord cutter. The whole ‘ecosystem’ talking point is thin at best.

You don’t have to be an Apple fan to use the Apple TV or at least recognize it’s the best *overall* streamer out right now. Having used all, on all the streaming services, this became very clear.

I am curious if you have you owned and used an ATV 4K, and this is informing your comments?

Apple TV has improved? Is that just in reference to YT and Amazon on the Apple TV? Aside from those, the tvOS app library has been at, or near the top for a long while now.

The Roku can’t really do the same for less money. That is the whole point. Have you used the PS Vue app anywhere else besides the Roku? This makes the point very clear, and that is just one app.

Just browse the various streaming subs, and you’ll see this reality play out. Yes, the Roku is cheaper, and you DO get what you pay for. Swift/Objective-C is hardly a painful unknown, like BrightScript is.

Netflix simply saw the writing on the wall and decided to get ahead of the curve and be ready by investing the money they would've wasted on licensing stuff that would eventually disappear, instead on content that will stick around for the foreseeable future.

Even Amazon is starting to realize this as it's trying to flesh out their original content, but they currently don't have enough to rely on yet. Hulu on the other hand is literally owned by four of the largest content distributors, so that's why they can keep a large library of current and classic shows. However that might not last, as one of its owners is looking to be bought by one of its other owners.

cordcutters,"To tell you the truth, my primary DVR of choice is Tablo.  But I build homemade DVRs and so I experiment with many different things, and the Hauppauge is usually a part of things that I build myself.  I tested Plex DVR with both Hauppauges and it worked fine, but Plex DVR isn't without problems, but it's getting better.

So.. Tablo transcodes (intrinsically) for network streaming.  Thus whatever you get from Tablo is h264 and 2-channel audio.  Plex DVR will likewise transcode for most situations as native mpeg2 ATSC just isn't all that playable over the wire... with that said, a high speed wire is recommended if you attempt it, though some would say a really good WiFi works as well.  I use Roku's as my frontends on my TVs.

Ok... this getting complicated.  Again, I use Tablo as my DVR, it stores natively h264 2-channel (the universal format if you will).  I'm the author of SurLaTablo and use that to pull media off my Tablo and put it into my Plex server for long term usage (so I don't fill up my Tablo storage).  My Plex server has 14TB attached to it currently and is easily upgraded for more (let's just say I started out with like 2TB I think).  Plex makes end device playing easier than most (transcoding as needed for compatibility to the end device).

Again, I only tested Plex DVR because I wanted to make sure it could handle two quadHD tuners, and it did.  But Tablo makes things easy and a lot more reliable right now.  And my homegrown DVR is still baking.

If something ever happened to make Tablo crapola.... I'd probably use Plex DVR (but have a feeling I'd be better off with my homegrown solution... if I ever finish it).


I actually own two 2-tuner Tablos (each uses a 1TB USB drive)... on is hard wired and the other uses WiFi.  I can't tell any difference though.

With regards to ""what I would use"" for ""player"" in the case of my homegrown solution, it might be VLC.  IMHO, they are all problematic in one way or the other.  I may fork and modify.  Maybe even a web based player (??)...

Plex DVR comes with EPG.  And yes, I think maybe Plex Pass is needed (??), don't quote me on that.  I just love Plex and so I already own a lifetime Plex Pass.  With that said, their DVR isn't fully ready IMHO.  And not sure it'll be ""ready"" to my standards anytime soon (next 2 years or so).

If you look into the Tablo route and can handle it's limitations (which make it an awesome network device), it has an EPG ($$) and I recommend a lifetime sub there as well.

And with that said (sigh...too long a reply), Tablo sucks as a channel surfing device (delays in transcoding, this affects Plex DVR as well for remote Live TV).

For those that find the internet to not be a necessity it won’t matter because if they jack up the price folks will just cancel. But far too many people rely on the internet as a means of finding work, paying bills, communication, and entertainment. Many “landline” phones are VOIP and are bundled with other internet services,  so if you cancel your internet you either pay more for phone service or pay more for the whole package. Or you get nothing at all, since there isn’t any meaningful competition keeping them honest. 

Major ISPs owe nothing to the consumer, they work for shareholders. Maximizing profits is their only goal, and they don’t care if it craters their business in the long term, because the future doesn’t exist beyond the next business quarter. 

That being said, I hope I’m wrong and that this brings out competition and lowers prices. We shall see what happens. ",1528660946
cordcutters,"Copied from u/sitefall‘s excellent comment:
In the grand scheme of things, the internet is still pretty new, and it's only in the last few years that it's reached a point where it really is a rival to ""cable television"".  I'm in my mid 30's and I can't think of a single person that I know who has cable and doesn't use it exclusively for sports, or have it as part of the internet package deal, but use the internet as a means of entertainment significantly more.


My parents, and those older than me, likely still use cable television, but students at the university I taught at, or every younger person I have dealt with while in the military or on a day to day basis, basically could care less about cable television.  Delivery platforms like netflix, and free ad based online services like youtube, twitch, and so on, absolutely dominate the market for anyone 10 to 35.


It wasn't until very recently that internet access changed from ""an additional service cable can provide"" to ""the primary service"", and each and every year cable will become even more irrelevant.  This is a big problem for cable companies, who previously enjoyed the benefits of being able to filter what is shown through their services in a way that benefits them and increases their revenue and/or political agenda.


The internet will not afford them this luxury unless they can better control it, or figure out how to earn more money from it.  How do you earn more money from what is essentially a pipe delivering information?  If you increase the price, some people will not have the service.  If you charge more or less for faster or slower delivery of water, you can ensure that you're still earning money from everyone, which is where we currently stand.


But technology is rapidly improving.  10 years ago netflix was still shipping DVDs through the mail, and here we are today where I can watch 4k HD video streaming right over the internet.  The minimum requirement of bandwidth is rapidly increasing which threatens to equalize the speed-variable pricing structure.


The natural next step is to set pricing based on content.  Facebook, Google, Amazon for $20/mo, reddit, stackoverflow, and whatever for $30/mo and so on.  This is not a prediction of a dystopian future.  It is currently happening now in several countries already, some of the poorest and least educated countries.  It's not uncommon to see cell phone services with very harsh data caps, but unlimited data for facebook and other ""approved"" apps and services.


Let's be realistic here, nobody is going to start a riot over these changes when they begin to slowly appear.  If tomorrow there was a huge change and the internet was heavily censored, people would cause a problem.  But if it's one tiny change after another that ""doesn't effect me personally"" over many many years, the next thing you know that ""one huge change"" happened, just at a different pace.


You may not notice any significant difference now, or in the immediate future, but that doesn't mean there isn't a difference.  The fact that these companies would fight tooth and nail to prevent regulation that basically ""keeps things as they are"" shows their intentions and plans for the future despite their ""promises not to do it"" or claims of ""but we haven't done it before, why would we do it now?"" (which they have done it before and can be shown by indisputable fact)


I simply cannot see how any rational, critical thinking person, regardless of political party, would be against this one.  Polls even show an overwhelming majority support net neutrality, which is really quite hopeful and shows that just because you are a republican/democrat/independent, that the other party is not entirely stocked full of morons, it's just that some, on BOTH sides of the party lines, are heavily influenceable by what can most assuredly be called government and/or corporate propaganda.


We're at some weird turning point where the older generations were, and continue to be, overtly political, and the younger generation remains less so (or at least, less active about it), and perhaps we just need to wait for a generation or two to die off before there can be any significant change in the divisionism of the country.  ""United we stand"" certainly seems more fickle than child-me would have imagined.",1528781430

cordcutters,"They still are. I watched it when it first came out. I just binge rewatched the entire series earlier this year.

Season 1 dialog is a bit goofy. Lots of awkward one on one conversations. It happens sometimes with new shows. They got way better season 2 and beyond.

What I noticed is that while watching the show, I kept thinking ""holy crap, this was written in the early 90s?"" It's amazing how forward thinking the story and relevancy were. I come from a certain political perspective that appreciated how foretelling it was. So much of the little nuanced messages on the story came to be relevant later in the 90s and 2000s and even today.

I don't care that the CGI looks outdated. I even enjoy watching older sci-fi that is way more off now. I mean, I did chuckle when I saw a CRT monitor on B5, but that's just quaint. It doesn't detract from the show for me. The other funny part is that person to person communication is less advanced than we have today. I would think as part of the security or command staff on B5 you would have mobile video chat, body cams, and location tracking within the station. But Star Trek does that too, so no big deal. It's a standard trope in sci-fi to help the story along.

This isn't a political sub, so it's better not to discuss that. But I really enjoyed re-watching it. It almost made me want to reconnect with old friends from 25 years ago or discuss conspiratorial politics with my current friends. Unfortunately, none of my current friends have seen the show or can binge watch 5 seasons and 2 movies. Too bad for them. It's truly a fantastic show.

I don't want to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it. But I will say that the ending did make me a little emotional, even though I knew what was coming. That just tells me how good the show was made. You definitely get vested in the characters watching it straight through.

The effect is called ""airplane flutter"" because that is what used to happen to the picture/sound in the analog days.

I'd much rather have a mute button on my screen that I can just click at anytime. Skype (at least the old version) even exposed the Mute call in the API, so OSX automator can access it. I mapped a mouse button to it and it changed my life.

Some apps like WebEx can natively integrate with some headsets, with no additional software. I use a Jabra 930 and when I mute in the app, my headset also mutes. If I mute the headset directly, WebEx mutes. They stay in perfect sync and I love it.

They just don't even think to open the webapp. So if my colleagues also dial in, it compounds the audio delay and overall crappy quality.

I was a customer &amp; supporter for more than a year but eventually tired of their inability to improve.  

PlayStation Vue  and YouTube TV are both better products.  More reliable, better interface, allow more concurrent streams, more flexible DVR.  Both services are missing some channels that may be of interest, but they can be paired with a separate service called Philo to fill most of the gaps.

* App has to ""sync"" with the Tablo, which can take 5+ minutes of waiting. On a mobile device, that means leaving the app open for 5+ minutes (it can't sync in the background). It frequently has to be re-synced, which is a huge bummer when you just want to watch some TV.
* Initial sync has to be done on the local network. Traveling and had to re-install the app? Can't sync until you get home. Got a FireTV in a second home? Gotta move it to do the sync. And sometimes it will forget and need to be brought back to re-sync.

cordcutters,"I have this and an HDHomerun/Plex. With Plex, I’ve struggled for a long time viewing locals outside of my house. I was hoping the AirTV would be an improvement in this specific use case. 

In fact, the new AirTV does a much better job of transmitting locals outside the house on mobile devices. The transcoding seems to work better and it tunes in every time. Plex has always been 50/50 on tuning in channels outside of home, at least for me. 

The AirTV apps are pretty rough at the moment and very beta-ish. There is plenty of room for improvement. At home, i still prefer the ATV Channels app. The guide is much like the SlingTV app, not a fan. 

If you are looking specifically for accessing your locals outside of home, i would recommend the AirTV.

We have other stuff that we share with our family so we have even more now.

No hidden fee's.  There are no leasing fee's and no dumb ass cable tv taxes like Entertainment tax, Sports tax, Comcast hates you Tax... just an Internet tax which is very low.  As an example, we were on RCN Lehigh Valley and we had $32 dollars in taxes/fees for our cable + $24 lease for 2 Tivo's and now we have like $5 internet tax and that's it.  As I said earlier, we did 2 Roku (little mini boxes that plug into HDMI) for the living room and bedroom.  Depending on what you pick, you usually get big packages of TV shows and we are very new to it but like I said between Youtube TV and Philo, it covered everything for us that we used to watch and even got channels which were speciality channels on our old cable setup.

But if your internet is *mostly* dependable and this was an anomaly, then IMHO, I would've much rather have be dropped from the call altogether, then to lose my audio controls without knowing it. At least then, everyone would've known you'd been dropped and just waited for you to come back. Most people are forgiving of that. And you could've immediately mitigated by dialing in. The phone is always a good backup.

I know that sounds counterintuitive. But internet blips aren't uncommon and they happen to everyone. On the whole, assuming the choices are between phone (99.99% call uptime + 5/10 quality) and computer audio (~95% uptime + 9/10 quality), I'm going with the computer. But that's me, I'm on calls all day. In the long run, call fidelity far outweighs the minor inconvenience of the odd network blip. And my ISP seems to be more stable than most. Very few drops. Maybe one blip like you experienced every 3-4 months or so.

The calculus is different for everyone. :)

cordcutters,"For those that don't know, the CRTC regulates all broadcasts in Canada. Unlike the US, that includes content on Sirius/XM and all media streaming in Canada. Sidenote: The CRTC had complaints about Howard Stern which Sirius/XM had to deal with. If the CRTC does to internet streaming what they did to voip, it'll kill off most of the industry. 

What I mean is this: The CRTC put a requirement on VoIP providers to provide basic 911 service and collect fees, just like the telephone companies. Lots of VoIP providers closed up shop as a result. 

If the CRTC forces ""must-carry"" on the internet streaming companies (CBC, CTV, Global, et al), how many will just give up on the Canadian market? It's only 35 million people which translates to about 12 million households. Is it worth having less than 6 million customers (assuming 40% market saturation in streaming devices),having to deal with that mess, and also increasing the costs by $20/mo or more (most companies charge about $25 for the CRTC mandated ""skinny bundle"")?

Actually they were auctioned off, much of the data is still around and or saved by the development team.    

&gt;When Foundation closed down, the servers – along with the content – were auctioned off. Much of the content may have been saved by artists who worked on the series, but it would have to be tracked down. No matter how you slice it, it would be a considerable amount of work to re-integrate the entire Voyager visual effects server and re-render the FX in HD. In addition, although the series was shot on film, the entire post-production process was finished on NTSC video; to create an HD episode of Voyager, Paramount would have to go back to the vaults, re-transfer the film and [re-build] the episodes from scratch using the original editing data – if THOSE files still existed."" [3]

&gt;However, in 2013, former Foundation staffer Robert Bonchune came forward as one of these artists who did save all of Foundation's Star Trek CGI files, elaborating, ""If they ask one of us – and if they use a team that uses LightWave – it’ll be much easier for them to redo... because the guys who worked on it, like me, have the assets. We have the original ships; we have most of everything that was used [in the making of the series]. That would eliminate a ton of the cost of rebuilding."" [4] In 2017, it was one of the co-producers of the Director's Edition, David C. Fein, who has confirmed Bonchune's assessment, by stating it was he who still had all the original digital effects elements available for remastering to Blu-ray standards. [5]

What plan do you actually have?

I don't think I've ever seen an ISP advertise a package with a range like that. Usually, it'll be a set number with a footnote. *eg a 100Mbps plan with a footnote that actual speeds may vary.*

I'm not saying your speeds are acceptable either way, but there's a huge difference between getting 15Mbps on a 45Mbps plan and getting 10Mbps on a 100Mbps plan. *It would also change how I'd start troubleshooting.*

I doubt they'd say that without adding more. 

What reason are they giving for you receiving those speeds?",1529065814
cordcutters,"Exactly. I'm pretty sure they'll follow almost exactly the same plan.

I expect T-Mo will add the Sprint LTE towers to the T-Mo network within 2-4 months of the acquisition. Here's what I (roughly) expect:

1. T-Mobile users gain access to Sprint LTE.
2. Sprint stores start advertising ""now T-Mobile"", and offering free SIM cards to existing Sprint customers. Most smart phones are already global-capable, and they will have T-Mobile compatible phones available for free for the older customers using ""feature"" phones. Anyone wanting new phones or plans are given T-Mobile phones and plans.
3. Billing will go from Sprint+T-Mobile to just T-Mobile as they finish putting Sprint plans into their system and move customers over.
4. After having given 1-year notice, T-Mobile starts dismantling the Sprint CDMA network and infrastructure. This is especially important, considering that Sprint CDMA runs at 1900 MHz, the same as their band 25, and T-Mobile band 2. As the CDMA is shut down, new band 2 LTE is deployed from those towers.
5. Remaining Sprint stores are either closed or fully rebranded.
6. T-Mobile begins testing home Internet, ""5G"", and streaming television service in select markets.
7. Around this time, T-Mobile band 12 and 71 become fully mature. Behind the scenes, T-Mobile moves all towers to bands 2,4,12, 26 and 71. 26 is the only Sprint band that's particularly useful (850 MHz), and band 25 gets rolled in to T-Mobile band 2 which becomes a wider band with higher capacity. (Both 2 and 25 operate at 1900 MHz)
8. Now that the network is ready for prime time, T-Mobile begins rolling out services such as home Internet, ""5G"", and live TV nationwide.

I would expect step 4 around 18 months after the acquisition, and the rest to happen over the following 18 months.",1530301122

cordcutters,"&gt; Mine is 1tb

So was mine. I went over it all 7 months that I had Comcast. 275meg for almost $200 a month.  AT&amp;T Fiber 1G came into the area for $80 a month and no data cap. Had it installed the day after I found out about it. Never looked back. ",1528991365
cordcutters,"&gt; why waste money on overpriced license, when you can just buy the content outright and own the rights forever.

It's crazy that just 7(?)ish years ago they were probably paying peanuts for those licenses because streaming was just an add-on service. ",1528253081
cordcutters,"Disney probably didn't even want it.  Fox News is loss making by itself, the profit is made there is by parroting right wing talking points that in turn make money for it's patrons through shaping legislation brought on by misleading the ignorant masses.",1529543950
cordcutters,"I just had both. They're both excellent quality with a cluncky guide. YouTube TV offered all four of the major local channels (ABC CBS NBC and FOX.) Direct TV had a slightly better channel lineup, but no local channels at all. Just look at what you want.",1528500434
cordcutters,"Looks like they have the last month of episodes [free on the NBC website](https://www.nbc.com/dateline/episodes). Episodes earlier than that needs a Cable/Streaming subscription with your local NBC station.

Update: Should also be available via NBC apps.",1530234657
cordcutters,"Yeah I have multiple PCs with multiple OSes (XP, Seven, Ten, Mac OS) so I just switched to a different machine.  It did surprise me though to discover Sling did not work on XP, since I watch tons of other Streaming videos on that computer (not blocked).

cordcutters,"their landline service is still pretty solid. it costs too much .... but if you live out in the country where service for cellphones isn't always reliable OR you live in town and prefer the landline experience over cellphones then it's a good way to go. ",1530210873
cordcutters,"“... for a House vote on the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to nullify Pai's Restoring Internet Freedom order rolling back net-neutrality rules.”

I’m really glad they named all these things simply and clearly so everyone can understand.",1528444384
cordcutters,"&gt; I read about services like YouTube TV. Is there something like that for Canada?

The CRTC and Bell/Rogers/Shaw have not allowed any service of this type to launch in Canada.

The only 'streaming-only' skinny basic service is via Bell but you can only get it if you ALSO subscribe to their unlimited Fibe internet package.

What shows/channels are you looking for?

If you live in a major city, you may be able to get some channels with an Over-the-Air antenna which is the only other live TV alternative. ",1529329690
cordcutters,"60% is only in France afaik know but yeah its true in general.

Its anywhere between 40 and 60 (depending on a country) so the average would be closer to 50%.

but thats taxes overall - you cant talk just about healthcare, because taxes overall goes for healthcare, education, defense, governance (government employees), civil services (police, firefighters) and many other things. From the top of my head.

In general you pay less in taxes but you probably have to pay for more things out of your own pocket.

cordcutters,"The CM-2018 would be a good choice, as you have VHF-Hi channels Do you have a balcony by any chance? If an enclosed unit, I would recommend a Winegard Flatweave.

By the way, you **ARE** allowed, Per federal government to erect an aerial, so long as you do not modify the building in any way, assuming a renter).  Use a tripod and cylinder blocks to keep it stationary.

cordcutters,"CBS all access is especially good for fans of classic shows. You get all the episodes of original Hawaii 50, Perry Mason, MacGyver, ect.  Each of those shows ran about 10 seasons. It's not for everyone, but I assume it appeals to a certain niche audience.",1528658219
cordcutters,"I have that tuner, and you can do this on Windows 7 with kodi + ServerWMC (which requires WMC to be installed and configured first). HD TV is pretty high bandwidth, though, so might choke the network. This would also require a kodi client at each TV, too.",1527870827
cordcutters,I try to follow my rule that I will not watch a new show unless I know at least the second season has started filming.  At the same time I am also getting really frustrated with these 10-12 episode “seasons”.  That is not a season it is a mini-series.,1530295516
cordcutters,"Most importantly it lets you choose the feed. I have two antennas on too different mountains sending the same channels, some come in better depending on which feed my antenna is taking. The old guide just had one feed an I couldn't tune curtain channels. ",1529016959
cordcutters,"No, New Fox is not buying Sky. The international business, including the Sky stake, is part of the 21CF assets Disney and Comcast have tabled bids for. Disney is separately offering to buy Sky News to help 21CF’s buyout of Sky Europe overall go through.",1529458197
cordcutters,"Please run a [TVFool](http://www.tvfool.com).  Go to TV Fool and enter in your address.  It will tell you what is broadcasting in your area, how far the towers are away from your home, what type of antenna you'll likely need, and how to aim your antenna.

cordcutters,"Same, robocallers don't leave a voicemail and if they do my phone transcribes it and I can see at a glance if it's junk or not. Then it's really easy to just block the number

Who the hell makes personal calls these days? No, I'm not a millennial, I'm 46.",1528551152
cordcutters,They took away native youtube from FireTV 6 months ago. The only thing it changed is that now when you click the youtube icon a warning comes up asking if you want to open it in silk or firefox. You select one and the functionality is about 99% identical.,1528388599
cordcutters,"Yep. I love their service. Great speeds and rock solid stable. Only outages I've had were planned maintenance at 2am it whatever. They're also a good company that doesn't snoop on traffic and advocates for Net Neutrality

cordcutters,"true but if you live out in the country of 75% or more of this country that's not the case. all the same the phone companies that are laying out fiber do it through the phone line jacks so you'd still have the landline experience with a fiber connection. ",1528479608
cordcutters,"I was a Vue subscriber when Viacom disappeared from that service, and I never missed any of their channels.  I started looking for alternatives when Vue raised my bill $10 a month with no corresponding increase in selection or quality (I couldn't care less about locals).  

If Viacom channels get added to YTTV in a basic package, there would be pressure to raise prices.  Might not be immediately for us grandfathered folks, but it will happen eventually.  Keep Viacom off YTTV or make it an optional add\-on.",1528642362
cordcutters,"IN...A...LAB

There is no real world cable plant that well sealed from ingress of noise. We literally have guys driving around JUST to catch ingress and trap customers out. And we have only like 16,000 cable modems. 

Not to mention the back bone required for that. I don't think a CMTS exists that could handle that speed in real world application. We use Arris E6000's. You would seriously need an entire CMTS per node. And no more than like 50 customers per CMTS lol. 

(my math is probably wrong, but still)",1530107183
cordcutters,"The tech doesn't make any difference to the user, so you are incorrect.  I never have to stop at a gas station to fuel my VOIP phone.  I never have to worry about the transmission making weird noises.  Your example is bad.

As far as plugging into the router, again, this makes no difference.  It plugs in.  That is all that matters.

As for sound quality, I have no issues.  It sounds the same as a landline, and is more reliable than a cell phone.  International calling is far cheaper, as is the monthly fee.",1528591883
cordcutters,"You’re absolutely right. Sometimes creators are lazy and a few times their shows are cancelled before they can do something about it, but there are always rumors, so they should do exactly as Babylon 5 creator did.

In a second thought, the creators of “How I Met Your Mother” always asked to be told in advance when the show would be cancelled so they could show who the mother is and end the story and we all saw how well that show ended. Worst ending ever and it still seemed rushed for some reason.
