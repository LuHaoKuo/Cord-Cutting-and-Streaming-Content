When you look at the DirecTV splitter, does it indicate that it receives electrical power from another source? If so, is that injector further down the load, plugged into an outlet? (If not, then the splitter will not act properly.)

&gt; What specifically will I need to buy for that? A grounding block, wire and a metal rod to put in the ground?

Whatever path you go, make sure to ground both the antenna mast (the DirecTV pole, if it's not currently grounded), and the coaxial just before it enters the house.

For the antenna mast, a simple grounding clamp from Home Depot or Lowe's is good.

For the coaxial, a TII-212 ground block/surge protector from Amazon.

For both grounds, use 10 AWG (gauge) copper, like from Amazon (search Amazon for B00JJTPWII as a starting point, but look for the best prices).

On the other end of the copper wire from both grounds, connect to your electric company outside circuit box (best) or outside metal water pipes (but only if they meet specific criteria) or grounding rod (must meet specific criteria), etc.

So for example i just looked at the app on my iPhone and I see that Daily show episodes between June 28th and June 25th can be seen (that's most recent week aired as they have been on break until July 16th).  Anything older has the ""lock"" meaning you need a login.  For the Daily show, I think I've seen it available on the app right after it airs, so you don't need to wait a couple of days to see it.  I noticed that four episodes of South Park are out there free too.

Sports channels will always be 720p and its a mix for everything else.

What they do to pack more channels in is adjust is the bitrate for each channel. Comcast owned channels on Comcast boxes will have higher bitrates than competitors. Sports and premium channels will also be given a higher bitrate. Stuff like CSPAN, the shopping network, and weather channels will be allocated the lowest bitrates.

I said, ""yeah, remember growing up antenna service before satcomms, how it used to be staticky shit that was barely watchable?  That's changed.  What you're watching now is free with my antenna.""

The look on her face was about the equivalent if I told her that I found $5000 on the street, and the police let me have it.  She was absolutely dumbstruck. :)",1532984746

That's odd. Do you have any local sources of interference? You can turning off all your electronics, including LED and CFL lights, to check. Are there any close 700 MHZ cell towers?

cordcutters,"I started with OTA then a FireTV and an Apple TV years ago.
I now have two Roku 4K TV’s with Apple 4ks connected to both.
I use the Roku TV’s 99% of the time.
The OTA guide and app integration is second to none.
BTW- I have been a cord cutter for over 10 years",1532276595
cordcutters,"Note that some multi-pane insulating windows have metallic films that will block tV signals. You might want to try other spots, particularly away from any electronics that might be causing interference.

Is the roof or the attic a possible place to put an antenna?",1531302151
cordcutters,"That may the promotion rate.  Note that unless you are in a New England or select parts of the east coast, data caps are common for Comcast. Also consider getting business class internet which usually has no data caps or look for a reseller. (Eg WOW or EarthLink.)",1530725830
cordcutters,They have so many projects with potential it's kind of crazy that they don't even have a platform yet.  There's no way this is free on iOS with all that they're investing which begs the question as to whether this service will eventually come to non-Apple devices.,1531366902
cordcutters,VHF antennas can be very tricky. I use an old set of rabbit ears for a PBS station that is still on VHF Ch. 7.  I have to reduce the length of both elements and align them in a particular way. One element is longer than the other. I'll try to post a picture later.,1531223051
cordcutters,"Yeah, it was down for most of the 2nd half, and it kept failing on me throughout extra time, requiring a refresh. This is the first time it's failed on me since I subscribed late last year, but I'll certainly be looking to see if it fails with similar live events.",1531342997
cordcutters,"very helpful....thx.  i am especially interested for my wife.  she just wants to watch what she wants to without having to spend much time figuring out how to get it.  i want to make a simple spreadsheet for her reference purpose.  the user profiles are helpful.

",1532271899
cordcutters,"Will do. Fortunately my other mohu’s do good enough for what I’m after. At this point I really just need CBS as Directv now has added a few of the other local channels that I originally had to get OTA. 

I’m going to try my cheap RCA antenna first to see if I can pick it up. I have a feeling it will as the outside tv is literally the best spot in the entire house to get channels. The more I’ve read, the more people discourage others to get Mohu. Makes me rethink my entire setup lol. 

Thanks for the input. ",1531159605
cordcutters,"I don't give a fuck about the business. Investors might love Netflix for being a business, the rest of us loved them for providing content.

And what you're missing is that they were *the* streaming site. Anything you wanted was there. Who cares if there's ""just another"" one from Apple or Amazon or whatever, when everything they had was on Netflix anyway, and you already have Netflix? And that's what Netflix was like, for a *long* time.

And they used that time to get a massive technical lead. HBO has been competing on original content, and yeah, it is *the* thing that makes HBO valuable, because if they didn't have Game of Thrones and Westworld, why would anyone ever put up with how *insanely* shitty the HBO apps are? Or their infrastructure -- I haven't seen Netflix buffer in years, but HBO does, yet it almost always has lower quality and doesn't seem to offer 4K at all!

That may be the direction Netflix is going now, and I get that they have to do it, but it makes the whole experience worse than what they *were.*",1532149049

Off topic, but
Xbox one does seem to be one of the most cord cutter/media steaming friendly gaming devices.

I own both Xbox One and PS4 and the lack of streaming services on PlayStation are astounding. 

Buddy has cable and shared his Starz subscription with me (using the Starz app) I tried to pull it up on PS4, nada, don't see it.

But it is on Xbox One. Along with Cinemax and others.

cordcutters,"At a distance of 20ft, the speed of light is not a significant factor in latency and can be safely ignored as it will look like a rounding error.

And, you are wrong about signals in air taking longer than in wires. It's the opposite. Part of any RF calculation is something called ""Velocity factor"" which is the fraction of the speed of light in a medium. In air, the VF is 99.97% (relative to a vacuum). For wires, it's around 95% (I base this on calculations used to determine the length of a dipole antenna using insulated wire vs bare wire), which means 'c' almost 5% slower in wire compared to air. 

Anyhow, at 6m (about 20ft), it takes light 20ns (20 billionths of a second) to cross that distance. In that time, a 1GHz single core CPU will complete 20 instructions. For wire with a 95% VF, it takes 21ns to cross a distance of 6m. But even if the VF was 50% (common in some RF applications), the latency would double to a mere 40ns.

The real latency comes with the codecs, which can be improved by using custom built ASICs.",1531761461
cordcutters,"Amazon video has been having audio sync issues on most devices. I've had audio sync issues with both Roku and Nvidia Shield TV, but I've read that Apple TV also suffers from this issue. The audio delays seems to shift randomly through the videos.  

Amazon video's UI is horrible. And its lack of control for videos is also annoying. You can't scrub through the videos, selecting the subtitles or language is not easily accessible. Also it seems to only support UHD streaming if my shield is set to 4k 60Hz, if I set it to 59.96 only 1080p is available.  

The biggest advantage of Amazon video is that they carry really high quality video (higher bitrate video/audio and good 5.1 audio streams). But this also sometimes changes, they have released some episodes of new series with a lower quality encoding setting. Some people speculated they were going to give up on using high quality encodes to probably save bandwidth and server storage.  

Overall I have a love/hate connection with Amazon video. They are the best at somethings and the worst at others. Their biggest downfall seems to be Amazon having their own streaming devices, which in my opinion influences the quality of theirs apps on other streaming devices. It makes total sense that they would produce worst quality Amazon video apps for rival streaming devices to push customers to buy their Amazon Fire line up, but it's sad for enthusiasts that want the best streaming device with the best video/audio quality (which IMO still is the Nvidia Shield TV, despite its drawbacks).",1530664394

He's also very mobile, at his house one night, his girls another, then 2 days camping with friends, etc. Why would he want a cable modem if he could do it all from his cell phone?

Only that popup appears 10 minutes before movie's end and covers 1/3 of the screen. 

In 2018, customers won't put up with manipulative selling. They'll walk. Instead of seeking creative ways to slow churn - perhaps HBO should really work harder to avoid angry customers?

cordcutters,"Besides Hulu for network TV, nothing is a replacement for what Netflix was. The whole reason why Netflix stopped licensing stuff and focusing on originals was because distributors started jacking up prices, or even taking their stuff off the market because they want to invest in their own subscription services. Netflix is losing Disney content soon, not because Netflix wasn't willing to pay for the license, but because Disney didn't want to license anymore, with them planning to launch their own streaming service next year.

Netflix saw the writing on the wall and rather than gamble on whether they could afford to license stuff in a few years, they wanted to create a library of content that doesn't disappear on them. Hence them dumping $8 billion into Originals this year, with content covering practically every niche you can think of. So far, their subscription numbers say it's working.

&gt; Sports is very much schedule-driven, as is news programming on a dozen different channels ranging from CNN to MSNBC to Weather Channel.

With sports, I can understand, because you're likely to have spoilers for a game published *immediately* after the game, so you do actually want to watch them live.

News, though? Youtube, of all things, does a reasonable job of surfacing news I might be interested in while it's still relevant. HBO has Last Week Tonight, which is still going to be relevant if I watch it Monday morning instead of Sunday night.

&gt; Channels also remain seemingly the most effective way of organizing content...

...what? How? I mean:

&gt; Generally speaking, people know what they’re going to find on ESPN vs Fox News vs Disney Channel vs HGTV vs Lifetime.

And generally speaking, people know what they're going to find in the ""similar to"" suggestions when looking up a Disney movie on Netflix... but even in places where channels still make some sense, like Youtube, notice how Youtube keeps burying the ""subscriptions"" page and pushing people towards what the algorithm suggests? Channels are useful for the knowing-what-you're-getting part, but most seem way less useful for finding something to watch.

I haven't looked at cable in awhile, but scrolling through a program guide is what I find frustrating. I want my content organized by three things: Stuff I'm watching, stuff I've told the service I *want* to watch soon, and a search bar for everything else. This is actually the worst thing Netflix has been trying to emulate -- the ""continue watching"" box keeps getting pushed down under ""trending"" and shit.

&gt; Amazon eventually “rescued” the show and will now fully fund production. But again, without SyFy, the show was never on the air in the first place.... Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, The Office, The Americans, Family Guy, Futurama, etc.

You've cherry-picked some examples. Here's a few shows that were made without ads:

* Game of Thrones
* Westworld
* Stranger Things
* Altered Carbon
* most Marvel TV shows -- Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Daredevil, etc.

I know, I know, you said shows that *aren't* Netflix or Prime (or HBO or Hulu or...) exclusives. But why exclude those? I count hundreds, almost a *thousand* Netflix exclusives. And Game of Thrones is probably the most expensive show ever made, yet even on broadcast TV, it's shown without commercial breaks. There seems to be a ton of money in ad-free streaming services.

It's fair to say that without SyFy, The Expanse *probably* doesn't get made, because a show getting greenlit by *any* network (traditional or online) is a longshot, because there are way more good show ideas than there is budget to make them -- even *with* SyFy, if you could run the experiment again, The Expanse probably doesn't get made.

...I mean, to put a number on it, Facebook barely makes more than $2/mo/user. We're living in a weird dystopia where every aspect of our private lives is mined just to get us to click on ads, all to save us less than it would cost to go to the movies twice a year. I just don't buy that removing ads would either kill a ton of shows, or raise subscription prices enough to matter.",1532911596

I'm positive your viewing habits will change from what you watched with traditional cable. And once you get completely comfortable with streaming vs cable, you'll be less reluctant to change to another provider — maybe because of a good introductory promotion, or a channel line-up that appeals.

The fact that there are no contracts among streamers makes it worry free.

You'll probably decide to ""mix and match"" at some point, e.g. your ""main"" streaming source (DTVN or whoever) plus maybe an inexpensive antenna for over-the-air reception of local stations, and for movies, maybe Netflix, or Amazon Prime, or Hulu.

cordcutters,"Let me tack on to that. DOCSIS is DOCIS and you'll want either 3.0 or 3.1. Comcast uses a DOCSIS standard on their cable internet service. Fiber is another matter altogether.

What's on Comcast's ""approved list"" are modems that they'll sorta/kinda but mostly not support. Customer service will give ya a couple of minutes of assistance if you're having trouble setting up. Drop offs and other issues, you're on your own.

I grabbed a D-Link modem off the shelf at Costco for about $50 and never checked if it was on their list. It's a DOCSIS 3.0 compliant modem... I don't know or care whose chipset is in it... and it's rated for something just under 400Mbps. I pay for 100Mbps service but recently it's been ringing the bell at about 150 Mbps.

I really think your router/wireless setup will be more of an issue than your modem and it's where I would concentrate most of my resources.

If you go to r/HomeNetworking, I'll bet they'll point you towards an EdgeRouter X and Ubiquiti's ""lite"" WAP, but that's not a plug and play solution.",1532782548

If you are using wifi, do a little research and buy a decently powered router.

Yes, because they're using 4G and don't WANT a home internet connection. Or they're poor and won't be buying $70 a month fiber. 

What people in San Francisco are ACTUALLY bitching about is that fiber optic internet (FTTH) isn't everywhere because SF is a PITA to wire. There's no way the city can do it for $1.9 billion, more like $19 billion, all of which is digging up the roads. And remember this is being designed specifically as a money pit that loses millions annually.

Secure the antennas to the roof. These need to be separated at least 8.64 feet. Mount the first antenna in the center of the roof. Mounting will vary and instructions can be found with the antenna. Attach the second antenna above the first one, making sure to leave the proper distance. Once again instructions will be provided.

Otherwise, go shop around for a damn long HDMI cable and a decently reviewed HDMI splitter, and do what you gotta do.

The deal maker for me is Comcast's superfluous fees associated with tv, to change on their own whims. $10 per hookup, $8 for ""free"" OTA, $3.50 RSN... those fees alone almost pay for Sling blue that had every cable channel we ever watch. YMMV (and I'll mention, you said NFL Network, the 30fps on Sling will probably sour your experience. Not sure how other providers are, but that is pretty noticeable). You also have phone so there are probably other junk fees on top there also; I've had MagicJack for the last 11 years (along with a cell) and never looked back.

Is there another house next door, inline with the signal? Even more signal loss.  
If it has to be inside the house, then the attic is usually the least amount of signal loss, assuming a normal plywood roof and asphalt shingles, no metallic backed insulation, no metal roofing.

- Vue: Doesn’t carry any of my local broadcast networks so I’d be forced to watch the VOD anyway, with the same forced commercials.

Switch from the live to DVR version of an episode is easy, just select start over from the menu and it will switch but again it needs to be on your shows list first. ",1531116378
cordcutters,"I don't think they have a choice in the matter, unfortunately. I'm sure they're hemorrhaging money, and they are probably approaching theaters to discount ticket prices.

After the two weeks, for a discount, Moviepass will bring people in. Unless it's a movie that will need the help in it's first two weeks.

I don't think it's about courting anymore. It's about trying to stay alive by any means necessary. As others have mentioned, this is a downward spiral. The business model could not survive as it was. And yes, as can be seen by the many people in this thread, they're contemplating jumping ship. Moviepass is losing its demographic with these changes.",1533060937
cordcutters,"This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/fcc-votes-to-open-c-band-for-wireless-broadband) reduced by 69%. (I'm a bot)
*****
&gt; The FCC has unanimously voted to find ways to open up the C-band spectrum for terrestrial wireless use, either all of the 500 Mhz or some portion of it, and through either an incentive or capacity auctions, a market mechanism where incumbents voluntarily strike deals to reduce their footprint, or some other means.

&gt; The FCC wants to open it up to wireless broadband to help close the digital divide and promote 5G, both prime directives for the commission.

&gt; Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel agreed, but said the FCC is playing catch-up in the midband spectrum clearing space, and needed to be less opaque about what spectrum it is freeing up, and when.

On the bright side, you don't miss much by not watching it.

No extra scenes or similar.

PS: Was just browsing VRV Select and they've got a lot of weird niche stuff in there that's hard to find legally elsewhere.

And that is going to cost them more money.


&gt;I dropped directv and added hulu saving myself $1,680 every year(roughly $11,700+ since cutting cable).

So you want to do a ""money grab"" for yourself, it makes sense.

CBSSN (CFB&amp;CBB)
NBCSN (Hockey, some CFB, racing, etc)
NFLN
MLBN
NBATV
BTN
TBS (MLB)
TNT(NBA), TRU, TBS, CBS (MARCH MADNESS)
Local channels (depending on your area) 
Regional sports networks 

Plus there are add-ons for soccer and you can also add Redzone if you want for the upcoming season. So no shortage of sports to watch, with full DVR.

cordcutters,"Not sure what kind of ISP you have, I have cable, and I went and bought a Arris cable modem from them I think it was $50, that way it's gonna be compatible, and they put it in the ""system"" so I didn't have to call tech support or try to find and see if the online modem registration web-page was still working.

As far as routers go, they all do the same thing.  I've gone through many brands over the years.  The latest were Dlink, Netgear and Asus.

The Netgear AC 1450 router worked fine, but the menus and status screens didn't show much info or have access to configure/tweak ""advanced"" features.  

The Dlink and the ASUS I liked better, as they showed more info and I could access more settings.  The Dlink was older and slower, and didn't have gigabit Wan/Lan, and that's why it got retired.

I'm currently using an ASUS AC 1900 router and it's working fine, it has gigabit, supports both USB 2.0 and 3.0, supports SMB (for NAS type access) and has a upnp/dlna media server too.  I have a couple of USB 3.0 drives connected to it through a hub, and it works.   The USB 3.0 is much faster than the USB 2.0, but it is far from being blistering or real NAS fast. But it's not bad considering that one doesn't have to fork out $$ for an actual NAS or USB NAS adapter.

The WiFi on the ASUS is strong and stable, I am using AsusWRT-Merlin firmware, because it gives even more access to settings, but the factory firmware was also not bad at all.

The newer AC 3x3 routers usually have good to great WiFi performance, and are not a slouch when it comes to moving data from the Wan port (internet) to the Lan port(s) (your network).

I would suggest that you don't go the route of all in one, since that means you have to replace everything at once if you need to upgrade or if you change ISP types (cable, fiber, ADSL).  Buying separately also means that you can upgrade the part that needs upgrading only, and I think it's easier to resell or pass on a modem or router versus a combo unit.  I had a combo unit when I got ASDL from ATT awhile back, and when I moved that basically became a paperweight since I decided to go with cable for faster speed and TV.  But this is my personal recommendation based on my experience, you will have to pick what works best for you.

Best of luck in finding/picking your next router/modem.  ",1532063382

Check out TVFool.com and plug in your address to see where your local stations are being broadcast from and what antenna you need. Then you can work on a DVR solution using your new antenna.. such as Plex, Tablo, TiVo etc. I personally use Plex. OTA antenna placement and getting it to work will get probably be the most frustrating part of cord-shaving. 

Every OTT service offers a free trial. You should definitely take advantage of that. Other OTT services you can check out are Philo, YouTube TV, and Hulu with live TV. Each has its pros, cons, and channel selections. Each site also has a local channel list tool where you can plug in your zip and it’ll show which locals you get.

This may not be all-inclusive but it’s a good start.

For me, I personally use an OTA antenna using a HDHomeRun tuner with Plex, Youtube TV and Philo.

Good luck!

The main drawback is fewer channels or missing certain channels but either that's not hard to work around, or frankly it's not like life is over if I don't see specific TV shows. There's more content on Netflix + YoutubeTV than I can watch in one lifetime already.

Cable TV is dead, but cable companies will do okay as internet companies until wireless finally puts them under. Network broadcasters will do fine so long as they can produce original content people want to see. HBO, Showtime, etc have proven the ""make content, people will sub to your channel for it"" model for 40 years or so.

35 for life falls into the “if it’s too good to be true...” category. I’ve seen it over and over again, but some people are too trusting of sales reps. Maybe I’m more astute to that kind of stuff because I used to be a sales rep.

In AT&amp;Ts case, I don’t put it all on the sales reps. The pressure to produce numbers comes straight from the top. I know first hand of instances where reps are told to tell customers something that isn’t honest. If they dont, they are written up for not “following the key behaviors”. 

I suspect there will be even more customers that come on here that think they had that price for life.

&gt;I don't know why people keep throwing around bandwidth caps. Six years ago it was all about ""unlimited will never be back."" Now it is. And on the unlimited plans you're de-prioritized after a certain amount and that amount keeps creeping up. TMo is at 50GB/mo now. It's just going to keep going up until there is, essentially, no throttling for the vast majority of users.  
  
As a VZW employee with a grandfathered 50 dollar unlimited feature on an old 700min plan, the new unlimited plans are subject to a ton more network management. The old plan is truly the ""dumb pipe"" service I want from a provider. Side by side against all models of phones we sell, no other phone on no other plan matches it. I can have 100MB app installed before the same device on Beyond unimites is hall done DLing.

cordcutters,"I'm confused by your comment (is ""sarcasm"" the right word instead of ""comment""? It's unclear the tone you're taking). It almost sounds like you're arguing that net neutrality affected the rate at which ISPs can rate limit the resolution of streaming video. If so, you might recall the ""Binge-On"" marketing campaign from T-Mobile back in like 2015-2016 where you could stream certain content without it counting against your data, or Verizon throttling Netflix on its unlimited plan. Don't forget the time AT&amp;T forced Apple to throttle VoIP services like Skype for all iPhone users. 

Throttling of bandwidth-intensive content has always and will always (in the foreseeable future) occur regardless of net neutrality. Despite the superficial view (and i'm sure this unpopular opinion will result in down voting), net neutrality was, in it's most recently-mandated form, both a poison for the providers and the consumers. I couldn't be happier net neutrality is gone. And if this is basically what you meant in not so many words, then I agree with you.",1530579221

cordcutters,"Not necessarily.

Internet speeds are influenced by two things, your modem (typically built into the router Comcast provides), and WiFi performance. If you are connecting to Ethernet to the router, WiFi is not a factor, but your network could be if inferior wires, or switches are used.

It is unlikely Comcast would supply a modem\\router that is underrated for the service level you pay for, but not out of the question. More likely than not, WiFi may be slowing you down. There are several reasons for this.

With Comcast routers, by default they broadcast a XFinity ""public"" or guest WiFi signal that any Comcast customer can use, which ultimately shares your modem's bandwidth. If you live in densely populated areas, this could be a significant factor. Also, most WiFi routers support both 2.4 and 5Ghz frequencies, 2.4 is prone to interference from other networks, microwaves, wireless things like bluetooth and keyboard\\mouse, etc. There are a limited number of channels in 2.4 and most default to Channel 6 which is where most interference is concentrated. Changing channels can help. 5Ghz, while less prone to interference but capable of greater speeds, has a shorter range. Higher end routers may improve 5Ghz range and bandwidth, but in the end, the service level with Comcast may be restricting your internet speeds which will never be any faster than your service level (give or take).

Start with your service level, what are you paying for? To test if you are getting close to this, connect a PC to the router via Cat5e or Cat6 ethernet cable and run a speed test. This will determine if your modem is adequate. Then, do a site survey to see what WiFi in the area looks like, if there are a lot of WiFi networks showing up, note the channels they are using and try setting your channels different to limit interference. Finally, if the router allows you to use a different WiFi name (SSID) for 5Ghz, try setting that up to be different (NETWORK and NETWORK5G for example), then connect to the 5G network and test speeds. Often, devices will connect to 2.4Ghz if the SSID is the same because of perceived signal strength. But, since 5Ghz tends to be faster, even with a slightly lower signal strength, 5G may be faster. Plus, using 5Ghz on devices that are capable frees up the 2.4Ghz bands for devices that can only connect to 2.4.

For the best advice, provide some hints such as:

* Comcast service level (50Mbps, 100Mbps, 250Mbps, etc).
* Rough size of home, how many floors, how many close neighbors, where the router sits in the home (central, top or bottom floor, etc).
* How many WiFi networks do you see when you go to select a network to connect to?
* What kind of devices are you using on your network (PC\\Mac, iOS\\Android phones, Streaming devices\\SmartTV, SmartHome\\WiFi cameras, etc).
* What are your current actual speeds (use [speedtest.comcast.net](https://speedtest.comcast.net) or [www.fast.com](https://www.fast.com), or Speedtest by Ookla app on iOS, Android, etc.).
* What (if any) issues are you currently experiencing.

Your question is pretty vague, and you may end up spending a lot of money for little benefit if you use the blindfold piñata approach. While buying a modem and router can be less expensive in the long run (versus paying $10-12\\month to rent the Comcast router), it is easy to overspend for the service level you are paying for. You could spend $300-500 for top end Modem and Router gear and get little speed improvement if your service level is 50Mbps from Comcast. Or, you could spend $150-200 and be under powered for a 1Gbps Comcast service level.",1532008327

Can't recommend them enough, at least in the metro Detroit area. ",1531520930
cordcutters,"I would respectfully disagree with your assertion that you need low expectations to be satisfied with current streaming options.  We've tried them all and some are better than others for sure.   Many will find channels missing from one or more of the services, or other features that will dictate what they would consider as an option for their home.   

However, we actually have a better channel lineup with PS Vue's Elite than we had with cable, and are saving over $900 per year based on what cable cost us over two years ago (so I imagine we'd be saving a LOT more now).  

Streams from several of the OTT providers has been as solid as cable or satellite, with picture quality just as good or better.   On Vue we have 5 streams at a time, an unlimited DVR for 28 days (and let's face it, if you don't watch it in 28 days it's probably going to repeat several times during that time and will stay on your DVR perpetually, as I've noticed with many shows).  

I have never missed one sporting event or other show I've wanted to watch, and neither has anyone else in the household.  

I don't think we've given up one thing except bloated pricing, crappy equipment, and poor customer service.   Just equipment fees, junk fees, and taxes, those ""below the line fees"", were more on our cable bill than what Vue costs us.  Then you have to add their programming fee on top of all that junk.

YouTube TV, Philo, and Hulu all were very good for us also.   Had lesser, but still acceptable, experiences with Sling, DTVN, and Fubo.

Without a doubt, it is a personal choice based on individual/family needs, but there are many of us who are thrilled with the services we have and would never go back even if cable lowered all their costs to truly be comparable.   I honestly feel we have better service than we had with cable.   ",1532475920

cordcutters,"You can get an HD HomeRun on amazon or bestbuy.. they have several models, but you’ll be interested in either the connect or Quatro.. they are both OTA tuners. The only difference is the number of tuners. The connect had 2 and the Quatro has 4.  You can go to https://www.silicondust.com to learn more. I believe the Quatro is 100 bucks. The type of antenna solely depends on your location. Outdoor is better than indoor but indoor is easier to set up. I have an outdoor antenna in my attic that I feed to the HDHomeRun. You can also get something like a tablo .. which is easier for beginners to setup. Then you don’t need the HDHomeRun. The Tablo already has the tuners built in. They are available on Amazon and you can read up on it at tablotv.com. 

Or..if you don’t need a DVR for locals... you can get an antenna and plug it directly to your tv.. assuming your tv has a tuner built in. Most do. 

The first thing I will do if you want an antenna is buy a cheap one from Walmart and point it to where your stations are.. plug it into the tv and see if it works and if you can get the channels you want. Then you can worry about permanent placement and setting up an OTA DVR if you want. Make sure you can return the antenna if it doesn’t work. A quick summary.. each antenna has a range. You can figure out how far away your stations are by going to tvfool.com. It’ll also suggest the type of antenna. For example.. if your stations are 20 miles away, you’ll have an easier time than if they are 60+ miles away. Some antennas are omnidirectional.. meaning they can receive signal from multiple angles.. others are directional, meaning you have to point them to the station. Since you want to receive several stations, your best hope is that all the stations are coming to you from the same general area. Sounds confusing, but it gets easier as you play around.  

I use Plex for my own content. It involved installing it on a computer that’s always on. I use it as my OTA DVR, but it won’t replace Netflix or amazon video.  You can read about Plex at Plex.tv. You do need a plexpass for the DVR to work.

But of course, if you find an OTT tv provider like sling has the locals you watch, then you may not need an antenna. It’s easier to install an app on a Roku and log in than to set up an OTT antenna with a DVR.",1532266654

cordcutters,"From the article linked in the OP:

""Latency – which refers to the time it takes for data to travel from a user’s device to the server and back – will be measured on both unloaded and loaded connections. Unloaded latency measures the round-trip time of a request when there is no other traffic present on a user’s network, while loaded latency measures the round-trip time when data-heavy applications are being used on the network.

For example, let's say you’re playing a game online on your computer. If you’re the only user on the network, then the time between your gaming action (like moving a mouse or clicking it) and the response from the gaming server will approximately match the unloaded latency measurement. However, if someone else is streaming a movie, backing up photos or performing other data-intensive tasks on the same network at the same time, your gaming response time would correspond to the loaded latency measurement. Ideally, those two values for unloaded and loaded latency should be close to each other. If not, that might explain your poor experience with latency sensitive applications (like gaming, video calls or web surfing) under heavy network usage, and you may want to check your home network setup (bufferbloat.net has useful recommendations) or consult with your ISP.""",1531855892

cordcutters,"OK, it appears as though circumstance have conspired against me.  Or the best laid plans.....

I got 170 Mbps from my home computer, hard wired.  I got other values from iPhone at about 10 AM after Comcast did a ""maintenance last night"" that prevented me from accessing web pages or email at 6AM.  

I just check speed with iPhone and got 50+ by the TV and higher next to the Airport.  So wifi seems fine, right now.

Also, I did some checking and Xfinity (the new stupid name for Comcast stuff) has an app for Netflix.  My first impression is that the picture hard wired DVR and Netflix app is not as good as wifi Apple TV and Sharp Aqueos TV.

I have to say that in my area, Comast is never (rounds to zero) down.  It always seems to be up. My only gripe was the price coupled with low offers for new subscribers.  Seemed to be a penalty applied for rewarding loyalty. There are lots of cosmetic gripes: the fast forward obscures too much of the screen, the xfinity button comes up on Guide when I have a separate Guide button already.  Last takes pushing the button and pushing the center OK button.  Constant little things that will eventually get me to quit.

So now I'm back with the fundamental question:  Comcast slow down or Netflix.  I'll do a computer and iPhone speed test when I notice the picture degrade.  I'll also investigate Comcast Netflix app vs Apple TV Netflix.  I was astounded that the whole look is different between the Apple TV and Comcast Netflix screen displays. The Comcast remote is a mystery with the Netflix app.

Video quality was actually better than expected but the availability of on demand was worse than expected. Actually not too much buffering. (My internet was extremely slow then)  I ended deciding that the channels were not what I wanted (no locals)

DirecTV Now: Tried this last fall for almost two months. Absolutely hated the UI. Had trouble getting to the right place.  I found it crashed alot on my Roku and tended to buffer alot. It's on demand was extremely limited. You really need a fast internet for this and newest streaming device possible for this service.

On Demand: Netflix. I loved it before they branched out into originals because it meant I could binge watch a season. (This was before live streaming services.) Too times they would stop carrying the last two seasons of a show. Video quality was good. UI design changes haven't necessarily been for the better.

* CBS All Access

Hulu has the new UI on my Roku and the old UI on my Fire Tablet (4th gen I think). New UI has been solid for me. I don't seem to get buffering on it. I don't love the colors or its recommendations page. Biggest annoyance is how it does this overlay at the end of any episode while auto starting the next one. I haven't bothered to turn off that setting to see what happens without it. Old UI on tablet crashes lot and buffers. Uncertain if that is the tablet or the UI. Both are via WiFi.

CBS All Access is something I am glad exists because I watch enough CBS shows on demand that I would need to buy alot of season passes if this didn't exist. Hulu with Live TV or Vue would work if it is possible to record CBS (I think so) but that is more than Hulu + CBS All Access. It has gotten better but still buffers on nights when there are lot of people using All Access (Star Trek Discovery). I find it generally easy to navigate although they keep changing UI. I only subscribe in winter. One thing to note: if CBS All Access offers you a free month after you have cancelled, do NOT take it. There is a bug in their system which resets a date and you will get charged.

cordcutters,"It really depends what all ends up on their streaming service. Most Marvel/Star Wars fans end up seeing the movies while they're in theaters, so unless you are big on rewatching those wouldn't inspire a monthly subscription.

cordcutters,"While this is great for comic book fans who are digging this expansive cinematic universe, it stinks for the future of theatrical movies as a whole.

Disney will control 40% of the box office and their contracts for keeping movies playing has been notoriously reported. They will effectively have the power to shut other movies out of the box office.

cordcutters,"""Code is code"" is *massively* oversimplifying.

Here, I can prove my point with one statistic: [About a quarter of the games on Steam are available for Linux.](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/616hqw/how_many_steam_titles_support_linux/) That's on exactly the same hardware, so this should be *easier* than porting between wildly different hardware. And this is only looking at Steam games, not Windows Store games, so exactly nobody is getting a kickback from Microsoft for excluding Linux. Even if that were possible, there are more Mac games than Linux games, and there's zero chance that Apple and Microsoft have banded together to make sure some games don't make it to Linux.

But because of OS differences alone, most developers decide porting games even to other PC OSes is too much work.",1532150457
cordcutters,"Ok cool. Out of all the options I am liking this the most. Can you explain the server thing more. Do I basically just connect an antenna to the HDhome run, and then connect it to my computer and the computer should be connected to my router through wi-fi or ethernet and that will allow all devices on wi-fi or ethernet with a plex app to use it and plex pass comes with DVR too? How many hours of DVR do we get? I think I am really liking this option. My next problem is figuring out what to do about good signal. I only have a bunch of flat antennas and I can put them upstairs, but sometimes if it is too windy even they get bad connection and I really don't want to work on the roof and I don't know if the owner would like that either. Lastly, I don't need a separate computer for the plex server right? ",1531182985

&gt; The report excludes satellite Internet &amp;quot;Because the technology is highly dependent on terrain and weather, has very poor latency, and is often more expensive than terrestrial ISPs.&amp;quot; Mobile broadband also is not included because the report focuses on home Internet service, rather than smartphone coverage.

&gt; The nation&amp;#039;s biggest cable company and broadband provider, offers service to about 110 million people in 39 states and Washington, DC. &amp;quot;All of these people have access to broadband-level service through Comcast Xfinity, but about 30 million of these people have no other option for broadband service,&amp;quot; the ILSR wrote.

&gt; &amp;quot;About 47.9 percent of people in the total service area have access to broadband-level service through CenturyLink and approximately 1 million people have no other option for broadband service,&amp;quot; the report said.

cordcutters,"&gt; Don't expect to play online games or stream a lot of tv.

I would like to *HIGHLY* contest this.

Online games require on the order of less than 1Mbit, when it comes to the said low jitter traffic needs. This drastically changes when doing a dedicated server, but only per client and on the network stack used for the game.

I've been able to stream youtube on the highest settings on a connection at 10, and 20Mbit. 

Let me also say a caveat though. I am a network engineer, and I have higher end routers at home that let me be very specific with how I pack my links with bits. So, while I might have an advantage in that sense, I still can't beat the laws of physics. 

That being said, 10mbit should suffice for damn near most internet needs except larger file downloads or super high bitrate streams.",1532218513
cordcutters,"Exactly.  They use that advantage to have more content than other services.  So I hear a lot of... well I have problems with DTVN.. but my kids have to have Nick so I stick with them.  Similarly since AT&amp;T is able to leverage wireless relationships for a DirecTV Now discount there is another group that puts up with DTVN problems solely because it’s cheaper since they are an AT&amp;T unlimited customer (which by the way they increased fees on so people may really be better off with Verizon + some other OTT) it’s rare that I hear someone liking DTVN purely for the reliability/service/functionality compared to YTTV, Vue, or Hulu. Which seems a shame that people putting out mediocre product are being rewarded more than people putting out a better product.  But this happens in many industries... ",1532873847
cordcutters,"Thanks for the reply.  My ""modem"".  I bought a Zoom 5341 DOCSIS 3.0 in 2015.  I'm just now reading about QOS, never heard of it before.  Could buy a new one, 3 years of saving the rental fee from Comcast is $360 (the Zoom was \~$80)!  I'll also be using my phone to do wifi speed test.  With Comcast, I need to make sure the modem/router is compatible/allowed.  I would love to have a hard wired Apple TV, but can't figure out how to do.  The cable comes into the house and is split into A and B.  A runs into the Xfinity box for TV and DVR functions.  B runs across the house (attic) and into the ""modem"" which is hardwired to an Apple Airport Extreme (tall box format, 2.4 and 5gHz).  That serves the Apple TV back by the TV (and near the DVR fed from A).  It would be great if the xfinity DVR had an ethernet out to run to that Apple TV, but it doesn't.  I don't think I can have 2 ""modems"" for my residential account.  I don't think I could run an ethernet cable from the existing modem to the Apple TV, it would require serious fish tape adventures in the wall.",1531502941

Compared to?

If everyone downloads 20 GB a month I need a much smaller backbone and can use older networking to support it, if everyone is downloading 2 TB. I need a different infrastructure a better one that can push more data, that costs more. Do I pass the cost onto the 20GB a month people or the 2 TB people? 

Keep in mind, this is affecting Comcast's connection to the internet somewhere down the line. Do they need a 1Tbps connection or 100Tbps connection? Do you think those two things are the same price?

Even if there is NO cost added for more data being downloaded. I still have zero problems with them charging casual users less and higher users more. But I'm talking reasonable numbers. Plus/minus $10-$20 per step (and only a few steps).

Think of it like a buffet restaurant: It's $14.95 and all you can eat, but kids are $3.95 and seniors are $7.95. They all have access to the same food, but they're not going to use as much so we charge them less. And they're not going to come to the table for $14.95. I don't like going to a Mongolian BBQ, I'm not a big eater and it's cost ineffective for me.

As a result the remote is very susceptible to RF interference and lag, even from components inside the Shield TV itself, despite a string of firmware updates to tweak things from the software side.

Nvidia has been advising to set their USB 3.0 ports to (USB 2.0) compatibility mode in order to really reduce interference, as well as using shielded USB drives and HDMI cables.  Plus resetting the BT and remote control system stack, and re-seating the coin cell batteries.

In comparison, everyone else's standard non-LE Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct remotes (and the Shield's own game controller) don't usually have as much lag or interference issues, even if you have to replace the AA/AAA batteries (or recharge) every few weeks.

When I called retention and told them I wanted to upgrade from 50/50 to 100/100 they said they need to send a tech out at the cost of $99. Because I ordered new service online under my GF’s name they waved the fee for the tech to come out.",1533052659

I recently moved from California (great cable service through Cox), to suburban NYC, where we were limited to Optimum cable complete with mid-90s cable box technology.  After a couple months, we gave up on the terrible cable box, figuring we could get everything we need with DirecTV Now.  This did save us some money, but didn't really translate to a better user experience.

Now that fios has rolled out in my area, the triple play bundle will be significantly cheaper than my existing internet service/DTV combination, and also offer far faster internet connection (it's not all about streaming; we've also got a baker's dozen laptops, phones, XBox, etc).

My only hesitation comes down to the cable box.  I've gotten spoiled using just the FireTV remote, and don't really want to return to the HDMI input switching all the time.

I second another suggestion already mentioned of dropping coax to a room or closet you want to designate as your data closet and place your HDHR and router in that closet. Just remember, though, that you will suffer greater losses over the same distance on coax than you will on Ethernet, so logic tells you that you want the shortest possible run of coax between the antenna and the HDHR.

cordcutters,"I agree. I still think these companies are testing the waters and trying to find what features sell and at what price point. Competition is always good. Look at Sling they were the first to the market and at the time had no traditional guide and no DVR. But the entrance of players like Vue, DTVN and others on the market forced them to develop these things. What’s nice to see is each of these services developing to cater to different crowds. If you want some choice and don’t care about locals get Sling. If you want a good DVR get YTTV or Vue.  If you want a great on demand offering get Hulu, and if you want a more traditional cable experience go for DTVN. 

It will be interesting to see how companies like Philo shake things up and to see what comes down the road with T-Mobile and others looking to tap into the cord cutter craze.

cordcutters,"As someone interested in fringe strength sports like powerlifting, strongman, and weightlifting, it’s incredible to see the drain to something like American football because that’s where the absolute freak athletes who could potentially destroy in something like WL or strongman go but I can’t blame them at all: that’s where the money is (or basketball and baseball included.) There is zero money in the hobby sports I follow. 

The weird thing to me, though, is how everyone grows up playing soccer at least a little bit in the US but people who have never stepped foot on the gridiron are direhard football fans.  I won’t lie and say I’m a huge soccer fan (or really any sport, I don’t get much out of watching) but soccer and lacrosse are the only two sports I can really enjoy watching much and that’s just because I spent the most years on them. Though TBH I think it’s because soccer can be a test of patience in a longer, unfolding strategy whereas you get more instant gratification in most popular US sports. Aside from baseball...that can be a SLOW game ",1530755728
cordcutters,"It was a big deal to Netflix when they could have to pay premiums for peering on different backbones so they won't be throttled.

Now that they are big enough that it doesn't really matter in a business sense, it isn't a big deal to the CEO anymore, who in the past was a very vocal proponent of net neutrality.

As I recall, and anyone correct me if I'm wrong, but Netflix also increased the price of DVD subscribers that streamed by separating the two subscriptions and charging for each, then called it a price reduction, even though you'd lose your DVD subscription. Then later, they of course increased the subscription price, so you basically had the same benefits for the same price, except for the DVD subscription.

Netflix then locks browsers out of 1080p and above if they don't support their DRM, so Chrome, Firefox, etc. are locked into lower bitrates and thus, lower resolutions.

Netflix, when it was the underdog, seemed to be fairly pro-consumer and pro-net neutrality. Now that they are huge, with a lot of momentum behind them, they seem to be turning their backs.",1531840490

Out of all the pro sports you watch, you should be covered with the exception of NFL Network (still might be added this fall, but who knows).  DTVN has all the other league networks (NHL Network, etc).  

Lineups also include ESPN networks, NBCSN (hockey and EPL), TNT (NBA), FS1 (MLB), and locals (NFL) vary by market.  DTVN doesn't have a PlayStation app, and prob never will.  I have an XBOX and plug a fire TV into that, not sure if that's an option with PS4",1532617198

A couple of times I have dropped both Hulu and CBS in the summer. I have gotten by with the CBS website/mobile app but hated it. (Mobile app has mobile ads too). I suppose Yahoo View could partially replace Hulu but I would probably watch more OTA instead or borrow DVDs from the library.

cordcutters,"It has been awhile, but I do remember having issues with other services, Vue I think had the same problem on Roku. Recently I saw on the Roku forum the same complaint, but I don't remember what service they were using. I'm not sure if an update from Roku resets the apps, or if the developers of the apps have some sort of time out in the apps themselves. But it is across all the apps, not just AMC, Nick, Discovery, etc., also need to be signed in again. That doesn't happen with Hulu, Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, or any other apps I use on Roku, just the TV Everywhere apps.",1531423414

HBO releases major productions, (GoT), the exact same instant that they hit the air.  Other shows (like Real Time with Bill Mahrer), are put on the next day.

Since you're with the apple ecosystem, I'd reccomend you stick with the Apple TV, since it will integrate better into your home network, (and itunes).  Roku is a decent device that's basically provide agnostic, but doesn't work with iTunes, since Apple hasn't made a version of it for Roku.",1532493328

I'm using it on a Fire Stick and the app is trash. The interface is incredibly slow, and I don't care for the layout.

I actually use on demand more than live TV, and had no idea to expect how bad it would be with this. The on demand selection is ABYSMAL. Very few shows for most of the networks I want, and then it's only partial seasons.

Not worth the $10 I paid, and would highly recommend using the free trial. I'll check free trials for other services, but am pretty sure I'll promptly be returning to Hulu w/Live. Also, DTVN just announced a $5 price hike, so I can't even justify it being slightly cheaper for much longer. ",1530591918

YouTube TV:  Best interface, best DVR (space, retention), best support for local channels, good quality, overall channel lineup is a little sports heavy (though it pairs well with another service called Philo.) Not on amazon devices, so have to decide if you’d be willing to upgrade that hardware.

Vue: Good interface, good DVR, good quality, good overall channel lineup, poor support for locals, most volatile service (price changes, channels added/dropped, packages switching.)

Directv Now: best picture, best channel lineup, mediocre local channel support, awful interface (poor navigation, bugs), awful DVR (space, retention, bugs)

Sling: Probably best value if either their Blue or Orange package has everything you want, poor support for locals, everything else is mediocre (picture quality, interface, DVR)",1532871828
cordcutters,"In last 5 years I've gone through 4 modems due to lightning strikes. The most recent being last Sunday...

I have to say it's pretty simple to just call Comcast and have them send out a new one (you return the old one in the packaging they send). They will tell you it will take something like 5-10 days but it's usually here in 2 or 3 (business days).

Additionally I've gone though about 6 or 7 cable boxes in the same period for the same reason. I also have a box that probably has 10 or more dead routers (or at least some of the ports have died or the wifi is fried) mostly for the same reason I suspect.

For those that don't know Florida leads the nation in lightning...

If you're going to have a dedicated sports channel you'll want decent video quality for it, which would take bandwidth away from the host channel.

Rising costs, bullshit fees, forcing us to use shitty boxes for every TV, ""$40"" turning in to $120 are pissing people off enough to get rid of cable in the first place.  But what really ought to terrify them is:

* A large percentage of people who get rid of cable find out they don't miss it.  At all.
* People who never had cable, particularly younger folks, have no desire to ever get cable.
",1532446728
cordcutters,"It’s hard to give you a concise answer without knowing what you watch, how much you watch, how quickly you want access to new episodes, etc.  

Let’s assume that you like to watch The Expanse, The Americans and Animal Kingdom.  Purchasing just the current season of each show would cost you between $20-30 per series. Add it all up, the $60-90 you’d spend is close to the cost of a full year of Amazon Prime.  Not coincidentally, all 3 of those shows stream exclusively on prime.  The big drawback is you may need to wait 6-12 months after the current season ends before they hit Prime.  

Purchasing outright gives you perpetual access to download and stream the show. But again, for similar dollars you could get those three shows and literally DOZENS of others via Prime. Prime, Hulu and Netflix will get you access to a LOT of shows.  And you don’t need to keep all of those subscriptions in force year-round. Subscribe to Prime for 2 months...binge as much as you wish...then cancel and move on to Netflix.  These days with so much exclusive content, you can easily add things like CBS All Access, HBO, Showtime and others to the rotation. 

Some shows aren’t available via streaming so you may be forced to buy to fill those gaps. There are websites and apps that will help you track discounts. For iTunes I use an app called Cheap Charts. But some patience is required.  It’s pretty rare to see a show go on sale as it begins airing new episodes. Season 3 of The Expanse was on sale for $20 this week.  It had been $30 since new episodes started airing back in March or April.

cordcutters,"**Robin Williams remembered in latest HBO doc on comics 'gone too soon'**

Programming note: Catch season 2 of the critically-acclaimed CNN Original Series ""History of Comedy

CNN tackles part of that in its latest iteration of the series ""History of Comedy,"" with an episode titled, appropriately, ""Gone Too Soon."" HBO, meanwhile, is taking another deep dive into the tortured recesses of comedic genius, as the network follows its four-hour look at Garry Shandling with ""Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind,"" an equally personal (if half as long) dissection of the comic/actor who tragically died by suicide in 2014.

In much the way that Judd Apatow used Shandling's diaries to provide insight, director Marina Zenovich (""Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired"") draws upon audio interviews with Williams, providing access to his innermost thoughts and recollections through his own accounts. That's augmented by interviews with those who were close to him, including Billy Crystal, Eric Idle, and relatively press-shy figures like David Letterman and Steve Martin.

The documentary is further enlivened by outtakes that demonstrate not just the astonishing agility of Williams' mind, but how he fed off that process, to the point where unusable portions of ""Mork &amp; Mindy"" tapings (including his profanity-laced riffs) were often way funnier than the show itself.

For students of television, it's also fascinating to hear about how Williams' improvisational style utterly flummoxed the cameramen working on the show, prompting producer Garry Marshall to add a fourth operator whose sole job was to follow the star at all times in order to catch his free-wheeling antics.

In what feels like a Hollywood cliché, Williams explosive success with that show brought with it all the attendant excesses, including philandering, drug use and the highs and lows associated with a huge hit, followed by the uncertainty of what comes next.

The biographical material here -- as articulated largely by Williams -- is also noteworthy, including his recollections about growing up lonely, attending an all-boys school, his first exposure to Jonathan Winters' madcap comedy on ""The Tonight Show"" and his attendance at Julliard, where his pals included ""Superman's"" Christopher Reeve.

Friends remember Williams as a ""force of nature,"" but also reflect sadness associated with his death, from Crystal discussing the silly phone messages Williams would leave him to ""Mork"" co-star Pam Dawber recalling seeing him as a shadow of himself near the end.

That energy -- and the rich body of work that Williams left behind -- magnifies the sense of loss, as it does with many of the performers mentioned (Williams among them) in ""History of Comedy.""

As Conan O'Brien notes in the ""Gone"" installment of the special, ""There's an intimacy to comedy, so that when they're gone, you miss it.""

Tinged with nostalgia and emotion, ""Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind"" conveys the messy complexities of the man, while serving as an unabashed celebration of his work.

By any measure, that's both a fitting tribute, and a contemplation of many layers that exist between the ebullient public personalities that fans see and the mass of contradictions and self-doubts that can lurk within. And yes, the trip inside Williams' mind is a reminder why such talents are missed long after they're gone, even by those who only knew them through the filter of a screen.

""Robin Williams: Come Inside My Mind"" premieres July 16 at 8 p.m. on HBO.

""History of Comedy"" returns on CNN July 15 at 10 p.m. Both networks are part of WarnerMedia.

Fox won alot of new broadcasting rights for Thursday nights so keep that in mind when looking at the guide (basically what CBS and NBC had last year). Amazon Prime still has its streaming rights for Thursday nights. The streaming rights are still likely to change before the start of the season as some services were just starting at the beginning of last season and recent mergers may affect what is offered.

Vue, Sling tv and Fubo TV have the Red zone and NFL Network (note the latter doesn't have games if Amazon etc have exclusive rights). Verizon Mobile no longer has exclusive Mobile rights which means that others can offer mobile viewing (example CBS All Access now also has mobile rights to its Sunday games).

There is Sunday Ticket version available online for those who can't put a satellite dish. It is in the NFL Guide. Uncertain if this will change this year but if you are trying replicate Sunday Ticket that is your closet option but it's pricy.

Only con I see with it so far is the average end user trying to use its software.  Philo doesn't have an iOS or Android app yet, so what you have to do is download the app for the network you are trying to view.  For example, we got Philo just to watch Drag Race, which premieres on the VH1 network.  So, download the VH1 app, sign into it using your Philo account, and then everything starts working just fine, including Chromecast connectivity.  Except for live TV.  I worked around this by logging into the VH1 website using my Philo account from my computer, starting live TV, and then casting that tab from Google Chrome.

After a couple months, I decided to try TV Choice again (I usually get a call every month from Spectrum asking me try TV Choice).  The UI was much better this time but the on-demand programming was annoying -- lots of commercials before the show even started and the commercials were a lot louder than the show.  So I cancelled again.  I actually signed up for TV Choice again yesterday due to the price increases for both Sling and DTVNow. Also, after a half year, I see that there are really not a lot of channels we actually watch. The on-demand volume issue is fine now and the number of commercials seems to have gone down, so maybe I'll stick with them this time!

In many cases, that loss must be made up with amplifiers (which gives you another point of failure).

In your case, with that antenna - you should have little problem with those stations if your cable hasn't degraded. 

If you replace that cable, you would be well advised to seek out a reputable US supplier like Belden (still many others). Asian stuff just varies too much. You'd need to be a water walker to sort it out.",1530541800

I have the longer wires at the top and bottom and the shorter ones in between, as in a bow-tie design.  I attached all to electrical conduit  pvc 10' poles (now 20' together) and attached to the back outside of the house extending just above the roof.  It works great for the 4 VHF channels and UHF.  It was an experiment that took several design tries and was actually fun and interesting.  If you're just after UHF, the star-like fractal shapes made from 9 inch wire should suffice.

cordcutters,"I think there will be upward pressure on pricing but OTA 3.0 will be coming into full swing, by then, and that will help hold pricing down.

I think that people who subscribe to multiple services (Netflix, Hulu, Prime, Sling, etc.) will pare things down, in response, and hop from service to service, more frequently.

I can see myself keeping Netflix, for a few months, then Hulu, etc.

OTA 3.0 will give us more subchannels along with our big local channels, as well as on-demand content.

And there will always be a new startup that will offer a skinnier bundle to attract cheapskates, like me.

cordcutters,"It’s clunky and a little risky.  

Most cell plans have hard caps on high speed hotspot data. T-Mobile One plans go down to 128k speeds after 10GB of hotspot usage. One Plus International is available for an extra $25 per month, providing “unlimited” hotspot tethering.  But that’s subject to deprioritization (Tmo reducing data speeds without warning during high traffic periods) after a certain threshold.  And those solutions require you to use your cell phone as a tethered hotspot, which puts stress on the phone. Run a hotspot for a couple hours and you’ll see how hot the device gets.  

Dedicated hotspots require their own service plan and typically have their own hard caps and deprioritization thresholds.

cordcutters,"An industry like this is strange. It's ISP-dependent, and since ISP's are basically monopolies, they should be highly regulated to be affordable to even the lowest economic class. Internet access is no longer a luxury; it's a necessity in the modern world.  


Streaming services, however, are free market driven because multiple competitors use the web the way networks use the air waves.  Since OTA broadcasting is free and paid for by advertising, there's no skipping commercials without a smart DVR, and those come with a built-in premium anyway. Vue comes with a decent cloud DVR that let's you FF thru commercials. They could do what Hulu does and make that a premium function, and let the CUSTOMER choose to pay extra for that, or pay less and live with the ads. Personally, I can live with ads in news shows, but prefer movies and other fictional TV stories not be interrupted. Happy to pay a bit more to remove the ads. NOT happy to get the bait and switch BS of what appears to be a solid value taken away with two unjustified price hikes in under two years.  


As long as my ISP values my regular payment for a decent connection enough not to try to take me to the cleaners, I'm okay with that service. But Vue has no monopoly as a live streaming service. They have LOADS of competition, yet think they are a monopoly somehow and that I somehow NEED those few paltry channels that I can get from others just as clearly, and quite possibly now for less. The truth is I don't need ANY of what they offer. It's really a small LUXURY to have access to watching ""Walking Dead"" or ""Mr. Robot"" or ""House Hunters"" the moment they air on cable versus waiting for them to show up on Netflix, Prime, or even Hulu. And Prime and Netflix have taught us the Joy of Binge-Watching over the past year, so  frankly I'd much rather wait for Mr. Robot to be cancelled and appear on Prime all at once than wait for weekly episodes anyway.  


And if the rest of you cord cutters realized the actual POWER you have, that WE have as a collective consumer base, by simply REFUSING to accept these constant fee hikes, they would stop doing them by making the hard choices necessary to stay in business. Hard choices like smaller executive bonuses, or God forbid, NO bonuses at all! Imagine those jerks actually being satisfied with just the luxury of a steady monthly paycheck. What a concept! Trust me, friends, they only do this because WE put up with it and keep paying them for something we can easily live WITHOUT. If we all unsubscribed in a huge wave, they'd adjust those fees back down to what we signed on for in short order, and pay for it by losing a lot of unnecessary dead weight in their executive ranks. It's Business 101 to charge ""what the market will bear."" So STOP BEARING IT unless you like paying ever higher fees for the same BS product. It's the only power we have. USE. IT.",1530661167

Most of the antennas I built couldn't get it with shorter wires.  Read up a little on tv frequencies and the wavelengths for the channels around you.  Your wires should be 1/4 the full length of the frequency.  I.e., for MeTv channel 3 frequency length is 16', so my wires for that are 4'.  This also helps for VHF 7, 11 and 13.  UHF lengths are shorter, and generally 18"" wires will receive most of them.  I tried various lengths and with the 18"" only I couldn't get 3, 11 and 13, but got all the others.  I finally did some research and hit on 2 4' wires and 3 18"" wires.  My design is like the 2 and 3-bay hanger wire antenna designs you can find easily, except I have the 4' wires on the top bay and bottom bay and the shorter wires in 3 bays in between them.

You would say my 18mbps mpeg2 recording is better quality than the same thing transcoded to h264 at 9mbps but that is not often the case in my experience.

It also depends on content. Anime/cartoons compress really well whereas fast action/sports need a higher bitrate.

cordcutters,"I think they were saying it was Comcast making a play for Hulu, not Disney. Hulu is partially owned by NBC, Fox, and ABC. Disney absolutely has the leverage to make a good streaming platform, but a Universal/Comcast/NBC only streaming service wouldn't compete with what Hulu currently is. However, if Comcast had bought 21st, it would have gotten ahold of another 1/3rd of the Hulu pie and it could maintain a decent service if and when Disney bowed out of Hulu to focus on their own streaming service.  


I'm very interested to see how things shake out for Hulu with this whole deal.",1532027379
cordcutters,"Yes, those a la carte premium services (HBO, Showtime, Starz) are pretty much safe from the decline of traditional cable TV because all of them are now hybrid services that can be accessed via either traditional cable or via OTT. HBO was first to do that with the launch of HBO Now in spring 2015 and Showtime followed a couple of months later, then Starz several months after that. Epix (the smallest and newest premium cable service) has said they plan to finally move to a hybrid model too, allowing for direct OTT subscriptions, although no date has been set when that will happen.",1531929069
cordcutters,"GoT only became an international sensation because of the weekly releases. It allowed the story to build, speculation to run rampant on the next episode, and drove folks to have viewing parties for the next episode. The hype train takes time to leave the station and anticipation drives fans crazy. Until the past year, it also allowed for no spoilers until it started airing. Drop all of that online on one day and while I'd be happy, it would also kill viewing parties and all the build up/hype towards the season/series finale. I'd take the day off work, binge all of it, and then partake in a season discussion online that would likely last a week at best. Name another streaming service that has a title like a  Westworld or GoT that drives viewership and creates an online community. Stranger Things would be that I think IF they had weekly releases. It's hard to have that vaunted water cooler discussion during the week where you get other folks interested if you've already binged the season in a day. Shit, I got my entire crew at work into The Expanse this past season because it aired weekly. One person finally caved, binged it all, and we talked it up. Before the end of the season, 4 others climbed on board.

I still feel like Netflix is going to have to figure out what their prestige titles are and do weekly releases for that reason. ",1531497218

I was in a similar boat and had installed a window mount antenna but needed to provide a signal to TVs scattered throughout the house that were in rooms away from the broadcasting tower, so had no options for stand alones. I asked if people thought it would work and got mixed results with most people saying no or that the antenna could only handle one TV.

I ended up just giving it a shot, hooking it into an amplified two-way splitter, with one feed going to my Roamio OTA and the other going into the wall, which in turn went into a 7-way splitter and out into all the wall jacks. Hooked up an HDHR, another Tivo and another TV to it. Works perfectly. Signal strength is obviously weaker, but good enough for me being ~25 miles away from the three towers.",1531004228
cordcutters,"Since WCBI-TV (CBS 4.1) is the closest station to you and should have a good signal, you probably have one of two problems.

1. Multipath reception. UHF digital TV signals are sensitive to reflections causing two signals that interact at your antenna. Even trees can cause reflections and they often change with wind and weather. Your present antenna should be pretty good at rejecting multipath if correctly aimed. This type of antenna has a fairly wide beam width, but it also has ""nulls"" along the sides. You should try sweeping it over a full 90º with the idea of getting a strong direct signal but also dropping the reflected signals into one of the nulls. It's possible you may need to use a yagi-style antenna like [this one](https://www.channelmaster.com/Digital_HDTV_Outdoor_TV_Antenna_p/cm-2020.htm) that has a narrower beam and deeper nulls. 

2. If you are using an amplifier with this antenna, it might help to try it without the amplifier. Sometimes an amplifer can be slightly overloaded and since WCBI-TV should be your strongest station, that's a possibility. 

Hope this helps!

cordcutters,"One of the few good things that Comcast does right is the portion of their website that shows compatable modems.

If your provider is using the DOCSIS standard... if it comes from the pole as coax and isn't fiber based, it probably is... it's probably DOCSIS. You'll want a modem that does either 3.0 or 3.1. There are other things that make one modem better than others. If you're paying for speeds above about 50 Mbps, these features are important. Google is your friend.

IF... you have a modem/router combination, you'll need to either replace it with another combo or preferably get a separate router.

r/HomeNetworking had some links on the old style reddit screen that you could find indepth discussions on both modems and routers.

I paid $50 for my modem at Costco. At Comcast's $5.99 rental, it'll be paid for in less than ten months. I already had a decent router.

In edit... If you're on fiber all the way, (think Fios) it's a different scenario. The ""modem"" is actually the ONT, which is the box that the cable from the pole plugs in to. Verizon didn't charge me for that but they did charge for a router. From a consumer's standpoint, there's no value in trying to replace their equipment with yours... on the wall.

When I dropped the cable TV portion of my service, I didn't need their shitty router anymore (and, if you want to do some geek level work, you really don't need it even if you have TV service. Again, Google is your friend.) I ran an ethernet cable from the ONT to my router, called Tech Support and had them switch the ONT from coax to ethernet. It takes less than five minutes.",1531056820

Star Trek, Frasier, things like that. It seems there are fewer and fewer of them in the offing now. It may well be the studios’ fault, but it doesn’t make it any less unfortunate.

I do wish Prime v/s paid was more separated, but I actually like the fact that I can rent more current movies within the same app easily as Amazon already has all my payment info anyway.

...then they pulled MacGuyver... and a bunch of other stuff, and started focusing on Original Content. I like a fair amount of that, but it's still a loss -- there was a golden window where it seemed like anyone who had a library full of IP and wanted to get into this streaming thing just licensed to Netflix. Now, those same libraries full of IP are either moving to their own streaming platforms, or just getting pulled entirely as Netflix focuses on paying for original content.

cordcutters,"From most of the crowd on here, you'd think DTVN stole their car and wrecked it.  For many users that DTVN has, it's fine.  It has flaws.  Let's be clear on that.  The UI is inconsistent between devices (ATV version doesn't wrap the guide around, Amazon FireTV does), the DVR can be shit as it's in beta.  In the end, those things didn't matter to me.  It has the channel lineup, the picture quality at 60fps, and overall the service has been great for me on my ATV and FireTV devices as well as my iPad.

Your mileage will vary.  That's why all the trials.  Don't go looking for validation from people here, figure out what works best for you, spend the money YOU think it is worth.  If the channel lineup for $40/mo on DTVN works, and you adjust to the UI for example, then good!  People will complain and tell you how awful a service is but are less likely to say ""it's good"" and those that do get shouted out by those that hate it.  Just give each one a spin, if it fits your need, awesome.  If not, that's the beauty of the OTT services, you can try something for a month and bail with little change cost. 

Oh, one last thing.  The happy wife, happy life principle.  Sometimes getting the best deal isn't worth having to learn new things all the time.  I obviously don't know if that's your scenario, but something to think about as well.

Or those that live in rural areas in which they are unable to get Internet without a ridiculous datacap (i.e. HughesNet) and without cellular coverage. 

Luckily, I do have one internet provider where I live that I can get DSL from. However, I have no cellular coverage at my house. I have friends that do not have any ISP's offering DSL/Cable, and for years, they have been stuck with satellite internet (with crazy data caps) and no cellular coverage. 

Part of the problem is in many areas, homes are ridiculously under serviced when it comes to cellular coverage and Internet (unless you are forced to go with crappy satellite internet). It's great reading how certain providers are offering 5G coverage - but it's always in areas that already have 4G/LTE coverage, or other options for Internet. Meanwhile, those in rural areas are continuing to be neglected.

cordcutters,"Right now, there are probably around 90 million households paying for cable/satellite/streaming.  Let’s assume all of them have AMC as part of their base package.  Same company also owns WE, Sundance, BBC America, IFC and others.  Figure they’re probably getting around $1.50 per month for all of those channels...that’s $135 million per month.  

If AMC introduces a stand-alone streaming product, the risk is that cable companies will stop carrying all of those channels.  When renegotiations occur, rather than agreeing to pay $1.50....$2.00....$2.50 for every single subscriber, the cable/sat/streaming company drops them all to keep costs down and tells consumers “if you really want AMC, go pay $5 for it.”  

Just to maintain those monthly revenues of $135M, AMC needs to convince nearly 30 million people to pay $5 per month...every single month...not just those handful of months when they’re showing new episodes of Walking dead or Saul.  

It’s not a viable business model.  And THAT is why networks are reluctant to offer themselves on an a la carte basis.  ESPN+ is the same...a supplement to the existing ESPN networks.  Disney’s forthcoming streaming service will be the same...it won’t have everything from Disney Channel, and will have its own exclusive content.  Networks are trying to double-dip from their die hard fans.",1530505960
cordcutters,"Here’s my personal take on this write up:

1. Interface - While the author took a few nonspecific pot shots at the evils of cable interfaces, streaming interfaces were never even addressed.  What’s so great about Directv Now?  Or Hulu Live TV?  Or Sling?  I’m a fan of YouTube TV’s software, and frankly that’s the only one I would promote as being better than cable. I don’t see anything about DTVN or Sling that puts it above a run-of-the-mill cable program guide. 

2. Channels - You can always tell when someone who is not a sports of news watcher writes one of these stories. Sports is very much schedule-driven, as is news programming on a dozen different channels ranging from CNN to MSNBC to Weather Channel. Same for talk shows / morning shows, though we could lump most of those in with news. 

Channels also remain seemingly the most effective way of organizing content, a method which still seems to escape the likes of Netflix and Prime. Generally speaking, people know what they’re going to find on ESPN vs Fox News vs Disney Channel vs HGTV vs Lifetime. Trying to find content similarly organized on an OTT service is still very, very frustrating. 

3. Commercials - here’s the thing: like it or not, commercials are still part of the economics of TV production. Back when The Expanse was cancelled by SyFy, the producers and creators were pretty clear about what was going on. SyFy funded the production and relied on the live, Live+3, Live+7 day ratings to prove its worth to advertisers. Monthly subscriber fees for SyFy aren’t enough—they need the ad revenue from advertisers too.  Amazon Prime picked up seasons 1 &amp; 2–commercial free—about a year after the initial broadcast. But without SyFy paying the bill in the first place, The Expanse doesn’t get made. 

Amazon eventually “rescued” the show and will now fully fund production. But again, without SyFy, the show was never on the air in the first place. 

Follow this thru to dozens of other shows which aren’t Netflix or Prime exclusives: Breaking Bad, Walking Dead, The Office, The Americans, Family Guy, Futurama, etc. Sure it’s great to have those shows on a commercial-free platform to binge. But without broadcast &amp; cable networks paying the original production costs, those shows don’t get made.  

Without commercial-funded TV, either we’re paying a lot more up front for content or networks produce less or networks go out of business because they can’t find enough paying customers. Probably a combination of all of these. Everyone likes to think that THEIR favorite shows would be OK and other “garbage” would disappear. But that’s not realistic. Timeless, The Expanse, Last Man on Earth, Lucifer, Designated Survivor, Colony....just a few recent shows that seemingly had rabid followings but their original networks couldn’t justify continued funding.",1532889071

The router, on the other hand, is usually garbage. So, you'll still see a big improvement if you just add a standalone.

Local laws may influence ISPs ability to build out, but aside from that there’s nothing directly preventing another ISP from entering the market. Problem is it’s expensive to lay new cable and there’s no guarantee on the ROI.  Imagine an ISP spends $50K to wire a neighborhood with 100 houses.  What if only 10 houses switch over?  It could take them a decade just to break even on the cost of laying that cable. 

Meanwhile wireless services are set to challenge traditional wired internet within the next couple of years. This theoretical new ISP will never make back the cost of laying their cable if, by 2022, people are running their homes off 5G wireless from AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. 

Your ISP can charge whatever they wish. Maybe someone can offer tips for getting a new customer rate, but they have no obligation to offer you a discount.

Maybe not Blockbuster video kaput, but something similar. ",1533058767
cordcutters,"&gt;News, though? Youtube, of all things, does a reasonable job of surfacing news I might be interested in while it's still relevant. HBO has Last Week Tonight, which is still going to be relevant if I watch it Monday morning instead of Sunday night.

Last Week Tonight is entertainment as much as it is programming. Most people who voraciously consume news programming--even stuff like Hannity or Anderson Cooper--don't want time delayed snippets posted to social media. People watch live news for a variety of reasons ranging from business/work related to a personal desire to stay informed. Agree or disagree with the philosophy, Fox News is still the highest rated cable network. 

&gt;And generally speaking, people know what they're going to find in the ""similar to"" suggestions when looking up a Disney movie on Netflix

Except that Netflix has its own agenda to keep pushing you toward their ""latest and greatest"" exclusive content, regardless of how it crosses genre barriers. Admittedly, this doesn't make Netflix much different than one of the Big 4 networks given the variety of content available. If I'm watching an episode of NCIS on CBS, I may see an ad for The Big Bang Theory (comedy) or Colbert (talk.) 

What I'm referring to are the more specialized networks like Food Network, HGTV, Travel, CNN, ESPN, Lifetime, Hallmark, etc. Netflix, Hulu and Prime have yet to provide an effective means for drilling down to the type of specific programming those channels would typically offer in their lineup.   

&gt;And Game of Thrones is probably the most expensive show ever made, yet even on broadcast TV, it's shown without commercial breaks. 

HBO charges $15 per month. Netflix is $12 per month. Prime is $13. Showtime is $11.  CBS All access $10. 

HBO airs about 8-10 hours of original scripted programming per month (Sunday 9-11pm) plus a few hours of talk and sports and movies that are a anywhere from 1-30 years old. I like Game of Thrones as much as the next guy but I'm not entirely sure how they continue to command such a premium in this marketplace. 

Could AMC be successful charging $10-15 per month commercial-free for The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, Preacher and a handful of others?  How about FX for Legion, Atlanta, Baskets and Archer? 

&gt;...I mean, to put a number on it, Facebook barely makes more than $2/mo/user. We're living in a weird dystopia where every aspect of our private lives is mined just to get us to click on ads, all to save us less than it would cost to go to the movies twice a year. I just don't buy that removing ads would either kill a ton of shows, or raise subscription prices enough to matter.

[This Forbes story](https://www.forbes.com/sites/danafeldman/2018/03/28/u-s-tv-ad-spend-drops-as-digital-ad-spend-climbs-to-107b-in-2018/#77969dfe7aa6) details projected commercial spending in 2018. It's estimated at $69.8 billion for tv and $107.3B for digital ads (Hulu, ads in network apps, etc.) That's over $177 BILLION in revenue for ad-supported media. There are over 100 million households in the US.  Let's generously round that up to 120 million. To generate the same $177 billion in revenues on an ad-free basis, **households would have to fork over an average of $1475 each per year or $123 per month**.  On top of what they are already paying in cable/streaming fees.  

Remember there are tens-of-millions of consumers who pay NOTHING for OTA tv from the broadcast networks. In lieu of subscriber fees, the primary source of revenue for CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox, CW, sub channels and independents is advertising. Those ads cover billions of dollars in production costs and licensing fees (NFL, NCAA basketball tourney, NBA playoffs, College Football, etc.)

From there, the math is simple. If you're eliminating ad revenue and viewers aren't willing to pay a significant portion of production costs, programming budgets get smaller and networks go away. ",1532919741

cordcutters,"I don't know which service will play best on Fire Sticks, as I prefer set top boxes....so my answers are based on that (I have a Roku, FireTV 4k, and 2 Apple TV's)

DirecTV Now on a powerful unit like the AppleTV is, in my opinion, the best service out there. It has the best channel line-up and the picture quality is superb. It also has The Weather Channel, which the others do not. TWC is one of my favorites, 

My second favorite is YouTube TV, but it is missing a lot of my favorite channels (TWC, Travel Channel, Food Network). A lot of people add a second service, Philo, to pick up some of the channels missing from YTTV. So you can tack 16 bucks on top of the price as well as the inconvenience of having to switch back and forth. I also hate being forced to use my Google account for it.

Vue would be my third choice. Still missing a lot of channels, but not as many as YTTV. My big thing against Vue is that I hate the guide and I refuse to have to use to my PSN account for billing anymore due to all the hacks they encounter.

Sling TV only has 2 of my locals, and the picture quality is the worst out there, and by the time you get done adding in packages, they become one of the most expensive services. I do like their guide though.

cordcutters,"YouTube TV + Philo or Vue + Channels.  Both are high quality options. 

I used Channels for a few months.  It was OK.  Annoyed me that some of our Apple devices would randomly lose contact with the HD Homerun and not reconnect on their own. Out of home streaming was similarly glitchy; I’d set it up, it would work OK for a while and then randomly stop working. 

YTTV has all of my locals, it streams perfectly well on iPhones and iPads outside the home, and the DVR works great. The only drawback is the DVR/VOD thing but other services all had greater problems or missing features of their own.",1532382511
cordcutters,"I've at least played with all four.  Here's my take:
(tl;dr: TiVo or Tablo depending on your household)

* **TiVo** This is what I use primarily today, but only because I bought it years ago and it has a high spousal-acceptance-factor.  The Roamio OTA is great, but expensive ($400).  It works as a whole house DVR if you put Tivo Minis ($175) on the other TVs.  Most familiar for anybody coming from the cable world.  They were the hands-down best option for an OTA DVR for many years, but have gotten fairly stagnant.  The hardware is old and underpowered, the streaming app platform is terrible, and the company doesn't seem all that interested in innovating any more.  Great if you just want a familiar DVR experience, but they honestly cost about double what they ought to.

* **Tablo** - The best choice if you've got Rokus/Fire Sticks/etc. laying around.  If your household is fine using a smart-tv/streaming device for something like SlingTV, DirecTV Now, PS Vue and can pry them away from the cable-only channels, this is probably the best choice.  It's what I would recommend to most people.  If my Tivo died today, it's what I would buy.

* **Plex** - Lots of potential, but still a bit of a work in progress.  You have to get all the pieces together yourself.  Very DIY and you really need to already have most of the pieces to do it for a reasonable cost (decent PC that stays on most of the time or NVidia Shield, hard drive space, compatible tuner(s)).  Cannot schedule recordings in all apps on all devices, but they're working on it.  No grid guide aside from the Web UI, but they're working on it.

* **Channel Master Stream+** - Not in the same league as the others. Requires an external hard drive for the DVR features.  It's cheap ($150) but there is nothing that it offers that can't be found elsewhere done much better. (Tablo, NVidia Shield, FireTV, etc.)",1532628991

I was willing to let its issues slide since their price to channel ratio was petty good, but this hurts that positive a lot.

If you have 2 people streaming 4K movies or shows you need at least 30mbps, but you want some headroom, so you double the speed needed to 60mbps. Then if you like most people now days have a few other devices online while watching TV, 100mbps isn't really roadkill anymore.

The further away you are from the box, the ""slower"" the speed/bandwidth becomes due to the very nature of DSL technology. Cable internet does not have the same issue.

Let me put it to you this way...if I had the choice between 100MBs cable and 100MBs DSL for the same price, then I would go with the cable option 100% of the time without hesitation.

Broadcast TV since the transition to digital is required to send some guide information with the channel you are viewing.  This can be as little as a few hours up to several days.  Most ATSC devices &amp; TVs have an ability to organize this information from all your scanned OTA channels into a guide.   

Not so with Cable's QAM.  Typically their complete guide info is transmitted on a separate non-picture channel and you will need a set top box to receive &amp; decode it.   ",1530734313

If Sinclair started distributing cable channels over the air WITHOUT spying (zero internet connection)- we'd go for it. Less troublesome than any streaming platform.

cordcutters,"You need to be willing and ready to cancel your services as soon as you pick up the phone to talk to them. As soon as you know that you are strong enough to not blink while you pull the trigger and say ""I will not pay that much, cancel my services"" you can get better prices. If you cancel your services, you can re-sign up and get new customer pricing, but what's more likely to occur is the people on the phone will transfer you to someone in the ""customer retention"" department. 

Those people CAN offer you better prices. You just have to be committed to getting what you want and not falling for any gimmicks like buying more services so the thing you want is technically cheaper, but the bill's still about the same since you got conned into a home security system or some other crap you didn't want. 

I was paying Comcast (I'm in Houston, too) about $78/mo for just internet when one day I got a notice in the mail saying my bill was going up and what the ""normal"" rates for service were. Upon closer inspection, I saw that the new ""normal"" price for the internet package was *lower* than what I was already paying. I called them up to bitch about the price and was very firm about just wanting to pay the ""normal"" price. It was the weirdest shit. For whatever reason they could not give me the ""normal"" price for this service. They tried all the tricks, too, trying to get me to sign up for TV, Phone, etc., but I wasn't having it. 

I was insistent on just paying what *they* told me *in writing* was the ""normal"" (not a promo) price for the service I was receiving. The rep pretended that they couldn't do anything until I was like, ""Screw this; I want to cancel my services."" They put me on hold then transferred me to the customer retention department and I laid my case out as to why I was cancelling my services and how I felt they were not operating above board by disallowing me to even get what was deemed the ""normal"" price for the service. Eventually I beat them down, and now my monthly bill for the same internet service is $48/month.

One commercial at the start and another one at the end of a show.

HBO Go works well on my Rokus. No issues for me. Bugs sound more like an app related issue, than platform issue.

Sports channels would encapsulate the range of channels too. So $3-$3.50 would buy you Bein Sports 1 thru 10 and TVE access for example.

Personally I like premiums too. So I'd still pay $5-10 per month for HBO, Starz, Cinemax and Showtime on rotation. This is because bundled channels like FX for example, always censor and reformat their movie selection. Waste of time and money. Buy a premium channel and/or Hulu, Netflix, Prime etc.

cordcutters,"&gt; live TV streaming services aren't in danger of becoming a worse deal than cable or satellite TV. Even after the current wave of price hikes, live TV streaming services are generally much cheaper than the average traditional TV bill. For packages that include major broadcast networks, regional and national sports coverage, and major news networks, the price for live TV streaming still floats around $40 to $50 per month. That's less than half the average $106 that U.S. homes spent on traditional TV service last year, 

This is the most important aspect of this topic. Sure you can complain about paying an additional $5/month but it’s still much better and, oftentimes, significantly cheaper than what you’d pay a cable or sat company. Plus some of the streaming services have more advanced features than traditional cable making them more appealing. ",1530801410

cordcutters,"So I found some info from the FCC:

&gt; Q:  If I live in a condominium, cooperative, or other type of residence where certain areas have been designated as ""common,"" do these rules apply to me?

&gt; A:  The rules apply to residents of these types of buildings, but the rules do not permit you to install an antenna on a common area, such as a walkway, hallway, community garden, exterior wall or the roof.  However, you may install the antenna wholly within a balcony, deck, patio, or other area where you have exclusive use.

&gt; Drilling through an exterior wall, e.g. to run the cable from the patio into the unit, is generally not within the protection of the rule because the exterior wall is generally a common element.  You may wish to check with your retailer or installer for advice on how to install the antenna without drilling a hole.  Alternatively, your landlord or association may grant permission for you to drill such a hole.  The Commission's rules generally do not cover installations if you drill through a common element.

My patio closet has one side that is connected to my living room. I can drill a hole and it will come out next to a bookcase in my living room. What I don't know is if this is considered ""exterior wall"" even though its INSIDE the closet and not a wall you can see. The wall is actually just the backside of the living room wall.

The general rule is that 720p tends to work better for high action content (sports being the number one thing, which is why FOX and ABC stick to it more often than not), while 1080i is better for movies (interlacing is pretty hard to notice at a low frame rate) and content that is high frame rate but lacks a lot of movement (the news, soap operas).",1531494368

Cox should have a compatibility list for your connection speed. You'll see the term DOCSIS, which is the protocol they all use. The latest is 3.1, but 3.0 is still acceptable. Choosing anything on their compatibility list will be fine.

Disney doesn't need Hulu, and it wasn't why they bought Fox. The only unique things Hulu has for Disney is an existing subscriber base, some originals, and licenses from competitors that probably won't last into the future.

Back in the 90's, when I turned my grandma's aerial to Lewiston ID, (26 miles south), and turned the channel scan mode to ""CABLE"", I'd pick up the cable feed because somebody was transmitting the entire feed.  I loved it when I was a kid. :)  It was staticky, but it was cable TV.",1531716145

Regardless if you go with plex or not, you need a some sort of computer+storage device to store your recordings.

No one could argue that the convenience and price are far superior with the current options but it's missing something.

cordcutters,"That could be possible. Though usually they wouldn't quote you such a high speed if they couldn't service that area properly. Call the provider, give them the address and ask what service they can *guarantee*. If they quote you something under 4Mbps, it probably isn't gonna be a reliable service.

If DSL is a flop I'd recommend looking into your cellular options. Check the coverage in the area with the major cell providers, maybe ask the neighbors what they use for their phones, and look into what home internet services you can get that way. You might get a cap, or a ""throttle when busy"" unlimited plan, but that's way better than the service you'd get with satellite at the same prices. Satellite has longer latency, and these days often impose even stricter throttling on things like video, than comparable cell plans. 

Somebody told me about http://4gdata.net which has unlimited plans on all 4 major networks. It isn't cheap compared to wired connections, but if you need unlimited data it's worth a look. Their Sprint plan is the cheapest at $70, and would probably be worth it if there's coverage at your new home.",1531499462

We can use technology to stretch it's usage but we'll forever keep hitting the top and pinging off of it as more people come online and demand more bandwidth out of their service.  This will be met by slowing individual users down and other ways to limit their usage.

Satellite?  even LEO Satellite?  Latency.  That kills the web, and the gamer.  Once you're over a certain Mb/s latency hurts more.

We can just keep laying more fiber.  Forever, well, within some practical/space limitations but future tech has enough bandwidth down a single piece of fiber to run today's entire Internet over it.  Run a fiber with a dozen strands and call it a day.  It's not practically going to run out any time soon.  Laying fiber is expensive vs. throwing up a radio tower, but it's also a one time investment per property, with minor amounts of upkeep.  Houses with good Internet already sell for more today, if you're building/buying a house in 2018 you make sure that's available even if you have to pay more up front.  Switching out the equipment at each end every few years for speed upgrades is relatively cheap, and it doesn't rely on the local power utility to keep working because it's a straight run back to the CO/POP which has lovely big generators attached to it, more than you'll find at any given wireless tower.

Two tips for Vue:

1. If you did DVR a show, you can choose to watch the DVR version or the On-demand version (if available). I believe the OD version has better quality, but comes with commercials and limited FF capability. I've never had an issue with the upscaled DVR version on my 4K TV.
2. I've had trouble starting the DVR version of a show from the live version. I can trigger it by changing the channel to something else, and then selecting the show in the DVR. I will try the ""start over"" next time (thanks for the tip).",1531238391
cordcutters,"&gt;  I'd prefer to put it on the opposite side of my house from my driveway (which could be blocked partially by my second chimney).

I'm not sure what the layout of your house is. So just be sure that the side of the house you're considering offers a clear view to 212 degrees (south-southeast).  If anything blocks the view, that will harm your reception.

&gt; I'm just going to drill through the brick and place a coax plate wherever I install.

In case you don't want to drill, you can also see if there are spare, unused runs of coaxial cable from the cable company demarcation point (box or in-wall or in-ground, on the side of your house) to your wiring panel.  You can simply plug your antenna coaxial lead into that spare run, being sure to use a grounding block like the TII-212.  That grounding block needs its own ground wire to the electrical service enclosure.",1531015694
cordcutters,"A few things... these cable companies offer speeds “up to” for residential subscribers. So they will tell you that you are getting the speeds they promise you as long as you are between 1-60Mbps. The only customers they guarantee a speed is business class customers. For instance I had Xfinity and my speeds were always up and down. That is because you share a pipe with your neighbors. The more neighbors using that service the more bandwidth to share and Comcast is slow to upgrade neighborhoods. When I switched to Comcast Business class in the same neighborhood all of a sudden my service was prioritized and I got the 150Mbps all of the time and it never wavered. 

The other thing they will tell you is that they are only responsible for the speeds within their own network. So if you try a speed test that isn’t on their server they won’t recognize that. They are only responsible for their network so they will usually want you to use their speed test on their website. 

Edit: call them and tell them your router is flaming out and you want a truck roll. . When the tech is there explain the slow downs and ask them to check your copper. Charter techs use a JDSU HST-3000 tester and they will be able to see if they need to run new copper at you house. When I moved to a Charter area and they came to install I had the tech run some test. He ended up rewriting my house. ",1530920306

Even though I'm connecting to the same switch at 1Gbps it's small files, it's no problem. It's not even an issue if someone else connects to the same server. And we're streaming some audio and video and it's catching up. But now 3-4 roommates in the house are connecting and they all want 4k video, now we've got a problem I need a bigger pipe to the server.  (actually, I didn't do the math on this so maybe I need 10-20 roommates for this example?)


In this case, it's a one-time cost to do that but I'm trying to be analogous to the internet, but I've got a few roommates who don't need the faster connection, do I pass the cost on to everyone or do I charge the people who use more data? (yes, we could make this about bandwidth, but the analogy got away from me). The newer infrastucture is for them, everyone is going to use the same faster infrastructure, but it makes no difference to my mom if that facebooks is coming down at 10Mbps or 1000Mbps.

I hate that it's just getting to the point where it's cheaper to go with the ISP provider than the streaming options already.

If you have an attic just use an attic antenna -OR- you probably have vents of some sort you can feed the coax through into the attic and then drop the coax (dropping between walls sucks but can be done, in the alternative drop it into a closet and then can pass through the wall or use a device to distribute by wifi).

  
If it is pier and beam construction you likely have vents, run the coax through the vent (which is what I do from my roof mounted antenna) then bring it through the floor.

If the house has previously been wired for cable or satellite, just connect the antenna to the existing coax.  
",1531108677
cordcutters,"Wow. That's a solid antenna. No reason it shouldn't pickup ABC. Why isn't CBS, NBC, PBS affected? Have you ruled out your television by substituting with another receiver?

Any chance water might have entered your cable?

Equipment to verify water ingress is expensive, nearly always cheaper just to replace cable. And yes, you just need a grounding block, a ground rod and grounding cable.

Another more esoteric consideration....is it possible you are getting multipath signal for ABC? The reflection could cancel out your desired signal. This is hard to isolate and I confess I can't identify the symptoms with ATSC signals. ",1530492500

I don’t use the DVR, not cause it’s bad or buggy, I just learned I don’t need it. I tend to find all my content on demand through the network apps.

cordcutters,"My only complaint with it is just that is is SO far off my radar on any shit I would possibly be ever interested in watching, that it’s genuinely annoying to have that presented to me in the screen saver they have now. 

For ten years Netflix had me “figured out” and would only show stuff that I would be interested in watching. 

But now it shows me every piece of garbage that is a Netflix original, whether I would be interested in it or not. Gone are the days of being a targeted profile, they just cram every piece of crap on your screen whether you like it or not. 

Not impressed. Netflix just keeps getting worse. ",1532838439
cordcutters,"No help, I too cannot put one up at home in general but even if I could it would not help. 

I had one put up for the boss outside on a pole at my last job as he wanted OTA tv in his office and no joy, still got nothing other than the two. Some days you could almost get others, but they’d glitch and digitize and not come in at all other days. He had basic cable installed. I just stream everything, 700 Gb worth last month actually.

If I moved about thirty miles North I’d have a decent shot but this whole city of 140,000 cannot get OTA TV. Maybe a few lucky people in the high spots or top levels of apartment buildings?",1532465556
cordcutters,"Oh I have tried, it’s always something. Wrong modem(even though it’s from their list), their system is down and can’t make the activation, can’t see the modem, wrong cabling in house and I’ll need a tech visit to change it all out, I don’t have permissions in the account to make that change, need a supervisor approval to make the change, have to return their modem before that can make the change, and my personal favorite...the new modem is leaking internet and would cause an outage in the neighborhood.
It’s just delaying tactics to get you to give up and the $10 a month is not worth my time fighting anymore.",1531489613
cordcutters,"Try it with a flat coax under the patio door before drilling a hole to see if it's really worth the risk. That's what I'm doing and I find that the improvements are minimal, compared to an indoor antenna. YMMV.

In my old condo, I often found it more practical to just move forward with something nobody would notice, rather than ask permission. Asking permission always resulted in way more red tape than should be necessary, and often ended in rejection. Sometimes easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. But if your HOA has a strict fine/penalty structure in place, of course you'd want to take that into consideration.",1531105855
cordcutters,"Won’t go into the fees n local taxes n rental $ that come with cable. But we have to remember that att is the owner of satellite Directv and the only isp in some areas. They are not going to cannibalize their satellite business without making up the shortfall. Dish owns Sling. Enough said. I always thought of Sony Vue as the outsider but they will not take a loss or invest much more in advertising with PlayStation Video Consoles n games being their bread n butter. Google, IMO, will stay at a decent price. The data they are collecting on YouTube tv subscribers is invaluable to them as they are in the human data business.",1530653651
cordcutters,"Yeah, I have to vouch for YouTube TV as well.  It's what I ultimately switched to after getting frustrated with Playstation Vue late last year, and I'm very happy with it.

The big caveat to YouTube TV is that most of the large networks upload VOD versions of their shows less than 24 hours after they air, and then you only have the option of watching the VOD version with unskippable ads instead of the DVR version.  That's a dealbreaker for some folks.

But what I like about YouTube TV is that everything you record is guaranteed to be available for 9 months in at least one of these formats.  I also love the interface, which separates TV, movies, sports and special events, which is extremely important to me as Vue was always a cluttered mess.

In a situation where Vue and YouTube TV were the same price for me, YouTube TV would still be the clear choice at this point in time.",1530815093

cordcutters,Cant say how vue operates on Fire Stick. The reason I went with Roku (my son has a fire stick) is 2 reasons. 1) I didn't like how it tries to integrate all apps / shows etc into the Amazon interface. 2) I didn't want to get involved with either an apple or Google or Amazon product because sometimes those companies get territorial and block apps that are available on roku.,1531789157
cordcutters,"I'm a bit ignorant, but I'll tell you what my husband did--he handles the physical connections, I make it all work.

He plugged in all devices to the receiver, the receiver to the tv.  The Apple TV has a separate connection to the tv.  The universal remote (reflecting the tv's inputs) has the tv/dvd players/stereo on one input, the apple tv on another, for sound at least.",1530568067

cordcutters,"If you have kids, Netflix is great. I also really question your 2 weeks of watchable content assertion. That being said, it’s a completely reasonable thing to sub in and out especially if you’re single or you and your significant other are in sync. But even if you only use it a handful of times a month, the monthly rate is really reasonable... despite the price hikes.",1530422726
cordcutters,"Sounds like you've already started the trial...good decision.   I'd rate it as the second best of all the live streaming services behind PS Vue and we've tried them all but Hulu so far.   Very stable, love how it always starts at the beginning to avoid spoilers, and it's very easy to jump to live if you wish.   With a decent guide it would rival Vue for top on our list.  ",1531445752
cordcutters,"Yeah right. I have yet to find a streaming service that was as reliable as traditional satelite/cable. Seems like every time I try out a new streaming service, I'll get random buffering when I need it most (especially DirecTV Now, my god). It's not my internet service (200Mbps) or my hardlined roku/tv. I can't even consider live tv streaming until the reliability goes up.",1532983791
cordcutters,"Yeah. I also hate Cox, they really screwed me also.  Had a contractor who was losing their contract sign me to a deal that didn't exist then Cox wouldn't let me out of the contract.  I should have gone to the State AG's office but I have a small ISP locally and I just canceled Cox and went with them.  Cox said they would put a black mark on my credit but they never did.

",1531805418
cordcutters,"I would try posting this on r/techsupport for more answers. Your TV should support multiple resolutions over HDMI, it should have no problem displaying the 1080p signal out of your macbook. I would confirm you have the TV tuned to the correct HDMI input number that matches the port you are plugged in to and then check the display settings on your macbook to see if the TV shows up as a secondary display and the output to that display is enabled. I'm not a mac user so I don't know the exact place to look, but you should have a spot for display settings that allows you to add a second monitor, mirror, change resolution, etc. ",1531540276
cordcutters,"They were inside of the wall, splitting the main line (coming in), between the bedroom and the livingroom.  The livingroom has two coaxial ports in it, while the bedroom has one.  The tech pulled out the splitters, and ran a dedicated line to the modem.  I re-installed one on the television line to re-connect the bedroom and the livingroom to the same trunk line, so the next tenant can still have television in both rooms (as I do), if they rely on cable.

My antenna is externally joined, (splitter turned around backwards to make it a combiner), and split with a splittter to feed both TV's, (both my livingroom and bedroom).",1532143999
cordcutters,"I had cable.  The cable co went digital.  So far, so good.  Then, they decide to scramble those signals..for Piracy ?  No to force me to rent a box to descramble a signal they just scrambled.and make it free for them to shut off nonpay accounts (no truck roll needed, no facing irate subscribers as you shut them off)...to the tune of $8 per box per month. ($24x12).  Then, shortly thereafter, ESPN decided it needed more money, so that was $6x12. A Sports Fee shows up one month...I don't watch sports or subscribe to any sports channels.  They refused to remove the charge.  I cut the service, returned the boxes, and was done with it.  In short, the Cable Co raised my bill $360 per year, for absolutely nothing.  Like, they just thought it was OK to bag me an extra car payment, or the cost of a lifetime TiVo, for no changes in service.  Luckily, OTA works at my location, a retired Mac Mini streams the usual suspects, and the last time I saw cable was at a hotel.  There was no fast forward and I was amazed at the 5 min commercial/10 minutes of content.  I shut it off.  Watching my kids set up their households, out of school, there are no phone lines or Cable TV lines.  Cell phone + wifi and you're good.  There's a reason that cable TV ads are for horrible end of life products and drugs you never want to need.  My 85 yo inlaws are literally the only people still watching top down TV.",1532486415

cordcutters,PsVue and Hulu are pretty redundant for newer shows.  My wife recently cancelled Hulu after he Handmaids tale was over because any other shows she watched she could just do on demand.  I’d say unless you pay for the commercial free version and you just can’t stand having a single commercial.  Go ahead than cancel it.  If you change your mind you can always add it back.,1533080777
cordcutters,"Run 1 cable into the house, then connect it to a distribution amp, then out to the TVs.  The distribution amp will overcome the signal lose of a splitter. 

The other option would be to connect the antenna only to something like an HD Home Run or a Tablo then distribute the signal over a network. This is the more expensive option as you need devices connected to each TV.  ",1530466639
cordcutters,"Sports networks run one feed nation wide due to their live programming.

Other cable networks have two feeds, East and West.  The west feed is identical to the East feed but is delayed by 3 hours.  Eastern and Central time zones get the East feed and Mountain and Pacific get the West feed.  The broadcast networks will often do the same thing and have two feeds for Prime Time programming.  It gets tricky when you have live sports as they take over both feeds with the same content and when the event is over they have to split the county back up and often have to fill in time on the west coast.  Sunday Night Food is a good example where the East will got to late local news after the game but the West has to fill in time with other programming before the news. 

World News Tonight on ABC is often just tape delayed for the West so you are getting 3 hour old news but if something happens they will actually live broadcast a new version for the West with updated content that the East never gets to see.

This is why most shows are advertised as 9/8c because the 8pm time is still valid for the west coast as they are on a 3 hour delay.  

As all the late night shows are taped in the afternoon so they can be played at the correct time at night for East/West.  This also allows them to do some editing.  Exceptions are shows like SNL that are live for the East but the West is tape delayed.  ",1531326143

CBS News has CBSN and CBS Shorts HQ for free online. For business/financial news, Cheddar and Bloomberg are options. Reuters TV curates the latest news into whatever amount of time you have.

The key is going to be companies keeping the skinny bundles ""skinny"" and not getting into a war of channel numbers like they did with cable/sat over the past couple decades.  If consumers get into the ""More channels = better deal"" mindset that they did with cable/satellite then we are going to end up with what we have today with traditional cable.

Scripted Series:

* Silicon Valley

* Boardwalk Empire

* Oz

* The Deuce

* The Night Of

* Entourage

* The Wire

* The Sopranos

* Veep

* Curb Your Enthusiasm

* Sex and the City

* True Detective

* Deadwood

* Big Little Lies

* The Young Pope

* Vice Principals

* Mr. Show

* Eastbound &amp; Down

* Big Love

* Flight of the Conchords

* Ballers

* The Newsroom

* The Jinx

* Sharp Objects

* Rome

* Westworld

They also have produced some fantastic Mini-Series including:

* Band of Brothers

* The Pacific

* John Adams

There are also a couple of very popular political comedy shows:

* Last Week Tonight with John Oliver

* Real Time with Bill Maher

And an Investigative Reporting show that does....well, really good investigative reporting:

* Vice

There are also loads of stand-up comedy specials if that's your thing, award-winning documentaries, Hard Knocks if you are a big NFL fan.  The list just goes on and on.

Over the last 5 years, HBO has racked up **538** Emmy Nominations (those are for Television, not movies), which is **more than twice as many as any other studio**.  The next closest Studios / Networks are NBC with 245, FX with 220, ABC with 195, and Netflix with 145.  Netflix is certainly coming on, as all of theirs have been in the past two years, but HBO has still outperformed them by significant margins in both years.

cordcutters,"&gt;I do agree that subchannels aren't used as effectively as they could be. When I first heard that digital TV would have the ability to add subchannels, I thought it would be nice to have a subchannel available for overflow programming, usually when a sports broadcast runs long and cuts into the next program.

The problem there though, depending on the individual station, is lack of promotion and/or cable coverage.  NBC, at least here in Los Angeles, has always promoted Cozi TV (as well as their Telemundo sister station) all the time in promotions.  The other local stations here, more or less, promote their subchannels, but some (like our Fox/MyTV duopoly) barely, if at all, bother with it.  As far as sports, all of our local teams are pretty much cable/satellite-only...our regional Fox Sports networks will sometimes farm some games over to the MyTV station (also owned by Fox); they own the broadcast rights to the Angels, Clippers, Ducks, and Kings, and it's very rare that all four are playing at the same time (which would only happen in April, and maybe May).  Spectrum (Charter) owns the broadcast rights to the Lakers and Dodgers (each on their own separate channel); the Dodgers have simulcast some selected games from their network to the local CW station (up to 20 games this season) because most of the L.A. market doesn't get the Dodger network.

The only major market in the country where you still have significant-enough OTA play-by-play coverage of the local teams is Chicago.  Both the Cubs and White Sox still air a good chunk of games on over-the-air (about 70 Cubs games spread between WGN-TV and ABC 7 Chicago, and about 50 or so Sox games just on WGN), and WGN-TV usually carry 30 Blackhawks and 25-30 Bulls games each season.  Besides the 50 combined Mets-Yankees telecasts WPIX carries every season, the NBA and NHL teams in metro New York City are also cable/satellite-only.",1532459432

Instead Tablo basically becomes a network-connected 'server' for your Over-the-Air antenna, delivering live and recorded TV to network-connected devices like streaming boxes and sticks, Smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, PCs and more.

These devices all have free Tablo apps. So just like you'd click the Netflix box to watch Netflix, you then just click the Tablo box to watch your antenna TV content.

TV Tuners have a maximum of 92nmdb at most theoretically before they overload .. it will not burn out the tuner .. it just overloads it to the point it won't work.

a standard antenna will increase the strength of the signal a few db(3-5db).. an amplified antenna will normally amplify the signal about 20 nmdb ... at 97nmdb you are amplifying your signal too much and you will overload your tuner.. this can mean loss of that channel .. it can mean loss of a few channels .. it could mean your tuner is amplified to the point it can not work.

it is unfortunate for you but you have too much signal

the Terk antenna is also better at channels under REAL 14

you have many channels under REAL 14 and using the flat antenna will only pickup UHF of 14 and above

its a bad deal.. unfortunately there are not many small antennas that pickup VHF signals up to REAL 14 other than rabbitears and ones like the terk which is not great but it is somewhat directional

cordcutters,"&gt; Do you really think AT&amp;T would do this if they didn't think it would make them money? Or Dish etc?

ATT can afford to lose money on DTVN. In fact, they are. They can offset losses with their wireless service (which they've raised the price on). And they practically give away DTVN service as it is. Dish also has multiple subsidiaries that they can offset any potential Sling losses from, but they currently lead the market in terms of subscribers, so it's not necessarily an issue for them at the moment.

But that's hardly telling the whole tale.  I am very much in love with huge screens and I have a 65"" 4k screen at home.  That's where I watch most of my television and web content, even YouTube.  I watch YouTube on my phone when it's my only choice and when waiting until later to watch it on the 65"" screen isn't an option.

That said, I'm really enjoying and preferring shorter content these days.  It can be a struggle to get through a 90 minute movie, no matter the screen it's on.  But I don't think Big Media understands that length has never been the real problem, it's that almost everything they make is sappy and unrelatable.  I like YouTube videos because of what they are, not how long they are, but the short form factor just makes it realistic for me to exercise the option to ""consume"" them on a shitty small screen.

cordcutters,"Look, you brought up a very extreme example to compare 35,700,000m to 6m. The fact is, at a distance of 6m, the speed of light is a rounding error. You cannot percieve the timing difference there even if light was 1000 times slower for the calculation at 20uS.

The latency problem has nothing to do with light and everything to do with coder delays, which can only be resolved by reducing coder complexity (using less math to compress the audio) and properly designed ASICs (to optimize the math being performed to the fewest clock cycles).

The real problem is that standard BT is highly compressed so any latency does become noticable. The workaround to that is to delay the video stream so that the audio has time to process; Fine for watching movies or TV, not so good for interactive media.

Why I would claim that semiconductor companies are likely a better source, ie...those router manufacturers faithfully translating reference designs into hardware may have fewer problems.

Software based routers like PFSense or IPFire will always have an update edge, but there's a case that can be made for chip level hardware based NAT like Qualcomm's AN8327N. Find a router based on that chip - you're probably pretty safe. Of course that's assuming the manufacturer didn't misengineer the controls to that chip (sometimes hard to be certain) :(

The AN8327N can handle 750mb/sec according to PFSense developers who are trying to design it into their system so they can avoid expensive high performance CPU boards.

ISP customers SHOULD have better options. They don't.

The reviews on Qualcomm's Streamboost feature suggest it works well.

To ELI5: Over the air TV only has so much “bandwidth” per channel. That “bandwidth” gets distributed via all the sub channels. While it is possible to have 2 HD signals, there won’t be any bandwidth left for any other sub channels. Stations that run 2 HD sub channels see a drop in quality on both. 

This is why most stations (over the air) have 1 HD channel and 3 SD channels. It is possible to run in other configurations, but the 1 and 3 is a pretty good middle ground, since most people don’t watch the sub channels anyway. 

While you can mess with the way the “bandwidth” is allocated, allowing one sub channel more to work with, you will always be in a give-and-take situation when it comes to over the air channels. Some transmission gear is dynamic in the way it allocates space, but you’re still locking into the same overall signal size, no matter what. ",1532397980

The CSR didn't like it much when I called out their marketing as bullshit, and said, ""when, and if I upgrade, it's going to be the 100/10 plan,  and I'm probably going to set up a few more BOINC servers so I can use all of that bandwith.""  (Berkely Open Network Client).  I run Folding@Home and SETI@Home already on a 25/2 connection.

cordcutters,"It depends on your needs.  You say watching college football is important.   The ""base"" packages of most services will get you basic ESPN and ESPN 2 and FS1.  But if you need Fox Sports regional networks, or SEC Network, Big 10 Network, ESPN U and such you generally need to step up a tier.  Do you also watch other sports like NFL, college or pro basketball, etc? 

If you need regional sports your best bets are probably YTTV or Vue.  But since none of the hardware you have will work for with YTTV I'd say Vue depending on local channel coverage.  I don't have much experience with Sling.  If you need regional sports channels, those are actually the cheapest ways to go ($40 and $50 respectively).  You need at least $55 on DirecTV Now to get those.  For sports in particular a feature DTVN lacks that  YTTV and Vue have is the ability to rewind live TV.  That's big for sports, since how many times have you run to the bathroom or the fridge only to miss a big play?  With YTTV and Vue no problem, just rewind a few minutes.  With DTVN the only thing you can do it make sure you pause the TV every time you get up and resume later from that same spot.",1532898895

So I'd recommend just getting a free modem from them (make sure you tell them you want a modem only model) and then buying your own standalone router. Asus or TP-Link are good inexpensive brands.  Just make sure you get one with gigabit ethernet ports, as Charter is in the process of rolling out 200 Mbps as the minimum speed across it's entire footprint, so you don't want to get one limited to 100 Mbps and have to buy a new one when your speeds are upgraded.  You should be able to find one for around $50-$80 (the TP-Link Archer C1200 is $49 at most places).",1530648180

cordcutters,"&gt; Can I use any brand of stick?

Different brands of sticks are made by different companies, have different interfaces, and may have access to slightly different content / apps.

Many people here prefer Roku sticks because they are a neutral company that plays content from many companies.  Other people like $20 Amazon Fire TV sticks (special price today) or $25 Chromecast (no remote control, controlled by your phone or tablet; also special price today) because they are cheap and everywhere.   

Others like more advanced, non-stick devices, like:

*  $105 Apple TV 4K boxes you get with a free 3 months of DirecTV Now
* 4K (non-stick) Roku boxes
* 4K (non-stick) Amazon Fire TV pendants
* 4K Android TV boxes (Mi Box or the Nvidia Shield, both on special today).

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Are they tv specific (what kind of tv do i need)?

They are not TV specific, other than your television set needing to have an HDMI port.  If your TV set does not have an HDMI port, then you would need a different streaming device that offers a different connection interface.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; And as long as I have decent wifi and bluetooth I should be good to go?

Bluetooth is not an issue.  Good wifi connectivity is the issue.  If your wifi signal does not reach behind your television, you will either need a wifi extender/bridge, or to figure out an Ethernet connection to the streaming device.

You will also need a subscription to the content you want to watch.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt; Is it worth getting a 4k tv?

I find 4K television sets to be a worthwhile investment, especially when you buy them cheaply, like as open box at Costco or Sams Club.  For 4k content, you then also need a 4K streaming device, if you want content in 4K, unless you television has built-in apps for that.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Basically, I want to watch NFL, NHL and MLB on a larger screen, but there will be times when I want to stream a movie or something also.

Good, that's what streaming devices are for.  In most cities, you will need a live TV subscription (either through the local cable company or Vue/DirecTV Now/Hulu Live/YouTube TV/Fubu) to watch local sports teams, because many games are not broadcast by antenna.

You will also need a movie subscription for movie streaming (like Netflix or Amazon Prime), or to purchase individual movies to stream.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; I cut the cord years ago and will need to buy a TV ( on the cheaper side, unless there's a big difference) so recommendations are welcome.

As mentioned above, I suggest scouting local Costco and Sams Club locations. Look for open-box television (display models, returned models, and last-item-of-its kind sets).  Look for a special price tag sticker on the back of the TV. Then be friendly to the department manager and ask for a big discount on that.

&amp;nbsp;


&gt; Thank you all. (I googled this but got various and confusing answers due to specific brands of stick).

You're welcome.",1531822084

cordcutters,"Great for you but grandfathered pricing comparisons don’t help anyone looking to move now.  And while YTTV and Philo are separate services, seems like it’s the bottom line cost that matters.

YTTV ($40) plus Philo 49-channel package ($20) = $60 per month

That’s the closest match on channels, admittedly with some variances (YTTV better locals, DTVN has Weather, NHL, Hallmark.) With DTVN, consumers could drop features or channels to save. Then it boils down to individual choice. The baseline Live a Little plan is $40...same as YTTV.  That Live a Little has HGTV, A&amp;E and Nick, which aren’t on YTTV.

It's more expensive ($60/month all-in on a 1-year promotion\* versus $35 to DirecTV NOW) and I do have to run my own Plex server but I was doing the latter anyway and the former is worth it, for now, for what I gained.

cordcutters,"I am not an expert, but from what I understand, 120hz is included in the ATSC 3.0 standard, not 240. I agree that 240hz is overkill, but the potential for 4k broadcast at 120hz is huge for live sports. Watch a soccer ball fly in the air and you will appreciate every additional frame per second to resolve that detail. Even 60fps has a lot of motion blur on a wide panning shot. People on this thread are debating whether 4k detail can be resolved by the naked eye vs 1080p, but that’s really not the point. The point is that the original source material that (under ATSC 3.0) is broadcast at, say, 4k 120fps, will be MUCH higher quality than what you currently get on something like ESPN, which is 720p. Ultimately this means a much higher quality image once the compressed version reaches our TVs. And whether that ends up being 1080p or 4k doesn’t really matter. The point is that the detail will be there in the broadcast, whereas currently it is not. Whether at 1080p or 4k I want to be able to read the names on the back of jerseys in a soccer game, and with current broadcast standards it’s all a blotchy compressed mess.

I suppose you can call it double dipping, but obviously if you’re connecting to get something from somebody they’re both connected and paying to be connected (this seems obvious).

And wait until you see how the ATV ""TV app"" integrates the ABC app, HBO, Hulu, FreeForm, iTunes, Amazon Prime, etc. all into one interface; and can sync where you left off on an episode between devices. It's a game changer IMHO.

BUT any app not on the AppleTV you can run on your iPhone/iPad and mirror it onto the screen.

Get an **AppleTV 4k for $105** ($75 off) at http://directvnow.com/appletv for a limited time (actually, it's free, but you prepay $105 for 3 months of DTV NOW so basically $105 if you don't want the service).",1531346416
cordcutters,"I know your question is rhetorical but streaming services are still only good for specific use cases.  You need decent Internet speed and many need uncapped service to accommodate their TV watching habits. Can’t get live sports, news or local programming on Netflix or Hulu. DVRs on the live streaming services are rudimentary and many/most of their interfaces leave a lot to be desired.  Most services are missing local networks, leaving customers to run an antenna and maintain their own DVR solutions.  Channels and programming are subject to both live streaming and DVR blackouts. 

I say all of this as someone who has been using Directv Now, YouTube TV and Philo for 18 months now. You really need to have a lot of patience and low expectations in order to be satisfied with current streaming products.  Early adopters are the low hanging fruit for these services. They are a long way from being reliable for millions of “average joes” who just want reliable access to their programming.  The masses aren’t going to tolerate DVRs that delete content after 4 weeks, refuse to FF thru commercials, and/or fail to recognize a “new” show vs a rerun. ",1532472977
cordcutters,"You have a few options to get all of the channels on your list  Sling Orange and Blue packages fro $40 will get you all of the channels on your list.  You will need an antenna for your locals I believe and a 50 DVR is optional and costs $5 more. I am not sure about blackout restrictions in Chicago, Sorry.

Directv Now has most of the channels on the list in their (soon to be) $40 package.  FXM is in their next highest tier at $55.  DTVN comes with a 20 hour DVR.  Again not sure about blackout restrictions.  With DTVN you can add HBO for $5.

YouTube TV and Vue don't have Comedy Central so you would need a service like Philo added on to get that channel.  But if that channel isn't all important then YTTV has you covered for $40 and it comes with an unlimited DVR that keeps your recordings for 9 months.  Be aware that if a VOD version of a show you ""recorded"" exist then you may be forced to watch that instead of the DVR version.

Hulu with Live TV doesn't have comedy central nor do they have AMC.

Fubo doesn't have ESPN

cordcutters,"&gt;except for the xfinity default garbled greish analog

Wait, what? Are you sure you're connected to your antenna and not the cable line? In these here United States nobody is broadcasting television in analog, except for small, low-powered broadcasters. On top of that, Xfinity is a cable company, I don't see why they would have any kind of broadcast tower.

Now, moving within the same zip code don't mean nothing for television reception. You could move only half a mile and have a different reception situation. Being near a skyscraper can affect your reception and signal path. Dense trees can affect reception. Different building materials can affect reception. Being on the wrong side of a hill or down in a valley can affect reception.

So for optimal reception you want to make sure your antenna is pointed in the right direction. UHF Loops, which the Leaf is, are directional, and need to be facing the correct direction for optimal reception. [TV Fool](www.tvfool.com/) can help with that.

You should also make sure your antenna is in the least dense place you can hang it. Putting it in a window would be best, but an area largely free from metals, specifically steel, would be a good second choice.

The antenna should also be as high as possible, to have the clearest line of sight path to the transmitter.

Long term solution, if you're willing to put some money into it, could be to use an [HDHomeRun](http://silicondust.com/) to eliminate the tether between your TV set and your antenna. The HDHR is a networked TV receiver, which is nifty because it means you can place your antenna anywhere you can run a network cable and have electricity, and because it's modulated into network feed it's immune to the kind of signal attenuation you can get with long coax cables. However it also means you need some kind of HTPC/DVR or set top box (like the [Nvidia Shield](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/)) to watch TV.",1531575594

cordcutters,"&gt; Reason why ESPN gets the fees they do. .There is the demand.

ESPN over-pays for multi-year league contracts, then leverages their ownership of ABC stations, Disney channel and a smattering of other channels in order to extract fees out of unwilling subscribers and make that money back.

ESPN is in 74% of TV homes (about 87.8 million household subscriptions) The highest viewership ESPN had was a 12 share (12% of 118.4 million homes) -- 10%.

So, on it's the best day, ESPN is only wanted by 10% of the houses with a TV, Yet, 83.4% of households receive (and pay for) the channel.

Of TV homes....
10% - highest viewership, assumes the desire to have the channel.

16.6% - don't want the channel enough to subscribe to a channel package that contains it.

73.4% -- Bound by bundling agreements to have ESPN in their homes as a side effect of wanting other channels. Subsidizes the viewership of the 10%.

cordcutters,"I can see where you could get the thriller vibe from the trailers. It's kind of hard to nail The Expanse down to one genre, but I think I would have to go with sci-fi political drama as the overarching theme. It's set in the relatively near future, with Earth and Mars in an uneasy and unstable truce after Mars' war for independence, and the ""Belters"" (asteroid belt miners) in heavy unrest and wanting their own Independence. Against that constant backdrop, there different sub-genre threads, like murder mystery and some occasional thriller/suspense.

Personally, it's my favorite sci-fi series since the first couple seasons of the BSG reboot, and everyone I know who's seen it has loved it. The plot and characters are complex and nuanced. There's a lot of thought put into keeping the tech and the science as believable as possible for near-future spaceflight and warfare within the solar system.

This also provides them the bandwidth to profit off of their already established service, and potentially pull subscribers away from Netflix as their primary streaming service. 

A Disney only service would be a niche service and would not appeal to all demographics, it would only be a supplemental service to most consumers. 

This also allows for Disney to not have to invest as much into a digital interface and front end service platform for access to customers... (i.e. Apps, website, servers, accounts, in app payment support) this is not an easy task and require a lot of engineering, it would save a lot more money by just improving on the assets they already have then to develop a totally new service.

I would also recommend that you add an antenna to at least one of the TV's so you have something to watch when/if the internet goes out.

cordcutters,"A modem does one thing, and one thing only -- it converts from coax to ethernet and back (which is a very simplified explanation, but for our purposes that will suffice).  If your ISP is a cable company providing a DOCSIS network over coax, you need a cablemodem.  You can buy it yourself or you can rent it from your cable provider, but you need a cablemodem.  Beyond that, you technically don't need anything else, and way back in the day ISPs would actually discourage people from using routers (""You can plug one PC into the cable modem, and that's all."").  Of course if you want to support &gt; 1 device, you'll need a router of some sort.  That's where the confusion comes in.

There are devices that merge a cable modem and a router (and often a wireless access point) into a single device.  ISPs like Comcast call this a ""gateway"", because it's no longer just a modem.  They'll try to tell you that you *need* a ""gateway"" to get access to their service^(1).  You don't.  You need a modem.  The gateway provides a modem, but you can also provide a modem separately.  You can also of course go and buy a gateway device to own yourself instead of renting one.

If you buy your own modem or gateway and you're paying your ISP money every month to rent a modem or gateway, you absolutely can and should return the ISP-provided device so that they stop charging you $10-20/mo.  Of course you can certainly keep their modem and keep paying them monthly for that rental and still use your own.  But that would be really silly, wouldn't it?

^(1) There are some services ISPs provide where it may actually be true that you need a gateway.  For example, if you want &gt; 300Mbps service and Digital Voice on Comcast, you'll need one of their Gateway devices, because there are no Digital Voice-compatible cable modems with telephony in a configuration better than 8/4 which means they cap out around 340Mbps theoretical and 300Mbps practical.",1532283449

cordcutters,"Especially if the NFL and NBA are priorities, Vue Core ($45 a month moving to $50 by the end of the month) is probably your best bet.  It's got all of the major sports networks and regionals.   It's one of the few that has NFL Network (YTTV and DirecTV Now don't have it, at least not yet) and the ability to add NFL Redzone during the season for an extra $10 a month.  Me being a fantasy football fanatic... Redzone is well worth the $10 to me.  

The Core plan covers pretty much all the sports networks... all the ESPNs (ESPN2, ESPNNews, ESPNU) including SEC Network and Longhorn Network, Big Ten network, NBA TV, CBS and NBC Sports Networks, Golf Channel, Fox Sports 1 and 2 and Fox Sports regionals (local NBA and MLB teams).  I think the only sports channels it might be missing that some others carry are Tennis Channel and NHL Network, but to me NFL Network trumps those both.

Sling technically can get mostly the same channels as Vue (including Redzone).  I think NHL Network is possible on Sling, but Big Ten Network is not.  It's just appears kind of convoluted, you have to Do Sling Orange + Blue + Sports Pack to get the same combo of channels.  But where the sports add on for Vue is really just for true ""premium"" stuff like Redzone, ESPN Goal line and such.  The Sports pack add on for Sling is needed for more ""essential"" stuff like SEC network, ESPN U, ESPN News, NBA TV etc.  So you may end up needing the ""sports add on"" pretty much year round with Sling, where you might only need it for NFL Redzone with Vue.  Also BIG CON with Sling is no CBS.  So the top SEC football game of the week won't be on and your missing AFC football games.  Also if you want DVR you have to pay to add it on Sling where it's included free with Vue (and YTTV), and you get 1 less stream than Vue.  Also lot of people complain about the Sling interface and reliability compared to Vue.  You may want to just trail it and see what you think.

They also don't want the burden of maintenance across the state, every fiber line in every town. 

One of the first towns to get Verizon FiOS was Epping,NH. They made a run, tested it and quickly realized they would have to provide it to all homes in state based on the agreements. All those little shacks up near the Canadian border would have to get it. Verizon sold northern New England (vt, NH and me) to Fairpoint communications. Since the sale, no further rollout of fiber.

cordcutters,"Until 1996 when I grew up.  Even after we got a C-Band dish, that only serviced the livingroom, and we were locked on to Galaxy 5.  Every other TV in the house was OTA only.  It was that way until the day I moved out in 2005.  When I first moved to town, I signed up for Basic Broadcast cable, ($5/mo), and was amazed at the clarity, no static, and no messing around with the antenna anymore.  

I put my antenna in storage, and had either cable or satcomms until 2015 when I simply couldn't afford it anymore, and cut it off.  I remembered ""antenna"", and put it up, expecting to see the same staticky crap that I grew up with, but ""hey, it's free"".  I was amazed when I did a channel scan, and I got crystal-clear 6 channels at the time, (at my old residence), in the space where there used to be 2 channels.  That's how I found out about the ""new thing"" called sub-channels.  I only got PBS stations, but I got 6 channels of it, so I had plenty of TV.

I moved into where I am now, and free analog cable was with the rent.  So I hooked up my TV's to the line and watched TV.  Since I had analog TV's at the time, (had to sell off my 42"" TV due to financial reasons), that worked well for me for 8 months until one of my friends gave me her old flat TV.  I hooked up the flat TV to the cable, and was disappointed by the quality of analog cable that I used to think was so amazing when I first moved to town.  

Back to my aerial I went, and did a channel scan to find ... **18 channels free out of the sky!**.  That made me a happy camper.  I stopped even using the free analog cable, and went to my aerials only until I bought my Roku and got my Plex server configured.  

Now, analog has been turned off, but I don't even care, as I never really watched it in the first place after I got flat panel televisions in 2017.  I've not paid for television since 2015, except for Curiosity Stream, a couple months of SlingTV, a couple months of Philo, a couple months of DTVN, and PBS Passport.

I use my aerials, Plex server, (which records OTA), my HDHR Connect, and my Roku.  It serves my needs 100% fine.  Why would I be wanting cable, when I can get everything I'm interested in for 100% free, legally?  I bought PBS Passport to support KUID, and Curiosity stream on a lark because I might watch it.  I haven't even watched Curiosity Stream, even though I paid up for a year of it.  I do use PBS Passport, but most of my TV consumption is via my aerials.",1532980700

1. List of Spectrum compatible modems is [here](https://www.timewarnercable.com/en/support/internet/topics/modems.html)
2. Leaving FiOS won't be easy.  They will charge you standard rate since you're not considered new customer.  Look at your current bill, it will show the rate minus current discounts.  You will loose the discount.  FiOS is only interested in internet subscribers if you're a new customer.  You may also get charged with a termination fee.  All depends on your current contract.   It will be a frustrating experience, just prepare yourself for it, and if you can do everything via chat so that at least you'll have the record.  You will not be able to schedule a cancellation date.  You may not receive a cancellation confirmation email (I never did).  You'll need to call them couple of days before your ""deadline"", and be prepared for them cutting that service right after the call: they make no guarantees.
3. If you leave FiOS you must return their equipment within 30 days.  They will either ship you a label, or you can drop it off at any local Verizon store.  Be sure to keep the receipt.  I am glad I did because I needed it to prove my STB was returned. You will keep the ONT box on your property.
4. If you leave FiOS and have autopay setup, cancel it as soon as you can.  After my service was cancelled they kept billing me for the service cycles after my termination date.  It was a frustrating experience to get that all straightened out.  If I left my auto-pay on, I would have had to add issues of refunds to that whole fiasco.

I now have 3 TCLs. Just got the 6-Series 55"" for our living room and I never need to leave Roku for anything, except occasionally switch over to my Shield to manage my Plex server. That's all I need the Shield for anymore. The built-in Roku is that good.

Now, that's not to say that the Roku won't eventually slow down and I'll start leaning more and more on external sources. But hell, by then, the Roku sticks will be even more powerful and nearly disposable. Either way, I feel like I'm going to get at least 4-5 years of solid performance out of these TCLs.

cordcutters,"Funny because we were getting ready to quit cable and saw the $21.99 for 2 years streaming package advertised on the last billing statement. The same day, I read 2 other big streaming companies raised their prices I think to at least $30, so I gathered up all the equipment, went down and signed up for a savings of about $850/year from prior service.

Funny thing was they wanted me to fill out the sheet chosing the 10 ""premium"" channels or whatever the term, and I honestly ran out at 8 and literally just randomly chose the last 2. 

I'm new to ""cordcutting"" and not sure why I see so many negatives about this package from other posters, maybe it's just the fact that its spectrum, I don't know. 

I realize their pricing practices suck,  but the girl there couldn't have been nicer or more honest. I did try one last time to get a better deal on the rate, but I could tell she couldn't do it and I didn't want to play games or wait for a supervisor or whatever, but she did what she could and threw in some extras. 

For us it was an easy, first step and solution since we live in the middle of nowhere and I don't want to spend the money or try figuring out what kind of antenna setup would be required to pull the local stations we wanted and again, the other streaming companies look like they're priced at least 30-40% higher than this (and I'm not sure if you can lock those rates for 2 years).

cordcutters,"Others have answered your question but I thought I should mention that cable companies have techs whos sole job is to drive around with a leakage meter searching for signal leaks.  It wasn't a huge issue back in the analog days when I did cable as the worst that would happen is someone would accidentally hook their rooftop antenna to the output of a splitter, screwing up local broadcast channels for their neighbors (and sometimes transmitting cable channels out the antenna).  Now that they're cramming signal into every permissible frequency on that cable, signal ingress has become a real problem making it a lot more important to find the source of leaks and fix them.",1532880539
cordcutters,"Yes -- the only reason the Winegard may perform better (and I would need to see some models run or for Winegard to release specs like any reputable antenna dealer would - but which they don't) is simply due to the larger size than the other flat antennas.  It's fairly easy to take off the covering and look at the design (or just hold it up to the light) -- there's nothing magic about it (or their whisker/bow-tie design).  It's a UHF antenna that happens to pick up VHF-Hi if the conditions are right for it.  I used to have one also.  In one location - it clearly performed better for VHF-Hi than other UHF antennas simply because of surface area.  In the previous location, an RCA horizontal plastic antenna performed better.  It's all a crap-shoot with these pseudo-antennas - but they have a market for those who are unable or unwilling to put up a proper antenna.  Remember the first rule of Antenna Marketing:  ""The more lies you tell ... the more antennas you sell"".  I just pass by any company that won't provide a gain sheet.  Stellar Labs is my preferred antenna company of choice for value and performance followed by Antennas Direct if I'm more concerned about aesthetics.",1531153871
cordcutters,"Your sporadic speed tests imply you have issues not related to what speed testing site you're using. I'd be willing to bet at different hours of the day any given test would give you wildly different results.

This is a cable line right? It is likely you have a weak (or sometimes too strong) cable connection. You could have a fault in a line or a bad termination inside or out to the pole. Its more common than you'd think. I have a close friend who does installs and climbs poles for Comcast and hes always having to install amplifiers or even intentionally introducing resistance sometimes. It also seems weird that a signal that is ""too good"" can cause problems, but it can. My internet was dropping randomly every couple hours until I was given a little adapter to introduce resistance to my coaxial run to lower the signal to a stable level.

Less likely would be your cable modem or router causing the issue. You didn't mention if you are doing these tests over wifi or hard-wired, the model(s) of your modem/router, any software or hardware firewalls running, etc...

I see

&gt;The study is based on data collected in June from 1,933 US consumers  with broadband who watch at least one hour of TV per week. One  significant change in methodology from the 2017 study, Giegengack said,  is the use of the one-hour threshold. Hub used to use five hours of  viewing a week, which skewed results toward more avid TV viewers.

so how many people only watch 1 hour of tv a week

crap i watched an hour of tv in the past 30 minutes .....

cordcutters,"If there's no difference between the plans in any way other than the download speed (since it sounds like the upload speed would be the same,) I'd probably go with the 60Mbps cable. FTTN (or fiber to the node), at least in the US, means that there's a telephone company box that's fiber fed within a few blocks of you, with copper lines carrying it from that box into your home. It usually works fine, and I have it because the upload speed is better on that than what the cable company offers, but the pings are a bit higher and with my telco's specific setup it's hard to find third-party modems to use. Pings are a bit higher than what cable is, but not by much (maybe a 10ms difference.)

If it was true fiber to the premise, then I'd say go with fiber, but if it's just fiber to the node (which FTTN suggests) then I wouldn't see any particular advantage of that technology versus cable; I'd focus on other factors before that.",1532098079

Or if I see something that catches my eye, I can just drop it into an ""Eventually"" category. Or maybe even just split it up between movies and TV shows.

I suspect that by the year 2030 over 50&amp;#37; of residential broadband will be delivered via cellular or some other form of wireless communication.

I don't know why people keep throwing around bandwidth caps. Six years ago it was all about ""unlimited will never be back."" Now it is. And on the unlimited plans you're de-prioritized after a certain amount and that amount keeps creeping up. TMo is at 50GB/mo now. It's just going to keep going up until there is, essentially, no throttling for the vast majority of users.

I guess what I'm saying is - Any providers that are entrenched in to a wired-only deployment with no plans of moving towards wireless technology are doing nothing now but simply watching the calendar waiting to become irrelevant.

It's the equivalent of your town (at least mine did) having two dozen dial-up networking ISP's in the mid-late 90's and then maybe two or three in the mid 2000's as cable and DSL became widely deployed.

Except this time it's worse because even in rural areas where it was not cost-effective to deploy broadband because of the sparse population all TMo/AT&amp;T/Verizon/Dish have to do is put up a few extra towers, upgrade the existing ones, and all of the sudden they're serving internet to hundreds of people that could only get DUN or Sat access just a few years earlier.

And that's not even taking in to account SpaceX's Starlink program. While I think that the long-term goal for Starlink will be directed more towards commercial uses there will definitely be a market for residential use in places where it's not even cost effecting to provide cellular data access.

tl;dr - Residential wired internet offerings are dying and small CLEC's will be the first to go - regardless of the FCC decision on UNE.

https://forums.xfinity.com/t5/TV-Archive/Cable-Card-not-receiving-quot-Validation-Signal-quot/td-p/1361229

This is a provider F’up, not CableCard. Although I guess I should point out that that issue is now pretty much moot as so few Prime clients can even support Copy-Once DRM (remaining Win 7/WMC is in serious decline). Plex (which I use a lot) and SD promised Copy-Once DRM support in their software but I don’t recall ever seeing it materialize. 

Otherwise, Prime has been issue free. I took out of service because on my Dbl Play re-up, Comcast increased the fee 20% (from $105 to $129), and required 2 yr contract (up from 1 yr contract). My Dbl Play was for lowly digital starter, so $25 Sling plus $10 four pack add-ons gives way more channels. I intentionally omitted ESPN (required $15/mo) as I detest them, but may begrudingly add them during College Hoops season.

As work-around for no DRM client support (e.g., on HBO and Starz), one could theoretically use TV Everywhere log in. But this is where being a Comcast CableCard customer becomes unbearable. Comcast BLOCKED HBO TV Everywhere log in, until HBO finally complained to FCC. Then Comcast did ditto to Starz/Encore, and I believe that block is still in place. Comcast did these blocks because the standalone apps were potentially competitive to Comcast’s X1.",1532802763

Some of the more nasty HOAs are known to include provisions stating that the homeowner will be held responsible for any legal fees incurred by the HOA, which means they often get to skip the step of trying to get the court to award them attorney fees and instead just send you a bill because you technically already agreed to that when you bought the home/joined the HOA. 

You also are the only one who knows how litigious your HOA board is. I have seen some horror stories of fights over everything from curtains to cloths lines over on r/legaladvice, but I also know that plenty of homeowners and HOA's (like the one in my grandparents community) have a very lax attitude and an ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" approach.

The surfboard works flawlessly. I can’t recommend it enough. There are also other versions of the same modem that accommodate higher speeds. 

The router is unavailable from Amazon. I’ll give it 4 stars. Needs to be reset once a month or so, also have to keep firmware up to date. But the speed of the router is very good and it was very affordable. I live in a 3,000 SF home and the router gets signal across the entire house.

&gt; Rather than flipping on live TV to see what&amp;#039;s on, viewers are increasingly defaulting to on-demand sources like SVOD services, according to a new study by Hub Entertainment Research.

&gt; For viewers aged 18-34, the pattern is more stark - only about a quarter of the demo lists live TV as a default, compared with 35% a year ago.

&gt; &amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve been watching live TV drop steadily as a default source since we first conducted this study in 2013,&amp;quot; said Peter Fondulas, a principal at Hub and co-author of the study.

I get about 30 channels with my antenna. But I don't live far from the transmitters (25 miles), and I live in the flatlands. I get all the local channels except the local ABC channel because it transmits in the low VHF band, and most of the popular ""HDTV"" antennas can't receive them.

Each TV must have some kind of cord to deliver the signals. They aren't going to get them by magic. I have 2 TVs, each has its own antenna.

I've experienced this exact phenomenon YouTube TV (which I can't believe is still a problem in 2018) and when commercials can't be skipped, my only remaining remedy is the mute button.  Though I still subscribe to YouTube TV and plan to do so for the foreseeable future, because I care more about price and content availability than I care about having to sit through ad breaks, and there isn't a competing service that delivers a good compromise on all fronts.  Right now everyone is picking what shortcoming(s) they hate the least.

But individual apps are not a solution for me.  Cord cutting for me is as much about convenience as it is about lower price.  I don't want to have to download several different apps and remember which one I have to use for which show to avoid commercials.  Just choosing between YTTV and Netflix is more than enough for me, and if either of them get to the point where they provide more trouble than value, especially to the point where I'm downloading something else to fix a problem they created, they're getting cancelled.",1531937352

Even if you subscribe to all of them at once (which costs a hell of a lot more than $8/month), you can't get to the point Netflix was, where pretty much everything that you could stream anywhere ever was on Netflix. And that's what Netflix was like (with almost no originals) when it was actually starting to become huge, so I think it's a fair bet that that was exactly why most people loved it.

I like some the original content, but I miss that selection. And, honestly, 90% of the original content is crap, and this is a *really* bad trade lately. Type ""I am legend"" into Netflix, and the top result is Bright. Type ""Men in black"" and there isn't even an original suggestion, top result is National Treasure. Search for ""Pursuit of Happyness"" and there aren't even any suggested results.

Fuck Bright (what a waste of a concept!), give me any of the actually-good Will Smith movies from the past -- a shitty movie that you can exclusively watch on Netflix remains a shitty movie.

cordcutters,"That is covered in the first two paragraphs of the article I posted. 

To give an extreme example it's why satellite internet has more latency than cable internet does. Signals delivered through air take longer to arrive than wired signals there's also further processing to be done since you've got a DAC on both sides as well as the TX / RX circuitry itself.

It all adds up and the very best wireless headphones I can find will give you 20ms of delay, with most wireless headsets adding 100ms or more. 

You don't have to take my word for it, read the article I posted and watch the videos. Find your headphones on the list, then watch the embedded youtube videos and judge for yourself.",1531759880

cordcutters,"I appreciate your constructive dialog.  Just to address a few of those bullet points:

* I do get all my local stations, including sub-channels through OTA, which is a simple button press on the remote to change the source, same as changing a channel, super easy (I am aware not everyone can get their locals OTA).
* Actually you can skip commercials, same as with cable.  Obviously you cannot with live TV on cable or OTT services.
* I can watch any channel on up to 5 devices at a time.  Cable charges you per box...streaming services do not.
* If I haven't watched something in 4 weeks, it probably wasn't that important.  However, since almost all programs re-air, I've seen shows stay on DVR well over a year.  
* DVR is unlimited on some services...cable cannot match unlimited DVR
* Why would I care about new shows only being recorded when I have an unlimited DVR?  Same for a show that is broadcast on more than one channel.
* I have not had any issues recording any channels I want to record.   The few that I've heard of still have on demand for their shows.
* Again, why would I want to delete shows when they aren't using up space?
* You can rewind live TV on some services. 
* Finally, thank goodness for that last one!   It is definitely not a shortcoming.   I do not need, nor do I want, any technician in my home.   Streaming is incredibly simple and I truly cannot imagine how anyone would need any significant in-home assistance.

It's perfectly OK if these services are not what you are seeking.  But for many of us, we do feel we have a truly superior product.  We're not ""tolerating"" anything.   I don't think many of us are trying to mirror cable 100%.   Therein lies the problem for many folks.   They are trying to replicate the cable experience exactly.   

We didn't cut cable specifically to save money, but as I've posted before, it is a happy side effect.  

I do agree that they will continue to innovate and add features as time goes on.

cordcutters,"&gt; Last Week Tonight is entertainment as much as it is programming. Most people who voraciously consume news programming--even stuff like Hannity or Anderson Cooper--don't want time delayed snippets posted to social media.

And I still don't understand this -- ""time-delayed"" is usually the same day. By far most news is news I don't even need to know that day. But for people who care more about getting urgent news than accurate news, reading Twitter directly is going to be faster than waiting for someone to read Twitter to you on TV.

We may be talking past each other, though -- if the argument is that many people prefer to get their news from cable TV, sure, that's objectively true. (For now -- Fox's viewership is aging compared to the competition.) But this article was an opinion piece about how streaming is better, and I still think it's clearly a better way to consume news. (For example: Fox's viewership is *less informed* than people who don't follow the news at all.)

&gt; Agree or disagree with the philosophy, Fox News is still the highest rated cable network.

Sure, the highest-rated *cable* network, with a very aging viewership. So this is a relevant number today, but it doesn't seem likely to last -- I doubt foxnews.com is particularly high-traffic compared to Reddit or Facebook.

&gt; Except that Netflix has its own agenda to keep pushing you toward their ""latest and greatest"" exclusive content, regardless of how it crosses genre barriers.

Do you see this play out in recommendations? I don't, much -- mostly, I see them pushing it hard on the main page, to the point where I won't even load the website on anything larger than a phone. (Because they don't play video ads on the Android app.)

&gt; Could AMC be successful charging $10-15 per month commercial-free for The Walking Dead, Better Call Saul, Preacher and a handful of others? How about FX for Legion, Atlanta, Baskets and Archer?

I'd pay that much if Breaking Bad was still on the air. (Better Call Saul didn't interest me at all.) I guess the question I have is, would it be viable for them to do *both*? I don't mind an ad-supported version being available, what I hate is when there's *only* an ad-supported version (that also costs money!)

&gt; To generate the same $177 billion in revenues on an ad-free basis, households would have to fork over an average of $1475 each per year or $123 per month.

Yikes. I have to concede that's a lot of money, but this now throws into sharp relief the amount of money we all spend on products that need that much advertising. I mean, by the same math, we must be spending *at least* that much already in buying, say, big brand names over products like [no-ad](https://www.no-ad.com/about). It's possible we don't have many choices like that, of high-quality products that don't spend so much on advertising, but I'm not sure I find that comforting.

...I realize this may come across as a deflection, and I don't mean it that way -- I take your basic point, that killing ads would kill a lot more shows than I thought. 

&gt; Remember there are tens-of-millions of consumers who pay NOTHING for OTA tv from the broadcast networks.

This, I have less of a problem with. This was one of the great things about the early Internet, that ads could pay for a bunch of free stuff, which is great for people who can't afford to pay, and great for stuff that couldn't really be monetized any other way.

My objection is to the combination of ads *and* a subscription fee.",1532924109

If I remember the numbers right, Netflix has about 50M-60M subscribers in the US alone. That's around half of their overall subscriber count. The US is 325M people out of 7.4B on the planet. As we get to 1-2B+ households with fast internet access there absolutely is a path for Netflix to grow to 200-300M+ subscribers world wide. They are still growing by 20M subscribers a year (with the speed of growth generally accelerating) so within 5 years they will already by over 200M subscribers unless there is a dramatic drop-off in subscription growth. A dramatic drop in growth is very unlikely considering how low international market penetration is and how emerging markets will continue to have increased income and better broadband access. At worst they might drop down to 10-15M new subscribers a year vs. 20M+. Either way they are getting to 200M and potentially 300M.

**TL;DR: This article is a joke as clearly Netflix is nowhere near its ultimate peak subscriber count.**",1532119032
cordcutters,"This is an often neglected aspect of things! My Dad is super tech savy and likes to try to homebrew together new solutions all the time. The living room at their house has no fewer than 10 remotes, ROKU, Chromecast, other miscellaneous devices and raspberry pies hooked up at any one time. Which he can all work perfectly. But my poor mom often has to call me for help with Microsoft word when she does anything more complex than change the font. So when he cord cut the first time, he had all these systems set up and thought things would be great. Cue my mom being completely unable to make anything work, many arguments ensuing, and then her resigning them up for cable because she got so fed up with not being able to watch her shows. 

When he tried again I talked him into getting some very basic solutions and doing baby steps. I actually convinced him to buy a specific DVD Player/DVR system because its remote had a big red netflix button I was sure my Mom could understand to press.

I mean, I get it. I used to be scared of my neighbors, too, not because they looked or acted all that scary but because, well, they were strangers. I thought I had nothing in common with them but geographical happenstance. I kept myself to myself and tried not to make eye contact.

I'm so glad that some of my neighbors were less standoffish than I was being. My dog dug under the fence and went for a walk in the wide, wide world--and would have been lost for sure, if the neighbor across the street hadn't recognized her from seeing us on our walks. She took my dog to my next-door neighbor's and asked them to watch her, which they did, all day, until I got home. That's how I met two of my neighbors, and it grew from there. Turns out, my little street is actually a small but welcoming community of really nice folks, and I missed out on a lot of neighborly fellowship by being a dick the first couple years I lived here.

cordcutters,"Video game companies have an excuse: They are delivering actual software onto actual platforms, sometimes with wildly different hardware. I do like Zelda, and I wish I could play it on a PC, but I understand that running something built for a custom OS, an arm CPU and a Tegra GPU... might have trouble running on an x86_64 CPU and a modern Geforce or Radeon. Not that they *couldn't* do it -- the above hardware is quite different than the Wii U's PPC CPU and sorta-Radeon-like GPU -- but it would take actual time and effort.

You could maybe argue that this excuse wears thin as the hardware becomes similar, but the software is still different enough. Sure, my PS4 has an x86_64 CPU and an almost-off-the-shelf AMD GPU, but it's also running some BSD-based OS, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's a proprietary graphics API, neither of which is especially close to anything on my PC.

None of that applies to shows or movies. There's zero extra technical work to be done to put every movie into a single service.

Granted, there's business reasons on top of all of that, and I've argued that this leads to a certain kind of unlimited budget that gives you games you just wouldn't be able to get anywhere else -- God of War doesn't have to make all of its profit on its own, it could almost even *lose* money and make it back in console sales, if people are buying PS4s just to play God of War. That means it can avoid being crammed full of microtransactions, and it'll have the time and resources to get stuff right and polish things to an extent most games can only dream of. Here's the thing, though: A PS4 cost $400 at launch, and they can sell online services on top of that, *and* they get a cut of every game I buy on that platform. I don't think there's anywhere near that much money in a Netflix subscription, and as you point out, they're not as sticky of a purchase -- people will cancel their subscription for a few months and then come back. And, at the same time, that same subscription fee has to pay for all the cross-platform content...

For example, YTTV records and allows you to FF including preview thumbnails.. but depending on the show, it’s converted to VOD after the recording finishes .. which won’t affect you because you’d be FF while the recording is still showing. 

DTVNow does as well, but there aren’t any preview thumbnails.

I presume you can also do this with Hulu with Live TV, but you may have to buy the extended DVR. 

Long story short, all DVRs should allow this functionality more or less.. most come with free trials. I recommend you try them out and see if they meet your needs. ",1532185124
cordcutters,"I did the math and research for myself regarding the 5 shows that we watched on cable when I decided to cut the cord. 

I currently do just pay for the season pass usually via Amazon Prime because for some reason it sounds better to me than the Google season pass. 

Anyway, I realized that I would be spending about 100.00 per year buying a season pass for the shows we watch vs 35.00 per month which adds up fast. 

We don't watch Live TV anymore at all. It is all DVR'ed OTA, Netflix, Amazon Prime (for the original content and season passes + we have always used it for the shipping, etc.). We will purchase a sub to HBO once a season of a show we watch is completed then just binge watch and cancel. 

As far as the prices for a season pass, it ranges from 14.99 to 19.99 depending on what the show is that you want to watch. You could wait until the season is over as sometimes there are discounts for the season but it really depends on how popular the series you are watching is.

I don't know of any ONE place to go and see a list of the prices. I would literally just check Google Play for what they charge, then check the price on Amazon and also check Vudu for their pricing and decide from there.",1532402706
cordcutters,"Yes and I am counting internet costs.  But that issue only really makes sense if you don’t have broadband at home anyway.  Don’t most people who would be OTT customers still need that regardless of TV?  After all they are often also using services like Netflix or Amazon Prime.  I suppose there are some who could just live off their phone wireless plan for all internet needs (and come reliable 5G there may be more of that).  But Vue, DirecTV Now, Sling etc can work over cell phone wireless networks too (granted picture quality would not be as good or reliable, as home broadband but again that may change in the future). 

There are those like my retired father who only watch TV at the retirement home.  But he was never part of the “target customer base” for OTT.  But for my demo (working professional homeowners with a wife and a couple of kids) you kind of HAVE to have broadband internet these days to work from home, schoolwork and such.

In my case “bundling” tv and internet only saved $10.  For some maybe your internet jumps up a lot more if you unbundle.  For me I get 100:100 internet for 60 then whatever Vue/DirecTV now etc is on top of it.   Worst case say it’s football season and I want to pay the extra 10 for Redzone and I keep HBO when a show I want to watch is playing.  I pay 60 internet plus now 50 for Core plus 10 for Redzone plus 15 for HBO.  Total 135 TV/Internet (let’s say 141 so after tax).  My last cable bill for the equivalent package was 230 a month!  And no having Viacom channels was not worth 90 a month!  46 of my bill was simply fees and rental of 2 additional boxes to cover all 3 TVs in the house.

- Yes, you can only watch that channel on one device at a time.

- Yes, you can only stream to 2/3/4 devices at a time.

- Yes, the DVR will delete everything after 28/30 days.

- Yes, the DVR will only hold 20/50 hours of programming.

- No, you cannot set the DVR to record only “new” episodes.

- No, you cannot record anything on that channel.

- No, you cannot program the DVR to just record a program on one specific channel.

- No, you cannot delete programs from the DVR.

- No, you cannot set the DVR to start recording a few minutes early or to extend past the scheduled end time.

- No, you cannot rewind a live show. 

- No, they will not send a technician to your house to install or diagnose problems. 

Admittedly, that’s a collection of shortcomings across all of the services.  But every single service falls victim to numerous items on this list.  Streaming does have its benefits but nearly all of them revolve around some form of cost savings. My last cable setup included a TiVo box that I owned.

cordcutters,"We have a 4-tuner Tablo here at the house and love it. The only local channel that any of the streaming services carry is Fox, so being able to get locals and a DVR for it was a ""must have"" when we cut the cord last year. 

The biggest pluses with the Tablo (in my opinion):

* Only one cable run. Because the Tablo is a network device, we can access it via any device in the house, as well as remote access. 

* One of the gripes I have with the DVR'd streaming services is that FF or RR sucks. You kind of learn that on certain stations and shows that you need to FF for x minutes to get past the commercial break. With the Tablo, you can see thumbnails while FF and RR, so it's more like the traditional DVR UI that we're used to.

* Support is very responsive. Anytime I have any questions, the guys are very fast to respond. Their community forum is active as well, so you can often get help from other users as well (if needed).

* Active development by Tablo. What I mean by that is that they do a good job on continuing to add features to the app's. The biggest is the announcement of including 5.1 audio in the firmware update being rolled out. But, they have a Preview app, along with their ""stable"" app, that they roll out with some neat features that allows everyone to test out and see the upcoming stuff. 

* Third party apps. Tablo has an unpublished API (I'm waiting on the NDA from their legal dept to get access to it), and there are third party applications people have written that allow you to pull the videos off of the Tablo and store in on a larger NAS, etc... 

* No other setup/devices are needed. I don't have to worry about setting up a Plex server or anything like that. That makes setup really easy.",1532698291
cordcutters,"A friend of mine started a small mom and pop ISP in a rural community. I work on (design/build out) long range radio networking for a private companies needs. Help him out pretty often with his network. Going wireless ""to the home"" definitely saves a lot of money without impacting quality/performance. The local DLS company and cable company are all more expensive and have lower performing speeds compared to his wireless ISP. They do provide TV as well, which he only provides internet so he can't fully compete with them.  


He got a little push back from the bigger ISPs, but they didnt fight him too much. (probably too small a market to worry about). A case was brought against him to the local city government, a vote in the community was help, and with overwhelming support from the community he was given operating permits/permission what have you and he's been off and running ever since.   


We've pulled fiber in some places between nodes, but for the most part the network consists of relay towers spread throughout the area. Usually on land owned by a customer of who just really, really wanted better service.   


His plans I believe are currently 45/10Mb and 75/15Mb. But in testing (at my home and a couple others where he didn't impose a cap) the system was good for \~200Mbps.  


I have since moved to a location in a bigger city and have fiber to the home and a gigabit service. I send him speed tests from to time to time as a joke and to keep him humble. ""Hey B, just reminding you your service sucks!"" Screen cap of 960Mbps down.  


As he grows and gets more clients he is able to upgrade to newer/better equipment and afford to purchase better back haul connections for his service. He, and all other wireless providers have a long way to go. But they can be competitive and provide a great service.

cordcutters,"my feelings about recording are that they want to control the content.. and this is why they are moving in this direction....

Comcast has already stated that their new boxes will be IP Based Streaming and the only way you can locally record will be with a CableCard until that technology is done away with... 

I have talked with a few people in texas and other areas where the updates to systems are disabling the ability for cable card tuners to work with their CableCards.... 

Under an agreement with the FCC and Congress cable providers are required to provide CableCards but they are going to end this and say it is technology... not them

that is not true... its their adoption of different technology.

what results is you can not record your shows on your own media and save them...

If you wanted to record the 4th of July event or Election Coverage or The news when something important to you was on... or just your favorite TV show ... you can not do it unless it is saved on their servers...

If you didn't know there are many instances of the internet being cleaned of content that important people and the government doesn't like.. they use copyright laws incorrectly and take down content.. they strong arm the media or the media does it on their own because they are biased and corrupt...

I do not want to go to a system where tuners can't record to my local devices because then i have no control of it... political winds can change and they can erase the past.

for instance something as innocent as The Little House on The Prairie which was made into a tv show.. most people didn't read the books that it was based on by laura ingles .. but Libraries are taking that book off their shelves because they say it paints a poor view of females.... what insanity.. in that book and the tv show you can see strong women working beside their spouses and others to build our country from nothing... it paints a great light on strong women.. but these books are being taken out of libraries.. this can no where be associated with Huck Finn or Catcher in the Rye but even those books are history ... and they are being taken off shelves and burned ... burning history.. not teaching the real past.. this is what happens.

I believe the truth should be told because that is the only way we learn to be better.

CBS doesn't have control over the subchannels of affiliates that aren't owned and operated by CBS. Back in the earlier days of ATSC and back when CBS held exclusive rights to broadcast the NCAA tournament, WRAL set up 4 channels on their digital broadcast and ran all the tournament games.

I do agree that subchannels aren't used as effectively as they could be.

cordcutters,"Going to have to demur. Comcast isn’t substituting H.264 for MPEG2, they are adding H.264 *ON TOP OF* an already compressed MPEG2 signal, which is of course how terrestrial OTA comes out of original transmitter.  H.264’s codec does not somehow magically restore information to a signal already compressed with MPEG2. 

The comparison isn’t between two codecs, it’s between video compressed with a first codec, vs. that video compressed with said first codec and then *further compressed* with a second codec. 

That the second codec is better does not improve that video, other than bit rate. And in reality, MPEG-2 encoded OTA video looks WAY better than Comcast taking that video and further compressing to H.264, even holding resolution constant, as Comcast chooses to compress the shit out of it, such that a lot of the picture info that survived the original MPEG2 compression is dinged.  Comcast compresses down to 25% of source MPEG2, which is far in excess of what anyone is quoting for H.264 efficiency.

Yeah if we were talking about manufacturing DVDs, and started with raw uncompressed video, I get your point.  Problem with applying your logic here is that MPEG2 compression doesn’t go away - it’s in the source signal (i.e., retrans’d local broadcast) Comcast starts with.  Sure H.264 is more efficient but not anywhere near the level it would need to be to support stingy Comcast’s bitrate allocation. Point is, Comcast takes X and compresses the shit out if it - far in excess than what normally would be done - such that much video info is lost from X. And what X itself is originally encoded with, could have even been H.265, is irrelevant (other than making the down stream compression *even* worse).",1531597198

cordcutters,"That got on my nerves, but it was a more balanced portrayal than you usually get -- the neo-Catholics aren't shown terribly sympathetically, and the practical advantages of physical immortality are constantly reinforced. In fact, the neo-C's are there mainly as a foil, as someone for other characters to be arguing with as they argue *for* immortality, or at least for living beyond the death of a single body.

So while there is that argument that living forever only makes rich assholes even more obscenely rich while the poor stay poor, that's not the only message there. And if you were to try to extract a single message from the show, it would probably be something like: Maybe *immortality* is too much, but one human lifespan isn't enough.

If homes have more channels and boxes they'd pay more for cable. If homes use more water and more electricity they'd pay more. I'm not sure why there aren't some better tiers for data.


That said, they need some reasonably priced levels. On my cellphone you can get a 1GB plan for $45 and an unlimited plan for $90 and some plans in between, it's not that hard to do figure out some steps without ""overages"".

*Wow!* charges me $40 for 100/10Mbps and they don't have a data cap. If that's their price point here then something like?

* $30 for &lt; 200GB

* $40 for &lt; 500GB

* $50 for &lt; 1TB

It also appears you've done troubleshooting and mostly ruled out amplification issues.

I agree that a roof antenna would be a pain to install and an unnecessary expense if the rest of your channels all work well, unless CBS carries all of your favorite programming. One (relatively) cheap solution to try and confirm if it is an antenna problem would be trying out a pair of rabbit ears style antenna which people often have better success with for picking up VHF stations.

cordcutters,"I had a job that I traveled a ton, I just couldn't justify cable, so I went down to internet only and had rabbit ears antenna.  This was about 8 years ago. I was with out cable for a long time (3 years-ish?) , it wasn't about money really. The issue I had with going without cable then was streaming sports.  It was a pain, to get stuff onto the big screen (local baseball, basketball, hockey all are blacked out, college football) and when I did have stream it was just terrible quality. Comcast raised their internet only, but then offered me a 2 bundle with cable for $99. So for $30 a month, I had HD and a lot more channels and clear local sports. They have raised my ""bundle"" every year. I have to call every year to get a new ""bundle/promotion"". That $99 bundle is now $125 and it's missing a few channels.  Besides local sports, there is nothing on cable at all of me. If I watch ""tv"" it's mostly over the traditional over the air channels and shows anyways. How many times do I need to watch American Pickers, or some other fake ""reality"" show? Streaming sports sites seem to be much better at sports now.   And I'm not cutting because of JUST the money savings. It's not like the $50 a month I will save will affect my life at all.  It's just that cable TV is a terrible product.

The Asus AC 1900 class router I'm using works fine, I can stream (upnp/dlna) stuff even while copying (SMB/NAS) a new one to the drive.  I'm using USB 3.0 and that is much faster than USB 2.0, I'm not sure how many movies or files I can stream at once/how many files I can transfer at the same time, that is limited by the speed of the drive and the speed of the USB connection, and if you are using WiFi how many users you have on the band (2.4 or 5 Ghz) at the same time, as WiFi throughput (bandwidth) is a finite number and it is shared by all the users by band.  If you are using gigabit wired (Ethernet) then the SMB/NAS/DLNA will be slower and be the limiting factor.

I highly recommend that you use a USB 3.0 drive and an router that supports USB 3.0.  Also pick one that has gigabit support (Wan and Lan) because you will need that if your internet is any faster than 100mbs, or you won't be able to use all the internet you are paying for.  

I use a mix of wired and WiFi, and have slowly upgraded to gigabit wired in the house, and now where SMB/NAS access would max out at 100mbs (the speed of Ethernet), now I can easily push/pull 200Mbs or 25MBs from a USB 3.0 drive attached to the ASUS.  Of course if you experience buffering, then it's time to cut back on file transfers to/from the SMB/NAS.  But I don't think I can recall having any problems streaming while copying new files to the streaming drive.

ISPs have peering agreements so they typically don't pay for data as long it is fairly symmetrical. So as an example Comcast and Verizon have a peering contract, data must transit comcasts network backbone to get to Verizon and vice versa so as long as the amounts of data are similar they call it even.

Actually, it's even worse because large ISPs not only charge you and I but they also charge at the source, Netflix for instance pays Comcast to stream to customers on comcasts network so it really is a form of double dipping.

cordcutters,"What speeds are you paying for? (If you have 25Mbps or faster you internet speed is not the issue with streaming)

What hardware did your ISP give you? Make &amp; model#?

What seems to be the issue? Streaming? Slow overall internet connection?

What devices are you accessing the internet services on? TV? Phone? Laptop? Desktop?

How are your devices actually connected to the router? Wireless? Ethernet?

----

The reason I ask all these questions is because there is no definite answer as to what could be the issue. For example, If you're trying to watch a streaming service on  a Smart TV that has a wireless connection to your network equipment. There are many reasons why you might be experiencing buffering:

- Signal is too weak due to interference (too many walls/other devices)

- Router is old (ISP hardware is generally outdated)

- The WiFi chip built into the Smart TV is really crappy (TV manufacturers don't use the best hardware for wireless technology)

- Your ISP is throttling your services

----

The I suggest starting with the most basic troubleshooting first.

- First and foremost, DO NOT USE SPEEDTEST.NET to check your speeds. It will lie to you! Use `www.fast.com`

- Reboot the network equipment

- Reboot end user device(s)

- Check to see which wireless channel you are on and find a less congested channel.

- Try 2.4GHz vs 5GHz

- Use an Ethernet cable to eliminate issues with wireless.

- Buy newer consumer grade Network Equipment (return ISP garbage)",1532006805

cordcutters,"From the top comment. What a perfect analogy. 

&gt;Would you accept this?

You walk down the street, and you see a sign that says: ""COLD BEER $3!""

It's a hot day, you are thirsty, and you decide that a pint of beer would be delicious. So you go into the bar with the sign out front, sit at the bar.... and order a cold beer.

You get your beer, and with much enjoyment you drink the golden liquid. Refreshing. You nod to the barkeep that it is time to settle the tab, and after he hands you the bill... you notice this:

Beer: $3.
- Refrigeration Fee: $1.
- Glass washing surcharge: $0.75
- Air Conditioning surcharge: $0.50
- Liquor License Recovery Fee: $1
- Tap System Maintenance Fee: $0.75

TOTAL: $7.

Wait a minute.... you tell the barkeep: ""You are advertising beer for $3 outside! How is it that I have to pay $7?""

The barkeep goes to explain and tells you a sob story about how the city has increased their liquor license fees, and the water company has increased the water rates which makes washing glasses more expensive, and the electricity company increased their rates making it more expensive to cool the building and to refrigerate the kegs..... and equipment maintenance prices are increasing too. So, he HAS to charge all these extra fees.

Now... in the real world, this doesn't happen. Sure, there are happy hour prices designed for you to come in and hopefully consume more than just a happy hour beer, but on average.... if you sell your beer for $6, and some of the costs mentioned above are rising, a barkeeper would just increase the price of beer to $7, and call it a day. If a customer asks, its just increased cost of doing business.... but he certainly isn't going to give you a sob story how all the other businesses and governments he has to deal with are increasing their prices.

Yet.... this is EXACTLY what cable companies are doing. You wouldn't accept this in a restaurant. You wouldn't accept this in a store. Why would you accept it from your cable company?

Without a router, only a single wired device would be able to connect to the modem and it'd be visible to the public internet, which is highly ill-advised. And contrary to what many people think, you can't just connect a switch to a modem to get more ports. Only a router can make use of a switch.

I enjoyed being able to watch a range of different games as Fox Sports was part of my Hulu/Vue/YTTV subscription but I don't want to see the range of games enough to be willing to pay an additional $9.99 p/m or $79.99 a season.

On the flip side though if you only really care about a single team you will likely pay less than that by paying for each individual game ($2.99 each) -

Assuming your team goes all the way to the final (from the group stage) you would be looking at either 13 (Champions League) or 15 (Europa League) games so you'd be paying $38.87 or $44.85 for the season which is cheaper than the annual pass.

Also it occurs to me that even if you want to watch every game the $9.99 p/m is marginally cheaper than the annual pass if you cancel it for January when there are no Champions League or Europa League games ($79.92 vs $79.99) so surprised the annual pass was not at least $10 or so cheaper",1533064866
cordcutters,"I’m still not entirely sure why you’re weighing the change or what your intentions are going forward.  A single HD stream uses less than 10 Mbps so moving from 200 megs to gigabit will not have any impact on your streaming performance.

As for the cable vs. streaming debate, that likely comes down to personal preference. If bundling internet and cable is cheaper, there’s no reason not to do it.  Most cable plans give access to all of the network TV Everywhere apps.  If you’d rather use the network apps instead of cable box, you can certainly do that. 

If you can get acceptable service and cheaper prices with internet alone + a streaming service subscription, go that route. In addition to Directv Now, PS Vue, Hulu, Sling YouTube TV and Philo all have streaming products.  Though you’ll have to look carefully at channel packages AND TV Everywhere app support to know exactly what you’re getting. All have free trials.

&gt;For mounting, I have a chimney, but am not sure if I'd prefer a gable mount kit, or would directly to the roof be better?

It might depend on the sturdiness of those locations. For gable mounts you have to be sure you are attaching to something structural instead of just the trim. A regular tripod bolted to the peak of the roof is often a bit higher and can by quite sturdy but has the disadvantage that you have to bolt it back on to the roof after the shingles are replaced.

In general a preamp at the antenna will give the best results as an amplifier negates the effects of the cable/splitters after it. The catch is that the preamp needs to be powered through the cable and normal splitters block the power. You would have to get special power passing splitters or rerun some cable so that you can get a power injector close to an outlet.

Some representative examples  of the sorts of things people use for preamps:

* Winegard LNA200
* RCA RCATVPRAMP1R (has separate VHF/UHF inputs)

You are not ‘locked’ into Apple’s ecosystem with the Apple TV any more than you are ‘locked’ into the Roku ecosystem. That is a bunk talking point. The streaming apps are free to download, and you just install them as you would on any other system.

More apps? Maybe. More quality apps? Nope.

A better remote is subjective, and you can use any remote with the ATV.

The starting ATV is 149, not 180.

If you want to be future proof, you need specs that can handle new tech. If you don’t want Dolby Vision or Atmos, skip the Apple TV. If you want less space, and a slower CPU/GPU, skip the Apple TV. Devices without the things mentioned, will be less. Makes sense.

Correct, you do not need to spend a ton for a ‘good’ experience, but for the ‘best’ experience, it will be a bit more. When looking at specs, the ATV and Shield are priced appropriately.

Like I said before, pay more now and be future proof or buy cheap now (and then again to keep up with new tech which would be the same price or more at the end of the day).

One doesn’t have to like Apple to like or use the Apple TV. Roku dominates for a reason, and I would argue it’s not because of stability or lack of issues, but because of price. Fair enough!

cordcutters,"It's hard to compare this show to other things as it's a unique blend of a few genres like sci-fi, crime and drama. The key thing that everything in this show revolves around is that in this world people can evade death as long as this device that's been placed in them doesn't get damaged. As long as that thing is intact it can be moved from body to body and the person continues living, but obviously looks like a different person. So this key concept enables the writers to put a unique spin on things you've seen already like detectives solving crimes, people coming to terms with mortality, class struggles in society, etc.

Corrosion is a possibility.  There is no way I can climb the tower to check on things, 48 &amp; a bad knee.  I was really hoping there would be a few simple &amp; cheap things to try before having to have them come out and check on things again.  If I do have them come out do you think it would do any good to have them switch the antenna positions or would it likely not matter?  The Dayton antenna is on top of the post with the Indy antenna about 4-5' lower.  My HAM antenna is a home made antenna and is mounted on the side of the tower about 10' down from the others.

cordcutters,"I would suggest staying away from Netgear products.  In a prior post, I stated the following:

&gt;You may see Netgear products highly rated on various websites, but from time to time I've had issues with them. With many Netgear routers, you receive three free months of customer support, and then they want an additional $80-120 for six months of support. So, I would suggest staying away.

If you look at the last two reviews for the product you posted, you will see they are both indicating something similar.  After 90 days, you have to pay for any support, so you could be out $110, or have to pay $80 for another 180 days of support for each device (so possibly $160).

For a modem, you could get a TP-Link modem, like this:  [https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TC-7610-Download-343Mbps-Certified/dp/B010Q29YF8](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-TC-7610-Download-343Mbps-Certified/dp/B010Q29YF8).  I have not used this device, since I am in Spectrum territory and we receive a free modem to use.

As for router, I would suggest a Google Wifi.  My testing has shown consistent performance, it has 1 year of customer support, and I have never come across any problems.  I have them at client sites, with family &amp; friends, and I use them for work purposes.  Here's a link for the 1-pack:  [https://www.amazon.com/Google-WiFi-system-1-Pack-replacement/dp/B01MDJ0HVG](https://www.amazon.com/Google-WiFi-system-1-Pack-replacement/dp/B01MDJ0HVG)

So, the TP-Link modem and Google Wifi router will cost you a combined $153, just slightly over you're $150 budget.

As for when the promotional period ends, I would suggest calling up your ISP for the non-promotional pricing.  Ask what the actual cost will be, including additional fees and taxes.

It is nice to have CNN though to catch up on the news when you don't have the time to read stuff since you're out and about traveling.

I'm not exactly sure if you are trying to make a point.

I could easily say: News stations are one of the worst ways to ruin a vacation. You're on vacation - there shouldn't be any reason to watch the news on TV.

Additionally, if you really believe one should not spend time on the TV while vacationing, why not just advocate that hotels not have them to begin with? If they are providing it, it's because they're signaling some kind of value by having it. I'm merely pointing out that the value is not the same as what it was two decades ago.

cordcutters,"It's entirely possible that the signal from WIBW 13 is actually stronger from their new antenna than it was with the old one. You may find that rotating the antenna over maybe a 45º arc can find a better signal.

The reason for this is that digital TV (ATSC 1.0) is very sensitive to multipath reception, that is signals coming from more than one direction at a time due to reflections from mountains, buildings, towers, etc. Signal dropouts and freezes such as you describe are almost always caused by multipath. 

Also, depending on your distance from the station, your high-gain antenna plus the increased signal from the station could be overloading your amplifier. 

Are you using multiple antennas (like a VHF and UHF) with a combiner? Sometimes multiple antennas can interfere with each other and actually reduce a particular channel. It is much better to use a combination UHF-VHF antenna than separate antennas with a combiner.

Hope this helps!

DUDE! Yes, they are. But you say it like they're not connected at all.  Comcast doesn't just mail you a box of 2TB of internet via FedEx, it goes over some infrastructure. That infrastructure doesn't handle infinite amounts data, there are limitations.


If everyone in your neighborhood tries to download 1TB a month, assuming vide streaming take that MUCH of that bandwidth is in the evening, at what point is enough data being downloaded that it's affecting the local ""node"" (the hose is only so big going to the local node) and we're not getting enough data out of it, it's going to run slower for everyone.

My mom who's just checking her mail and Facebook is barely contributing to this, someone's 4k video for the evening exceeds her whole month's worth. 

But now with all the downloading of 4k, the company needs to get more internet (they pay for it from some source right?) and they need to upgrade the infrastructure for the whole neighborhood. As these costs go up, someone has to pay for it.

cordcutters,"You are going to have to go with a big antenna to get reliable reception in your location, especially if you have any trees between you and the TV stations. Several things are working against you: 

You're a long ways from all the stations and you have some terrain causing loss of signal. Looking only at the likely stations to the east (83, 91, 74º) some of your stations are UHF, some high-band VHF (NBC 10, PBS 8) and one low-band VHF (CBS, 5) you will need a big rooftop antenna like [this](http://www.winegarddirect.com/viewitem.asp?p=hd8200u&amp;d=Winegard-Heavy-Duty-Platinum-VHF-UHF-FM-Outdoor-TV-Antenna-(HD8200U)&amp;post=) to get reliable reception. Even with the large antenna, you will probably only get the top stations with a positive noise margin (NM) reliably. Fortunately the major networks qualify except Fox (15) and it's close. 

I'd strongly recommend a [mast-mounted amplifier](https://www.amazon.com/Winegard-LNA-200-Preamplifier-Antenna-Amplifier/dp/B00DQN3R9O/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1531326532&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;keywords=mast+mounted+tv+amplifier&amp;psc=1)m tii, Mount the antenna as high as possible and aim it accurately at 74º because the other stations at 83º and 74º are probably strong enough to allow a small aiming error. If using a magnetic compass, be sure to correct for compass deviation.

I realize that many antennas are advertised to offer the range you want, but I'm recommending the big one because it has substantial gain for the VHF channels you want. Most smaller antennas have near-zero gain on VHF, especially the low-band channels 2-6. Secondly, the antenna is highly directional which will minimize the reflections you are likely to have. Those reflections are what cause the signal to cut out, especially in bad weather. 

Just think of it this way: Your antenna installation will only cost what a few months of cable will cost! ""Visually appealing"", however, is not likely to happen if you are to get any reception at all.

Then I want NBA home games from January until the end of the regular season in Mid April so I can downgrade to just Core Jan-April.  Then May-Sept I can get away with just basic level.  Unfortunately there is just about always some sport that needs cable.  NBA playoffs were largely on ESPN or TNT.   Only the final championship series was OTA totally...Right now Wimbledon is showing on ESPN.  So again OTA doesn't work.

",1530835679
cordcutters,"&gt;I think it was something about that you have to share cable with your neighbors or something. If there are heavy users in my neighborhood that would mean my internet would be slower.

What you are describing here is peak hour slow downs, which is something that hasn't been widespread since DOCSIS 2.0 was the standard for cable internet almost 10 years ago.  I vividly remember everyone getting out of school and off of work and the internet speeds plummeting to around 1mb/s (if you were lucky). This problem was for the most part solved with DOCSIS 3.0 and the fact that it can have up to 32 channels (38.7 mb/s each) down for a neighborhood node. At this point Cable has matured much better than DSL and still has life in it whereas DSL is at its end of life. In many areas the copper lines have even been removed completely were operators are using fiber now.

&gt;And in the evening when many people are at home and surfing it would also affect my wifi speed. that's how i understood it.

If your router (and devices) support it switch to the 5GHz band. It has less range, but also far less interference giving you the best performance over WIFI. Also, I would hardwire devices that can be, saving you from a lot of networking issues. ",1531168813
cordcutters,"Step 1:  Continue to regularly test and document your results.  Keep a document with the date, time, test provider, and test results of each test.  Keep this at your fingertips to send to every person you talk to at Charter

Step 2:  Call charter and report the problem and provide your results **regularly**, like every day, or at least several times a week.

Throughput issues are notoriously difficult for an ISP to troubleshoot.  They simply don't have an easy way to look at your service, or run a simple test, and say 'oh yea, this guy really is having an issue'.  On top of that, speed issues are *frequently* misreported by users (for a variety of reasons).  When a throughput issue is reported to support, the default assumption is that you may not really be having an issue, and when they do some basic checks and don't *see* any issue, it reinforces their assumption.  Their primary goal at this point is to move your issue off of their plate so they can move onto the next one.  This isn't really even them trying to blow you off, but rather trying to spend their time on an issue that they feel they can actually do something about.

You have to break through this by letting them know that, 1) You *really* are having a valid issue, and 2) You aren't going away until it is addressed.

You are probably going to have to get to the 2nd or 3rd tier of support before you reach someone with the tools and knowledge to properly investigate, so you have to be persistent.  When they try telling you there isn't an issue, politely but firmly request that the issue be *escalated*, either to the next tier of support, or to management.

So if you have two phones only one can be talking to the ap at a given time effectively reducing the bandwidth by half. For every device you add the situation gets worse.

Lookup hubs vs switches in wired networking and you see the problem! Due to physics wireless will always act like a hub and as with a hub, the more devices you have the worse it gets. I've been in IT for 20 years and I would ALWAYS choose a wire if possible over wireless.

Did you rescan for channels when you tried each coax cable?

The tv and associated electronics are also likely causing interference. You want the antenna facing the direction of towers and placed in a window or exterior wall away from electronics. You also want it as high as possible. Hopefully the correct direction is not through your neighbors' units if you share common walls.

Does your house have aluminum or metal siding, a metal roof, a radiant barrier, or metal screens or rebar in the walls? These also cause interference.

Can you try the antenna on the second or third floor/attic? Can you try it on a porch (even just temporarily to determine if the house is the issue)?

For indoor antennas, I recommend a winegard flatwave or rabbit ears. Both get VHF signals better than Mohu.

YTTV was great, but when they started replacing recorded shows with VOD streams that did not allow ad skipping, it became unusable for us.  

To get an ad-free experience on Hulu, we pay the $4/month extra for ad-free VOD streaming, and the $15/month extra for the 200 hour enhanced DVR, which unlike the 50 hour DVR allows ad-skipping.

As far as the service goes, YTTV has a better guide and DVR (except for the VOD ads).  Both services attempt to extend live events, but YTTV does a better job of this, and there is no option (at least in Hulu, not sure about YTTV) to manually extend sporting events.

The problem you'll find is that that's the fastest voice-enabled non-combo modem you can purchase, and it tops out at ~300Mbps (8/4 configuration).  If you pay for a higher speed plan with Comcast, you're stuck using one of their Gateway devices, though again you can [buy those yourself if you want](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-Internet-services-C7100V-1AZNAS/dp/B078FBC499/).  The problem is you have to hack around if you don't want to use their shitty built-in routing in favor of something better like /r/pfsense.

Comcast may also try to tell you that if you pay for digital voice, you *must* use a digital voice modem.  That's also 100% bullshit.  Just because I pay for a service doesn't mean I have to use it (oftentimes Triple Play bundles will be cheaper than Double Play or a la carte).

[Link to info on their packages](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/network/vue/channels/?smcid=explore-channels:cover:pdc:network:vue:home). I have a feeling that of the options you may like this the best, since it has a wide array of channels, the option to add in sports packages, and includes Disney which should satisfy the kids when they visit. 

I would also check out Philo [link to their website](https://try.philo.com/) which has cheaper packages but generally less channels. It is also very well liked by many on the sub.

You could also check out Plex. I have a writeup on them in my post history but generally feel like they are doing good things and continuing to improve. They also work well with antenna for OTA solutions for local channels.

Yes, that is technically an exterior wall.  Why?  Condominiums are divided into three parts: the ""common elements,"" or the portion of the condominium development that is equally owned by all owners of all units; ""unit elements,"" or the portion of the development that is solely owned by an owner of a unit (this is what people think of when they refer to ""a condo""); and ""limited common elements,"" which are the parts that are not inside a unit and are legally owned by all owners *but* are reserved by the condo association for a single owner's sole use.

Your unit is all of that interior space that extends from the opposite side of the drywall in your house inward into your house, plus any electrical, cable, or telephone wires, and any plumbing pipes that solely serve your unit.  Your unit is not anything on the other side of that, including the studs in the wall that make up the exterior perimeter of your unit.

This is where it gets interesting: check your condo declaration and the legal description of your condo.  I am pretty sure that your patio is considered a limited common element, so it is not part of your unit, thus the closet and the wall inside the closet are still ""exterior.""

cordcutters,"Disney is already going to setup their own streaming service to rival Netflix.  If they are smart and put ALL their content in it, they could make a killing.  If they do some lame ""Disney vault"" shit then fuck that though.

The fact is people don't really want to buy Blu-rays any more.  They will stream Moana on Netflix instead of put the disc in.  How many Disney discs to people buy a year?

If they charged $10 a month for streaming, that's a guaranteed $120 per year.  I'd have to buy 5 or 6 discs each year to make up for that, and most people probably don't buy that many that often.

So yeah they might lose on sales of physical media but they'd get the recurring revenue for a long time.  Every time someone has a kid they sign up for Disney streaming and keep it for 10 years because it's a great babysitter... that's way more money than just selling discs.

Yes internet only is priced higher then a bundled package, this is not new nor a result of cord cutting explosion.   Comcast has always, or atleast in my area charged $20 more for internet only vs internet with a tv package. 

I pay $79.99 a month for my internet only package with a 1 terabyte cap (which I never exceed) , and $15 a month for my tv service . My all in monthly bill is $95 a month for my tv entertainment.  I don’t use Netflix or any of the other mainstream streaming services.  I use a indoor antenna for my locals ( wife has to have local news lol).  We have 2 tv’s ,   3 computers, 2 Nvidia Shields, 3 cellphones, 2 google minis, and 7 wireless switches all connected to my network with no issues as far as bandwidth goes. 

Initial investment is what will set ya back a bit depending on what ecosystem you want to go with. For me it was Nvidia Shield, $200 for 1 box, $300 for the other (pro model), $100 for my HDHOMERUN box to tie my antenna into my network, I’ve made this back 3x over already. 

Now the experience is what you will need to get used to. It’s not an all in one system like traditional tv service, it’s more close to a cell phone experience, an app for this, an app for that type a thing.

You will have glitches and such from time to time. Although in my experience Comcast internet is stable as hell, where as thier tv service, atleast for me sucked.

cordcutters,"I ran that setup before completely ditching cable. The problem is that Roku devices can't play MPEG2 natively so you need an app to transcode. Plex (with Plex Pass) did that very well for me. You should try paying for one month of Plex Pass just to see how it works for you before diving into the lifetime subscription.

Otherwise, I had also used some Plex channels before they integrated HDHomerun support. I believe [HDGrandSlam](https://forum.silicondust.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=42711) was the easiest to setup and most reliable. It's just not as nice and pretty as the native Plex Pass way of handling it.

Finally, make sure your settings in your Plex app allow for higher bandwidth (5 to 7mbps should be fine) for local or remote, whichever you're using. 

edit: Just thought of another thing. If you're using a Plex Channel like HDGrandslam and you're seeing low quality video, it could be the case that the channel has mapped to SD version of the channel (NBC SD instead of NBC HD) but is showing the HD listing. These apps trying to auto-detect your channel guide either by name or number and they're not perfect. You should double-check the mapping in the settings of that channel to make sure they are all mapped to the correct HDHomerun channels.",1531690712
cordcutters,"We've tried all the OTT services except Hulu's live offering.   We had Sling originally a couple of years ago, and tried it again just last month when we got a 30 day free trial.   

I would easily rate Sling the worst of all the services we've tried.  Picture quality, only one stream on some channels, loud commercials, a guide that makes no sense (perhaps the alphabetic guides ruined us) are all contributing factors to that opinion.   Plus to be truly comparable to some of the other services, it would cost more after all the add-ons.   I'm sure others love Sling, and having lots of competition is good, so I'm glad they are there, but I'd never pay for them again.  

YTTV impressed during the free trial we had.  Picture quality was very good, stream was very stable, and absolutely love the guide customization where you can order channels any way you want and even hide channels from the guide that you don't want to see.   The service is just missing a lot of channels we'd prefer in our live TV offering.

cordcutters,"Well the antenna you picked is supposed to have good range and performance, it has an amplifier built in.  

You might have to look into an ""outdoor"" or ""attic"" antenna with a preamp.  

I see from the tvfool report that the closest transmitter is 15 miles away, and the main channels you want at 25ish miles away.  I think that is a bit far for a flat indoor or any small indoor antenna to be able to get a good and strong signal.

The companies advertise ranges, but I think/feel as it those numbers are almost a scam.   

Have you tried different antenna placement and directions?  I know it sucks to have to re-scan pretty much every time, but placement and direction makes a huge difference.  Also the higher and closer to the exterior you put the antenna the more signal it can get, of course the antenna should be put on the side that faces the transmitters. 

Also, you kind need to not be holding the antenna while doing testing, your body will affect the reception, I ended up using painters tape to stick the antenna on the wall (to keep from making a bunch of small holes) I tried different locations until I found the best compromise location (way up high almost touching the ceiling, mostly facing the main transmitter locations).  Scanning didn't really work with me holding the antenna, because even small movements had a big effect on the picture.  I suspect if you live in a strong signal area, then this would not be as big an issue... 

You could also try adding another amp in line with the one built into the antenna, it would go on the end of the box where the power is injected, where you would normally connect the TV, that might be able to boost the signal, but it will also introduce more ""noise"" and that may cancel out any potential benefit, but you won't know until you try.

Finally, you are using the TVFool tool, and you can enter alternate antenna heights to see how much it ""improves"" the signal.

I hope you found this info to be useful.

Pick any used one from amazon warehouse for dirt cheap.

The only thing I would suggest is get a model that has a removable coax option.  Most antennas come with 6-10ft cord.  In your situation you may want a short one if you get good reception right in the back of your TV, or swap it out for something super long if you need to drag antenna to the different location.   Using couplers will cause signal loss.  It's much better just to swap out the cable.

cordcutters,"I’m all for change if it’s for good. But, given AT&amp;T’s track record, I just don’t trust them to do right by HBO.

The author of this article presents a couple of ideas that I agree with and one that I don’t necessarily agree with. He suggests that, like Netflix, HBO releases all episodes at once vs. weekly. For an existing show like GoT, this would be welcomed, but for new series, I’d initially stick with weekly episodes so the show can build buzz. The volume at which Netflix releases shows is overwhelming and thus, sometimes difficult to keep up with. I fear some of the lesser-known Netflix series don’t get to build a window of buzz they deserve because of the release-all-eps method. And I think the same would happen if HBO suddenly adapted Netflix’s strategy of mass quantity AND releasing full seasons at a time. 

I do believe there’s an opportunity for HBO to grow/evolve from what it currently is, but I don’t know if copying Netflix’s playbook is the way to go. HBO has a long tradition of being a prestige network and I don’t want that to change for the sake of mining subscriber data for AT&amp;T to get richer.

The TV content field is only going to get more crowded with the likes of Apple set to launch their own service and other networks vying for more eyes with even more quality shows.

You didn't provide a TVFool report so I'm going to assume that you're at Saint Agnes Hospital at 900 S Caton Ave, Baltimore, MD 21229. The TVFool report for that location shows that everything from Baltimore is easy to get and that everything coming from DC are 1 and 2 edge signals. Those DC signals may be difficult to pick up if there are a lot of trees between the antenna and the source. Some people have had luck removing the back reflector off of the 8-bay and getting ok reception in a line, but this reduces the strength of the antenna and removes all VHF reception meaning you're not going to get NBC out of Baltimore or ABC or CBS out of DC. 

Depending on your exact location, and which channels you want, you have a few options. You can get a directional antenna and a rotator which will allow you to get a stronger antenna which may have better luck with the DC signals.

cordcutters,"What people don't get is, for condos and sometimes townhouses the exterior wall is actually not yours. In condos especially, what you own is drywall and inside. Any exterior wall or space between divider wall is considered common space which you don't have right to use without permission.

For many living in cities or modern suburbs, condos or townhouses are pretty much the only option as they don't build many single family homes anymore.

For planned communities where there is an HOA for single family houses, the HOA would usually only be responsible for common areas such as parks etc and their landscaping. In those cases, your house is really yours but HOA can still dictate how your house's exterior looks. Although for antennas and solar panels (in some states) there is goverment regulation that prevents them from disallowing those.

cordcutters,"&gt; installed to connect the antenna to the splitter they set up

Generally Satellite splitters are optimized for frequencies higher than that for TV.   You might want to check this and replace it if necessary.   

That is a nice full frequency antenna.  Should work fine otherwise.  It's very unlikely that you will pick up that ABC station reliably with that splitter, but you should try it with a direct run.   When the NM is less than 0, it becomes very very tough to receive. 

As for grounding, you have to ground both the mast and signal ground. Do not connect them together. Do not drive any additional ground rods which commonly is advised, but it's not to code and causes ground loops.  You will want to connect them to the existing house ground.

cordcutters,"&gt;I read something about running an ethernet cable from the box outside my house into my apartment so I can connect my own router. This is no bueno because my landlords are very particular.

Yeah if you can't get an Ethernet cable to be ran from the ONT to inside your apartment, you're going to need the G1100 router that supports the coax from the ONT. If you are getting gigabit, they have no choice but to run the Ethernet cable because you can't do Gigabit over the coax. 

Fios doesn't use a modem per-se because the outside ONT is the modem.

&gt;If I do buy the Verizon thing, can I still hook up my own Google router to it? Do I even need that Verizon electronics box?

If they can't run an Ethernet cable from the ONT to your unit, you're going to need the G1100 router so the coax can be hooked up but you can also plug in your own router to it to use as the router.

If you need the G1100 I suggest buying a used on off ebay because they go for a lot less than $150. (got mine for $75 a few years ago)",1532612401
cordcutters,"If the amplifier is at the TV you might want to try taking it out of the line to see if it is actually helping things. If you have any significant amount of cable length or splitters an amplifier at the antenna could help a bit (the LNA-200 is such am amp). You might want to put a bit of silicone grease in the connectors and a bunch more around the sealing edges of any boot.

Hard to predict what might happen if you move the antenna. In general, higher is better as you are clearing more obstructions. You might want to think if that is true in your case.

&gt;Should I get an omnidirectional antenna?

The one you have now is probably as close as you are going to get for an omnidirectional antenna. The catch is that your antenna (and things sold as omnidirectional) have very little performance. As you increase the level of performance the antenna gets larger and more directional. That makes your situation somewhat tricky.

Some of you need to go take a business class.

So maybe you don't need some of those services - then fine - choose an alternative that doesn't offer some of the mainstream improvements that likely are causing prices to go up.

I am by no means defending DTVNOW - I trialed them in early 2017 and it was a complete disaster.  However, I have seen prices go up on Vue, YTTV, Sling, etc - and they have added features and functionality to their services as they've matured - so it would make sense that a price increase could come.

cordcutters,"**The Erosion of Cable TV Subscribers May Soon Become A Deluge**




The erosion of traditional Pay TV is continuing but when a realistic broadband Internet alternative becomes available, the erosion may become a rout.


The latest data from eMarketer (see here) is showing that cord cutting is accelerating but not by enough to panic the cable TV companies. eMarketer’s data shows a slight acceleration in the decline of cable TV subscribers to 3.8% from 3.4% in 2017, indicating that the integration of traditional services with those of Netflix have not really had any impact. There will still be 186.7m US adults watching cable TV in 2018, meaning that the business is still very large despite its continual decline.


This scale is likely to mean that the warning bells have not been headed in cable TV’s corridors of power although it does seem to have realised the importance of content. This is why the sector is locked in a big wave of vertical consolidation.


Content is king and if the content that users want and are willing to pay for is freely available on the Internet, then there is very little point in paying for $100+ for a cable TV subscription. This leaves the cable TV companies with only fast and reliable broadband Internet access as a desirable product. This can already be observed as 56% of cable TV subscribers only keep their subscription in order to get access to fast and reliable internet (see here)


This is also under threat as one of the best use cases for the new wireless technology known as 5G is fixed wireless access. 5G’s ability to use huge blocks of unlicensed spectrum combined with sophisticated tricks with radios and antennae would enable cost-effective competition with both fibre and cable delivered internet access. Furthermore, with no requirement to dig up the roads and (potentially) user-installed receiving units, the cost to roll it out would be far lower. This would make it possible to have very competitively priced internet-only access in the USA for the first time. With this scenario, the cable companies will either have to cut their prices massively or face losing most of their business.


It at this point that the gradual decline may become a deluge as the last reason to subscribe to cable TV will have been removed. This represents an existential threat to the cable tv industry that will need to rethink its proposition to survive. The result will be much smaller, more innovative but less profitable cable companies offering better customer service than they do today.


The alternative is to be remembered as case studies of dominant companies that fell by the wayside because they refused to move with the times. It is unlikely that many of their customers would be sad to see them go.

cordcutters,"&gt;Those leagues/teams will want to be paid

not true, minor leagues would do it for the exposure in local markets to build their brand and the millions of cord cutters like me who have a interest in sports without cable would watch the occasional midmajor basketball game.    Missouri Valley basketball currently makes nothing from their ESPN TV deal and they do it for the ESPN exposure, even though they could probably make more money going elsewhere.  If you were the only legit national OTA sports channel, people would be bending over backwards for that exposure. 

&gt;Also, will this hypothetical OTA channel only broadcast 4 or 5 regional feeds to save money (but fail to draw interest by people who couldn't care less about a lacrosse match 3 hours away), or will it try to have 30 or 60 separate sub-regional feeds across the country? (Is there even enough content -- both local and national -- that they can acquire the rights and pay overhead cheaply enough for 12 hours a day of that?)

It would be just like a regular OTA with 1 national feed and then certain time slots that the local station can fill with whatever.   Just like now, not all ABC's have a local news, but most do, some show reruns of sitcoms during that hour..  

They could easily just show the same sports segment from the local news and then show some extended highlights so it wouldn't take much extra work or manpower to have a local segment for the ""sportscenter"" type show.  Just like on the morning show on CBS, they send it to the local stations to do the weather, then go back to the national feed.     Even my hometown of Springfield, MO, they have an extended 30 minute high school football highlight show after the friday night local news, so the top 50-100 markets could make it work I think. ",1532391878
cordcutters,"Good summary. A few points I’ll add: 

- You are correct about the VOD replacement on YouTube TV but I’ve never seen it happen on sports programming. 

- YTTV DVR allows unlimited storage and retains recordings up to 9 months. PlayStation Vue is also unlimited but deletes content after 28 days.  Directv Now will only store 20 hours of programming and deletes after 30 days. An enhanced DVR option is supposed to launch soon for DTVN for an added fee. 

- DTVN does not allow rewind or fast forward of live TV *unless* you are recording. YTTV and I believe PS Vue do allow you to REW/FF shows being viewed live. 

- DTVN DVR scheduling for sports is pretty archaic. I could never find a way to create a “series” recording that would grab all of a team’s game. Only option was to pull up every game in the program guide and individual schedule the recording.  With YTTV you can easily set a recording by team (e.g. one tap/click to record all Atlanta Braves games.) Been a while since I used Vue but back then the only option was to record an entire sport, like EVERY college football game. Not a huge deal since recording space is unlimited, but it does put a lot of extra stuff in your list of recordings.

Full disclosure: I spent about 16 months with DTVN but switched to YouTube TV back in April.  I won’t hide my bias...YTTV is better in nearly every regard. Many people seem to stay with DTVN for price, and that’s their prerogative. To me, the bugs, glitches and errors just aren’t worth it. (I didn’t even touch on the errors here—scheduled recordings that dont happen, recordings that won’t play back, poor audio or video quality.)
